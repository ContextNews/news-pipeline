That's more than the combined deaths of terror attacks, riots, epidemics and natural disasters.\nAir pollution is no longer just Delhi's problem as it is affecting the whole of the Indo-Gangetic plain, with hundreds of millions of people breathing toxic air.\nAccording to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, 150 cities of the 256 cities monitored in 2025 exceeded nationally recommended PM2.5 levels.\nFor years governments have ignored this issue in India's capital, their measures temporary and miserably inadequate, banning polluting vehicles and stopping construction when the air quality index reaches certain levels.\nTrucks with water sprinklers are seen moving around Delhi's 18,000-mile road network trying to suppress matter in the air. The government has also been accused of inconsistent record collection and manipulating data, and spraying water at monitoring stations to influence the readings.\nFarm fires - a centuries-old practice by farmers of burning crop stubble to clear land for the next sowing cycle - have been one of the primary reasons for air pollution.\nThe Supreme Court of India banned this practice, even imposing fines and ordering the arrest of violators.\nLighting the stubble on his field, Ram Singh, a farmer from Haryana, says: \"It's up to the government to arrest us, they can put us in jail.\"\n\"We will eat in jail,\" he adds. Our families barely survive on these crops. Nothing is left from it, we do not cause air pollution, it's all the rich industries that do it, and we get the blame.\"\nAs most of India is associated with agriculture, the government dares not upset the farming community.\n'Not possible' to escape dangerous air\nBut that's no help to Alok Ranjan, a GP at the MMG District Hospital in Ghaziabad. On average, he sees over 300 patients during winter.\nHe says most come with breathing problems and the numbers increase by 50% due to pollution and the cold.\n\"Air pollutants have many elements that are carcinogenic, like lead, mercury, cadmium, that can cause cancer - these are toxic and harmful for our bodies and metabolism,\" he says, a queue of patients snaking into the hospital corridor.\n\"Air pollution has an effect on all organs of our body. Our life expectancy has reduced while morbidity increased.
