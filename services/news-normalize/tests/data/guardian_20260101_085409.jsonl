The band’s contract runs until 2029.\nAdor is also suing an unnamed member of Danielle’s family and the band’s former producer Min Hee-jin for damages and as part of a contract break penalty, alleging they both bore “significant responsibility for causing this dispute and for NewJeans’ departure and delayed return”.\nSouth Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported that the total amount sought from the three individuals amounts to nearly 43.1bn won (US$30m, £22m, A$45m).\nNewJeans made headlines in November 2024 when they announced their decision to leave Ador, prompting the company to request an injunction barring them from any commercial activities. That request was granted in March.\nDanielle’s contract has been terminated, the label said on Monday, as it was “determined that it would be difficult for her to continue as … an artist under Ador”.\nThe label claimed that NewJeans’ members had been “exposed to persistently distorted and biased information” which had led to “significant misunderstandings”.\nThe Guardian has reached out to Danielle for comment.\nAccording to Ador, three of the group’s four remaining members have decided to stay with the label, while member Minji is still in talks with the company.\nNewJeans, which made its debut in 2022, is among Hybe’s most successful acts. After the lawsuit against Danielle was announced, fans took to social media with the slogan: “NewJeans is five or nothing”.\nThe dramatic contractual dispute erupted last year following allegations that Hybe had forced out Min, the band’s producer, from her role as Ador’s CEO.\nNewJeans members later issued an ultimatum demanding Min’s reinstatement, which Hybe rejected. The members then went public with their grievances, alleging the company had deliberately undermined their careers.\nVietnamese-Australian band member Hanni Pham claimed that the band had endured mistreatment, including “deliberate miscommunications and manipulation” while working with the label. In October she delivered emotional testimony before South Korea’s parliament over the allegations, saying: “I know it’s not going to solve all the problems in the world, but if we just respect each other, at least there will be no problems with bullying and harassment in the workplace.”\nDanielle has also claimed that when she was a trainee in one of the idol boot camps, she was constantly surveilled and had to have all meals approved by management, an allegation Ador or Hybe have not responded to.\nIn October, the Seoul Central district court rejected NewJeans’s claims that the allegations had caused an “irreparable breakdown of trust” with Ador.\nWeeks later, South Korea’s employment ministry also dismissed a workplace bullying complaint made by Pham against Ador, stating that the members were not legally employees of Ador, but “exceptional entities”.\nThe spat sparked panic in the K-pop industry, as it fuelled discussions around the rights of K-pop stars as workers, a status they have been legally denied.\nIn a joint statement to Time magazine after the injunction against them was granted, the band said: “It almost feels like Korea wants to turn us into revolutionaries.”\nIn November, Ador announced that only two members, Hyein and Haerin, would be returning to the agency, sparking fears among fans that NewJeans would split up. But Hanni, Danielle and Minji released a separate statement hours later clarifying that they would also return – but now it is clear, not for long.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2026/jan/01/newjeans-member-danielle-sued-for-millions-after-bitter-feud-with-k-pop-record-label", "published_at": "2026-01-01T06:19:14+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The drills, called “Justice Mission 2025”, came closer to Taiwan than previous exercises, and involved at least 200 warplanes across the two days, the highest tally for more than a year. Taiwan said 27 missiles were also fired towards Taiwan, with several landing within 27 nautical miles of its coastline.\nOn Wednesday the drills had ended but Taiwan remained on high alert, with 25 Chinese Navy and Coast Guard ships still around Taiwan, and two surveillance balloons were dispatched with one flying across Taiwan’s northern coast line.\nThe drills were expected by analysts before the year’s end but were also connected by Chinese commentators to a recent arms approval by the US government for a record $11bn (£8bn) weapons sales to Taiwan.\nSpeaking in Beijing on Wednesday evening, Xi said China “embraced the world with open arms” and highlighted several multilateral conferences hosted by Beijing this year, including the Shanghai Cooperation Summit in August, when world leaders including Russia’s Vladimir Putin, India’s Narendra Modi and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, gathered in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing.\nThe broadcast of Xi’s speech on Chinese state media was interspersed with several shots of China’s largest ever military parade, which was held in September to mark 80 years since the end of the second world war. During the parade, which was viewed as an unbridled display of military force, Xi, Putin and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, stood side by side in Beijing – a geopolitical alignment that has been called the “axis of upheaval”.\nCentral to Xi’s vision of a new world order is the annexation of Taiwan and the support of other countries in recognising Taiwan as part of “One China” ruled by the Chinese Communist party in Beijing, something that the majority of Taiwanese people reject.\nHowever several governments criticised China’s drills this week, including the UK, Japan, Australia, the Philippines, the EU and the US. China’s foreign ministry said it had lodged “serious protests” over their remarks, erroneously claiming that those nations’ domestic policies recognised Taiwan as part of China.\n“The biggest threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is ‘Taiwan independence’ forces’ separatist activities and external connivance and support for these activities,” the ministry’s spokesman Lin Jian said on Wednesday.\nIn his speech, Xi also highlighted “Taiwan Retrocession Day”, a memorial day created in 2025 to mark the anniversary of the end of Japanese imperial rule in Taiwan in 1945. This year, Taiwan also passed a law to recognise the date, 25 October, as a national holiday. The legacy of the second world war has been a big theme in political rhetoric in China and Taiwan this year. China has emphasised its role in defeating the Japanese in that conflict, something that China feels has been underappreciated in the west. Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, gave a punchy speech this year comparing Taiwan to European democracies in the 1930s that faced a threat from Nazi Germany.\nIn his own New Year’s Day address on Thursday morning, Lai again warned of China’s “rising expansionary ambitions” and vowed to “staunchly defend national sovereignty”.\nHe also urged opposition parties in Taiwan – which control the parliament – to stop blocking a special bill which would increase Taiwan’s defence budget.\n“Facing China’s alarming military ambitions, Taiwan has no time to wait and certainly no time to consume ourselves with internal strife,” Lai said.\nXi’s speech also praised China’s progress in hi-tech development this year, mentioning kickboxing robots and Tianwen-2, a comet exploration mission that launched in May. He also flagged the global success of Chinese cultural exports, such as the video game Black Myth: Wukong and the animated film Ne Zha 2.\nEarlier in the day, Xi addressed a meeting of top Chinese Communist party officials and said that China was on track to meet its 5% GDP growth target.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/31/xi-jinping-vows-reunification-china-taiwan-new-years-eve-speech", "published_at": "2025-12-31T13:47:55+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The increase in Chinese sales has alarmed EU countries, particularly Germany and France, who fear losing millions of automotive jobs if the industry shrivels.\nNorway leads the world in EV take-up, helped by generous purchase subsidies, but in Spain and the UK a large number of the Chinese cars on offer are hybrids, which combine a petrol engine with a small battery.\nTu Le, the founder of Sino Auto Insights, a consultancy, said: “The Chinese are tackling the EU region by region since there are pockets of support in some areas and pockets of opposition in others.”\nNeither the UK nor Norway have imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, as the EU has done, leaving them open to battery car sales.\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a lobby group, Chinese manufacturers sold 187,800 cars in the UK out of total sales of 1.87m during the first 11 months of the year – double last year’s sales.\nSchmidt said the UK was a particularly juicy target for Chinese brands because it is a large market with no British mass-market champions. Rover ceased trading in the early 2000s, Vauxhall is part of the Stellantis conglomerate, while MGs are made in China by state-owned SAIC.\n“With no genuine domestic volume brands for UK consumers to choose from, UK consumers crucially can no longer participate in what is known as patriotic purchasing,” he said.\n“In Germany and France, half of each country’s new-car market is effectively in the control of domestic brands. While in China, we now also see two-thirds of the market is accounted for by domestic brands.”\nThe manufacturers that are losing out on UK sales appeared to be Japanese. Nissan and Toyota have factories in the UK but that has not prevented them from losing nearly a percentage point of market share apiece in the past year. Honda and Suzuki sales also dropped, while Mitsubishi has pulled out completely.\nThe EU imposed tariffs of between 17% and 38% on Chinese electric cars last year, in an effort to level the playing field. However, the tariffs apply to electric cars only, leaving a large back door for Chinese manufacturers to win market share by undercutting European manufacturers on sales of hybrids as well.\nSchmidt’s analysis showed that less than 40% of all Chinese-brand models entering western Europe during the third quarter of 2025 were pure battery electric. That means that the design of the EU tariffs has allowed Chinese manufacturers to continue to undercut European rivals, while also pushing them to sell more polluting models.\nThe EU watered down its targets for electric car sales recently, saying it will allow 10% of sales to continue to have internal combustion engines after 2035 – it had previously planned to ban them entirely. European carmakers had lobbied hard for the changes, arguing they need to continue selling petrol and diesel cars to earn enough profits to invest in battery car factories.\nHowever, some car executives and analysts have argued that slowing the transition in Europe will allow Chinese carmakers to race further ahead. Schmidt has forecast that Chinese manufacturers’ share will peak just shy of 10% across Europe between 2028 and 2030, while China’s share of the battery car market will peak at 13%.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/31/china-forecast-to-have-sold-one-in-every-10-new-cars-in-uk-in-2025", "published_at": "2025-12-31T09:42:26+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The Australian beef industry has never been stronger than it is today.”\nThe Nationals leader, David Littleproud, described the tariff as “devastating” while the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said Albanese should leverage his relationship with China’s president, Xi Jinping, to secure a carve out.\nBut beef producers reacted angrily to the news, with the Australian Meat Industry Council (AMIC) describing the measures as extremely disappointing”.\nThe tariffs were neither fair not appropriate, the AMIC chief executive, Tim Ryan, said, and were not reflective of the “long-standing, mutually beneficial trade relationship Australia has with China”.\n“This decision appears to reward other countries who have surged the volume of beef exported to the Chinese market in recent years,” Ryan said.\n“This decision will have a severe impact on trade flows to China over the duration of the measures’ enforcement, disrupt the longstanding relationships fostered under the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement and restrict the ability for Chinese consumers to access safe and reliable Australian beef.”\nBeef imports to China fell 0.3% in the first 11 months of this year to 2.59 million tons. Chinese beef imports will decline in 2026 as a result of the measures, said Hongzhi Xu, senior analyst at Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultants.\n“China’s beef-cattle farming is not competitive compared with countries such as Brazil and Argentina,” Xu said. “This cannot be reversed in the short term through technological advancements or institutional reforms.”\nIn 2024, China imported 1.34 million tons of beef from Brazil, 594,567 tons from Argentina, 243,662 tons from Uruguay, 216,050 tons from Australia, 150,514 tons from New Zealand and 138,112 tons from the U.S.\nIn the first 11 months of this year, Brazil shipped 1.33 million tons of beef to China, according to Chinese customs data, well above the quota levels set under Beijing’s new measures.\nAlso this year, Australian shipments to China have surged, gaining share at the expense of US beef after Beijing in March allowed permits to expire at hundreds of American meat plants and as Donald Trump unleashed a tit-for-tat tariff war.\nResponding to Beijing’s announcement, Mark Thomas, the chair of the Western Beef Association in Australia, said: “There’s plenty of other countries that will take our product.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/31/australian-beef-industry-extremely-disappointed-after-china-hits-imports-with-55-tariff", "published_at": "2026-01-01T04:48:32+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

We had it in Germany too,” she said.\nAt other Melbourne live sites at the Treasury Gardens, Kings Domain and Docklands, families were enjoying live entertainment before the 9.30pm and midnight fireworks.\nIn Perth, fireworks lit up the sky over the Swan River at 8.30pm before the usual midnight show.\nPartygoers lined the banks of the River Torrens in Adelaide for fireworks in Elder Park.\nIn Brisbane, the 7.45pm fireworks went off along the Brisbane River at 7.45pm amid rainy weather, with a midnight display following.\nFor Tasmanians, there were fireworks over Hobart’s River Derwent at 9.30pm and midnight.\nFireworks were also taking place on the Darwin waterfront with displays at 9pm and midnight.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/31/sydney-new-years-eve-sees-more-sombre-tone-fireworks-follow-minutes-silence-bondi-ntwnfb", "published_at": "2025-12-31T20:36:38+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Finnish coastguard officers boarded the ship at 11am, about six hours after disruption to the cables was first reported. Fourteen crew members, including several Russians, were taken into custody.\nA helicopter sent to investigate reported that the ship was dragging its anchor along the bottom of the seabed. “At this stage, it is still too early to assess whether this was an intentional act or an accident,” Helsinki’s deputy police chief Heikki Kopperoinen told the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat.\nSince Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, some experts and political leaders have viewed the suspected sabotage of cables in the Baltic Sea as part of a hybrid war carried out by Russia against western countries.\nDetectives said they would interrogate the crew, which includes sailors from Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. The vessel, sailing under a flag of convenience from St Vincent and the Grenadines, has been taken to a port near Helsinki.\nEU countries accuse Russia of using dilapidated vessels belonging to a “shadow fleet” to smuggle oil around the world in defiance of western sanctions. The fleet has been linked with previous cases of cable-cutting and with the mysterious appearance of drones in Denmark and Germany.\nIn January, Nato stepped up its naval presence in the area under an operation called Baltic Sentry. It came after Finnish commandos seized another ship, the Eagle S, on Christmas Day 2024 when it damaged critical infrastructure. A court in Helsinki later acquitted its crew on the grounds the incident took place outside Finnish territorial waters.\n“Finland is prepared for security challenges of various kinds, and we respond to them as necessary,” the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, said on X on Wednesday.\nFinland’s deputy prosecutor general, Jukka Rappe, said there were “strong indications of a crime” involving the Fitburg but that it was too soon to reach a conclusion. There was sufficient evidence to open a preliminary investigation, he added.\nThe vessel was in Finland’s exclusive economic zone when it was located by a border guard patrol boat and helicopter. Its anchor chain was found to be lowered into the sea, police said. Finnish police said they were investigating “aggravated criminal damage, attempted aggravated criminal damage, and aggravated interference with telecommunications”.\nThe damaged cables were in the Gulf of Finland between Finland and Estonia. One belonged to the Finnish telecommunications operator Elisa and the other, according to Estonia, was owned by the Swedish provider Arelion. Services were routed via other cables.\nWednesday’s incident came as Russia launched a large-scale drone attack on the Ukrainian port city of Odesa. Six people were injured, including children, with four blocks of flats hit. Two energy facilities sustained significant damage, the power company DTEK said.\nRussia has been systematically targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, leaving civilians without heat and light in freezing winter conditions. More than 170,000 people had no electricity after the Odesa attack, Ukraine’s energy ministry said. The Kyiv region is also experiencing severe blackouts.\nMeanwhile, the defence ministry in Moscow released video footage that it said was of a crashed drone that was on its way on Sunday to Vladimir Putin’s presidential palace in the Novgorod region. Russia claims Ukraine carried out a major attack with 91 drones.\nThe story has been widely debunked. On Wednesday Ukraine’s foreign ministry dismissed the video three days after the event as “laughable”, Reuters reported, and said Kyiv was “absolutely confident” the attack did not happen. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, dismissed the report as “unfounded”.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/31/finnish-police-seize-vessel-suspected-damaging-underwater-cable", "published_at": "2025-12-31T16:52:04+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Six-hour waits were ongoing in Calais but passengers were advised to check in as planned.\nOn Tuesday, Eurostar staff at St Pancras station in central London were seen handing out water bottles to people waiting by a cordon who were caught up in the delays. Meanwhile, cars hoping to cross the Eurotunnel caused traffic jams on the approach to the Folkestone terminal.\nMeanwhile, those caught up in the chaos on Tuesday have described their ordeals. Ghislain Planque told French TV station BFM that his Eurostar journey from London to France was meant to take just under 90 minutes but instead was 11 hours.\nHe said: “We were left without electricity, so with no heating, no air-conditioning, no possibility to charge phones. We were in total darkness for some of the time.”\nTikTok user Eloise De Marco posted a video onboard a stranded Eurostar train with the caption: “When you’ve been stuck on the Eurostar for 10 hours.”\nAnother passenger stuck overnight on a train from London posted on X at 1.28am that there was “no electricity, no toilet, no info”, the Daily Mail reported.\nA French passenger on Tuesday’s 7.01pm train to Paris told the BBC they were stuck onboard the service in London as of 3am and that the crew were “on no sleep” and were dealing with some “angry passengers”.\nA LeShuttle passenger, Tim Brown, told the PA Media news agency he had been stuck in his car on the train at the Calais terminal for more than three hours with “no access to food or water. The fact that nobody has come around offering everybody a bottle of water is what has shocked me the most,” he said. “I know things happen, but surely that would be an easy way to help.”\nEurostar’s site earlier showed that even services on the continent not using the Channel tunnel – such as those between Paris and Brussels – had been cancelled during the day.\nEurostar has held a monopoly on passenger services through the tunnel linking Britain and France since it opened in 1994. The Virgin businessman Richard Branson has vowed to launch a rival service. Italy’s Trenitalia has also said it intends to compete with Eurostar on the Paris-London route by 2029.\nTuesday’s disruption affects Eurostar at a time when the company faces criticism over its high fares, especially between Paris and London.\nAn electrical fault forced the cancellation of Eurostar services and severe delays on others in August. The theft of cables on train tracks in northern France caused two days of problems in June.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/31/eurostar-restarts-channel-tunnel-full-service-but-disruption-risk", "published_at": "2025-12-31T16:02:01+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

But you no longer need to be a multimillionaire to own a Picasso – for €100, anyone in the world has the chance to walk away with a painting by one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.\nThe French charity Alzheimer’s Research Foundation announced recently it was raffling Picasso’s 1941 portrait, Tête de femme, which is worth more than €1m, to a single winner. Proceeds from the tickets will help fund Alzheimer’s research, one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide.\nThe project, entitled “1 Picasso for 100 Euros”, is the first of its kind in the world, and a natural continuation of Picasso’s legacy, according to his grandson Olivier Picasso.\n“My grandfather was very generous, but he was also discreet,” Olivier told the Guardian. “He helped his family, especially my grandmother Marie-Thérèse [Walter]. He helped friends. He helped people in need during the civil war in Spain, during the second world war, and even after, in the 50s and 60s.\n“So for me, this project is an absolutely logical and legitimate part of his legacy. I hope in the future to be able to do this every year if possible.”\nThe raffle is the brainchild of Péri Cochin, a French television producer and owner of the tableware company Waww La Table. Cochin came up with the idea after seeing her mother use them at fundraising events she hosted.\n“I thought, wouldn’t it be great to do a worldwide raffle, by selling tickets online? I decided it should be a piece of art, and what is the most famous name in art? Obviously, it’s Picasso,” she said.\nCochin contacted Olivier Picasso, a childhood friend of hers. When he and the rest of the Picasso administration and the Picasso estate gave their approval, she reserved the 1941 painting from the Opera gallery, which will receive just under €1m after the draw.\n“We are used to hearing about Picasso and these high-priced auctions, but this was the first time where Picasso was really related to a charity,” she said.\nOlivier said the family “had an instant connection with the project”, not least because the money raised is going to a good cause. There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, and no treatment that can stop or reverse its progression. “Now that we are living older than before, we or people around us could be affected by this disease. And I know how difficult and painful it is,” he added.\nThe goal is to sell 120,00 tickets, raising €11m for Alzheimer’s research. The draw is scheduled to take place at Christie’s auction house in Paris on 14 April. If not enough tickets are sold to cover the cost of the painting, all participants will be reimbursed.\nOlivier said Tête de femme was a “very interesting” work that was painted in the same studio in the Left Bank in Paris as Picasso’s 1937 masterpiece Guernica. “The period was important for my grandfather, because he was at the end of a process to divorce his first wife, Olga Khokhlova – a divorce that never happened because Franco abolished the divorce law [in 1939], despite meeting my grandmother and Dora Maar.\n“The period was also very complicated because of the occupation of Paris by the Nazis. And so the colours are darker than usual, with brown, black, and grey. While it’s a beautiful depiction of a woman, there is still the ambience of Picasso. My grandfather kept the painting as a souvenir of the moment.”\nCochin has organised two previous raffles for Picasso paintings, in 2013 and 2020, raising a total of more than €10m. The first winner was 25-year-old Jeffrey Gonano, who became the owner of a Picasso drawing valued at €860,000. “He put the painting in the Museum of Pittsburg for a while, and now it’s in storage at Christie’s in New York, because he didn’t want to keep it at home,” she said.\nThe second winner was Claudia Borgogno, an accountant from Ventimiglia, Italy, whose son had given her a raffle ticket for Christmas. She became the owner of a 1921 Picasso valued at €1m.\n“She still has the painting, she said it would change her life. It’s a really beautiful story,” Cochin added.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/dec/31/picasso-portrait-charity-auction-alzheimers", "published_at": "2025-12-31T15:00:12+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

It makes it a no-go area for people.”\nFrank McDonald, who writes about urban planning for the Irish Times, recalled how he moved into the area in 1995, full of optimism, but fled in 2022 amid hordes of pub-crawlers and thumping nightclub music. “I feared that our home would become uninhabitable,” he wrote in July.\nSince then, there have been more grim headlines, including the alleged mugging of a visiting NFL quarterback and an assault on an English tourist who later died. A study of online reviews rated Temple Bar the world’s third biggest tourist trap, reinforcing the perception of a raucous, brawling district best left to stag parties.\nIt adds up to a crushing indictment of the original vision: instead of art and culture, crime and overpriced Guinness.\nThere is, however, an alternative view that Temple Bar is a victim of outdated stereotyping and that a renaissance is under way, making the area a vibrant and a worthy home for organisations such as the Irish Film Institute, Project Arts Centre, Smock Alley Theatre and Graphic Studio Gallery.\n“It is Dublin’s cultural quarter,” said Martin Harte, the chief executive officer of the Temple Bar Company, a business association. “The era of massive drinking – it’s not that now. Temple Bar is an entirely different place. It’s the front room of Dublin city.”\nViolent incidents garnered publicity but set against an annualised footfall of 24m visits they were very rare, said Harte. “To say Temple Bar is unsafe is not accurate. Walk around, it has everything from small art galleries to coffee shops, tattoo parlours, vintage clothes shops, hotels. It’s where people come, it gives it that electricity.”\nTom Roo, 39, and Heather Mitchell, 28, a couple from Leeds, agreed. “I was expecting young lads and drinking everywhere but it’s really nice to walk around, it’s relaxed,” said Roo. Mitchell found the pubs picturesque – more so even than their images on Instagram.\nIn the 1980s, much of this web of lanes and streets was derelict and due to become a bus terminus. Instead, in 1991 the government decided to channel Dublin’s year as European city of culture into a showcase project driven by a state agency and tax incentives. Renovated historic buildings and new contemporary structures and art installations created a landmark in urban renewal.\nThe decade also brought cheap flights, laddish culture and superpubs that turned Temple Bar into a boozing destination. “That’s where it got its initial stripes, its brand,” said Harte. “You had to queue behind 30, 40 people to get in anywhere to have a drink.”\nThe supposed culture hub was nicknamed the Temple of Bars and likened to Ibiza. Bacchanalia continued through the 2008 economic crash and prompted another judge – ruling in a 2017 assault case – to brand Temple Bar a vomit-splattered “disgrace to Ireland”.\nThe Covid pandemic brought more challenges. Gangs marauded through under-policed streets, stealing and vandalising. “All the zombies came out,” said Ángel Luis González, director of PhotoIreland, which runs exhibitions and a bookshop called The Library Project.\nHowever, improved policing has restored safety, confidence and an eclectic vibe, said González, echoing a widespread view among stakeholders. People who come to take selfies outside famous pubs end up visiting galleries and discovering artists.\nJohn Cullen, who runs a jewellery shop and stall in a refurbished square, said the outdoor market drew in families with children. “It civilises the place.”\nPubs such as the Palace, Gogarty’s and the Norseman still drew big crowds but the number of late night licences – which allow venues to serve alcohol until 3am – had plunged from 25 to seven and fine dining was making inroads, said Harte. “Every single pub now serves food. People are still drinking but nowhere near at the old levels.”\nWill Wollen, who moved to Temple Bar two years ago to run the Gaiety School of Acting, said the area’s reputation for excess was unfair. “There is an energy but it’s not a hen party hellscape. It’s a pub culture with warmth and friendliness.”\nStephen Kennedy, who runs the Copper and Straw cafe and chairs the Aston Quay and Temple Bar Business and Residents’ Alliance, said there were plans for more street art, seating, lighting and perhaps an outdoor cinema. “I would tell any tourist coming to Dublin that Temple Bar is a must.”\nOther Dubliners, in contrast, urge visitors to steer clear unless they like crowds, price gouging and ersatz Irishness. Critics also accuse platforms such as Airbnb of driving up rents and driving out people.\nPerry Share, a sociologist and co-editor of a book on Irish pubs, said Temple Bar was a “pub theme park” that offered a degree of authenticity. “Tourists come to replicate an Irish pub experience they have perhaps seen online. The music and drink is essential to that.”\nA vox pop of early evening drinkers last week yielded toasts to Temple Bar. “TikTok said it was too touristy but the buzz is great,” said Tom Salter, 22, from London. Dave Howard, from Derbyshire, had a caveat. “It can be quite fun watching a stag party. But not for the locals, obviously.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/31/dublin-temple-bar-renaissance-not-hen-party-hellscape", "published_at": "2025-12-31T11:00:09+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The Israeli government says entry of these items must be severely restricted because they could be exploited by Hamas or other armed groups for military ends.\nHowever, for at least a month, Israeli authorities have allowed businesses to transport multiple dual-use items into Gaza, including generators and metal pallets, which are more durable in winter rains and mud than wooden alternatives.\nThese are now on sale in the open market in Gaza, according to military, diplomatic and humanitarian sources. They must pass through the same three tightly controlled Israeli checkpoints that currently bar shipments of these goods for aid organisations.\n“It seems highly improbable that the Israelis don’t know about them,” said one diplomatic source. “It’s very shocking that these things are able to enter through commercial channels.”\nThe disparity limits the work of humanitarian organisations supporting Palestinians at a time of desperate need, while providing lucrative opportunities to commercial traders who can secure import permits from Israeli authorities.\nThe American commander of a new US base in southern Israel has been briefed on such dual-use restrictions. Lt Gen Patrick Frank has discussed the controls with diplomats and humanitarians at the Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC), which was established in October to monitor the Donald Trump-brokered ceasefire and plan for Gaza’s future. His views on the matter are not known.\nIsrael has a long track record of exploiting access to Gaza to further its political goals, said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli human rights group that has been monitoring controls for 20 years.\n“On the surface the private sector [shipments of items on the dual-use list] can appear to be very confusing and an inconsistency,” she said. “But I see it as very consistent with their policy of trying to strengthen the hand of certain actors and weaken the hand of others.”\nEntry controls on items such as generators did not reflect “the inherent risk or danger of the item itself”, she said. “It’s a question of: whose hands is it in? Where is it? How is it being used?”\nIsraeli restrictions have long made trade into Gaza particularly lucrative for those Palestinians and Israelis who can secure permits. Items on the dual-use list now sell for huge premiums inside Gaza.\n“The only way to get a generator right now is on the private sector,” said Sam Rose, acting director for Gaza for Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. “There’s a mark up on that.”\n“My understanding is that it is the business interests on all sides – Israeli, Egyptian, Palestinian – with some of the security companies that enjoy Israeli protection also taking a cut alongside other criminal elements, all in all supporting the growth of an illegal economy,” Rose added. “What’s not clear to me is whether Hamas is getting a cut. I would assume so but have not seen any confirmation of this.”\nAhmed Alkhatib, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that when it came to commercial deliveries into Gaza, “You’re not just paying fees and taxes to Hamas in Gaza, you’re paying fees and taxes to merchants on the Israeli side. We all know that Gaza was and will always be a massive market for the Israeli economy.”\nCogat, the Israeli defence ministry unit that controls access to Gaza, denied “preventing or delaying” aid shipments into Gaza or applying looser restrictions for commercial traders.\n“The policy governing the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip is approved by the political echelon in Israel and implemented by Cogat in a uniform manner vis-a-vis the UN, international organisations, donor countries, and the private sector,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\nFor dual-use items, Israel “offers international organisations alternatives that allow and facilitate a humanitarian response”, the statement said, without providing any details. Spokesperson Shimi Zuaretz also said medical aid organisations had been given permits to bring generators into Gaza “over the last month”.\nThe Israeli military referred questions about aid shipments into Gaza to Cogat. The US military declined to comment.\nThe shipment controls are the latest instance of Israel weaponising aid for political and military goals in Gaza. Over the summer Israel caused a famine in parts of the territory by blocking food shipments for weeks, then allowing only a trickle of aid to enter, killing hundreds of people.\nIsrael this week told 37 NGOs active in Gaza they would have to cease all operations within 60 days, unless they hand over detailed information on their Palestinian staff.\nDiplomats and humanitarian officials have said that stopping the work of the NGOs listed would have catastrophic consequences and put Palestinian lives at risk.\n“The EU has been clear: the NGO registration law cannot be implemented in its current form,” the EU humanitarian chief, Hadja Lahbib, posted on social media. “IHL [international humanitarian law] leaves no room for doubt: aid must reach those in need.”\n“The reality is that the commercial sector can bring in what it wants [now],” said Rose. “Items not approved for humanitarian organisations, such as generators, are available commercially. So we have a two-tier system, which is undermining the UN-led system, which Israel is required to support as per international law.”\nUS forces deployed to the CMCC arrived in October prepared to launch a major logistics effort to get aid supplies into Gaza.\nThey were surprised and confused to find the biggest challenge was political, and began clashing with Israeli counterparts over some of the restrictions almost immediately, said multiple sources briefed on meetings at the base.\nAn early confrontation was over tent poles. Shelter is a critical need as winter sets in because Israeli attacks have destroyed nine out of 10 Palestinian homes, but Israel deems metal tent poles needed for sturdy winter-proof tents “dual use”.\nUS officers at the CMCC rapidly drew up a list of at least a dozen key humanitarian items they wanted removed from the dual-use list, with tent poles near the top. Weeks later Israel has not lifted restrictions on any of them.\n“It is clearly not security interests that are driving decision-making here,” said one western source. “The dual-use list is just another way to control what enters Gaza.”\nRestrictions on the type and quantity of goods allowed into Gaza long preceded the current war. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from the territory in 2005 but maintained effective control of the borders and used that to impose a blockade.\n“It has always been a form of control over the wellbeing of the population,” said the Gisha director, Hary. “Whether that’s the bare minimum of humanitarian standards we are looking at now, or in previous years in terms of economic life, construction, industry, development in technology and agriculture and innovation.”\nThe dual-use list, which requires a security assessment and permits to import items to Gaza, has been a particular concern since it was introduced.\nIt is sweeping in its scope, secret until an item is rejected and has been imposed arbitrarily. Older versions obtained by Gisha through legal action include categories such as “communications equipment” – so broad it could cover most modern electronics.\nItems barred on dual-use grounds over the last two years include solar panels, smoke detectors, crutches, wheelchairs and walkers.\nAid groups have collaborated to compile an unofficial list of rejected items in an effort to limit the amount of time and money spent applying to import things that are unlikely to get approval. But it is time consuming.\nInternational pressure on Israel over the dual-use list has also flagged over the last two years, and even with the creation of the CMCC.\nDiplomats are concerned about spiralling violence in the West Bank and uncertainty about long-term plans for Gaza’s reconstruction, as aid groups are negotiating possible de-registration by Israel.\nThe dual-use list is not the only bureaucratic obstacle limiting the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Some items are banned because Israel has decided they don’t address urgent humanitarian needs.\nThis category includes paper and pencils to restart schools after two years without education for 600,000 children, and frozen beef and mutton to feed a malnourished population. Aid organisations have been limited to chicken while commercial traders have been able to bring in all kinds of meat.\nThe limited number of crossings into Gaza and their hours of operation, as well as delays approving routes for convoys inside the territory – which is vital to ensuring they do not come under Israeli attack – all serve to slow the entry of vital supplies.\nOverall flows of aid into Gaza are well below levels agreed under the ceasefire, data provided by the Israeli military and analysed by the Associated Press showed.\nFood shipments have increased enough to stave off famine, but hunger is still widespread, UN-backed food security experts said last week. About 1.6 million people were expected to face “crisis” levels of hunger in the next four months and if the ceasefire broke down, the territory could slip back into famine.\nWinter weather and lack of shelter are exacerbating the impact of long-term malnutrition, particularly on young children. At least three have been killed by hypothermia this month, the UN said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/01/israel-allowing-traders-to-bring-into-gaza-dual-use-items-barred-from-aid-organisations", "published_at": "2026-01-01T08:00:35+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

He closed his shop and took to the streets, joining merchants across Iran who shuttered their stores and students who took over their campuses to protest against declining economic conditions.\nThe sudden loss of purchasing power pushed Alborz and tens of thousands of other Iranians into the streets, where protests are now entering their fourth day. Students have paralysed university campuses, traders have shut down their stores and demonstrators have blocked off streets in defiance of police. Protests have spread from the capital, Tehran, to cities across Iran.\nDespite the risk of being jailed for his political activism, the father of four had run out of options. On Sunday, the national currency plunged to a historic low, putting further pressure on Alborz, who was already struggling to provide for his family.\n“What will my children eat? Do we have to bring suitcases of cash to simply buy bread? Do you find that normal?” Alborz told the Guardian over the phone, speaking under a pseudonym for fear of security reprisals.\nThe unprecedented depreciation of the national currency on Sunday – when the Iranian rial dropped to 1.42m to the US dollar, a more than 56% decrease in value in six months – was a breaking point for an already struggling economy and population. The plunging currency has caused soaring inflation, with food prices up by 72% on average compared with the same time last year.\nIran is also under some of the world’s most intense sanctions, which have spurred inflation as the country struggles to access frozen funds abroad and foreign exchange, something exacerbated by its growing reliance on imports.\nThe protests are the largest in Iran since 2022, when Iranians erupted in anger at the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after being arrested for not wearing her hijab properly. Those protests were violently quashed and ultimately simmered out.\nSocial media in Iran has been filled with videos of protesters chanting anti-government slogans and throwing stones at security forces. In one video from Tehran, a lone man sits blocking the way of security services on motorbikes as crowds of protesters flee from teargas.\nThough the protests started as demonstrations against deteriorating living conditions, they have widened to express grievances at the way Iran is being governed. Women’s rights activists, shopkeepers and students have begun chanting “death to the dictator” and “woman, life, freedom” – slogans that could put people in prison.\nAlborz said: “For years now, we have slowly but surely made significant changes to our lifestyles because of this corrupt government. This was the last nail in the coffin. We wanted this regime gone and now there’s no way this regime will continue.”\nThe government, still shaken from a brutal 12-day war with Israel in June which rocked the foundations of the Iranian regime, has called for dialogue with protest leaders. Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said the government should listen to the “legitimate demands” of protesters.\nBut they are wary of the offer, believing it to be an attempt to co-opt their demands and kill the momentum of the rare protest movement.\n“You must be naive to think Iranians trust this government or the regime,” said Farhad, a 19-year-old university student active in the protest movement who spoke under a pseudonym.\nHe and other students described how security services had confiscated student IDs and beaten and arrested some protesters. A protester in Tehran sent the Guardian a picture of a metal pellet, which they said was shot at them by security forces. The Guardian could not independently verify the claim of the protester.\n“If the administration wanted to talk, they wouldn’t fire teargas, shoot at protesters and if dialogue is what they wanted, they would not have executed protesters in 2023. There is no willingness from any of us to talk to them, we want the mullahs gone and we want democracy,” Farhad added.\nAs the Iranian government dealt with protests at home, it was also facing threats from abroad.\nOn Monday, the US president, Donald Trump, flirted with the idea of striking Iran again, suggesting there could be renewed nuclear activity in Iran – telling reporters if there was, “we’ll knock them down”. Iran has rejected claims it is enriching uranium and has said its nuclear programme is peaceful.\nOn Monday, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said in a statement it would confront any “sedition, unrest” or security threats.\nThe IRGC said: “Enemies are seeking to sow the seeds of sedition within Iranian society through cognitive warfare, psychological operations, falsified narratives, fear-mongering and encouragement of capitulation to them.”\nDespite intimidation from authorities, protesters said they were not cowed. They expected trade unions to soon join the merchants in striking.\n“Yesterday, we blocked roads and stopped the security forces from advancing. People sat on the roads and chanted that they could kill us, but we wouldn’t let them pass. We are not going to open shops until the regime weakens further,” said Alborz.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/31/we-want-the-mullahs-gone-economic-crisis-sparks-biggest-protests-in-iran-since-2022", "published_at": "2025-12-31T19:13:04+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Successive UK governments campaigned for his release.\nIn the days since Abd el-Fattah’s return, social media comments have surfaced – dating back to 2010 – in which he said Zionists, colonialists and police officers should be killed and British people were “dogs and monkeys”.\nEarlier this week, he apologised “unequivocally” for his tweets. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, who initially said he was “delighted” by the activist’s arrival back in the UK, has since condemned the tweets and said he was unaware of them.\nThe Conservatives and Reform UK have both suggested Abd el-Fattah should be deported from the UK and have his British citizenship revoked.\nOn Wednesday the shadow home secretary, Robert Jenrick, who has led calls for Abd el-Fattah’s British citizenship to be revoked and for him to be deported, highlighted social media posts reportedly from an account belonging to his sister, Mona Seif, in which she referred to the “imagination” of Hamas in its deadly attack on Israel in October 2023.\nThe post said images of Hamas militants flying into Israel by paraglider were like “something out of a sci-fi movie”, adding: “I guess it takes a special kind of imagination to find new ways of resisting an extremely advanced occupation army whose war crimes are constantly justified and endorsed by some of the most powerful governments!”\nThe comment was posted on X at 10.57am on 7 October 2023. Twenty-one minutes later, another post said: “Once again the discrepancy between many of those celebrating Ukrainian resistance but now condemn Palestinian resistance, speaks loudly of their hypocrisy.\n“You are either with people’s right to resist an army occupation or not! It can’t be ‘only for people who look like me’.”\nIn other comments uncovered this week, Abd el-Fattah asked in 2011 “who would weep if we killed Osama Saraya?”, referring to the editor of an Egyptian newspaper that had backed Hosni Mubarak, the dictator who was swept from power in the Arab spring.\nIn a 2010 tweet, Abd el-Fattah appeared to joke about a “suicide bombing taking a few zionists’ lives”.\nCooper has launched a review into “serious information failures” in the Abd el-Fattah case.\nGovernment sources say the Home Office will not strip him of his citizenship because his past social media posts do not meet the legal bar for such a sanction.\nHuman rights campaigners have said such a punishment would be an “extremely authoritarian step”.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/31/emily-thornberry-government-accused-failures-abd-el-fattah-case", "published_at": "2025-12-31T18:53:15+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

By contrast, ethnic minorities only made up to 5.3% of the populationin ICBs with a higher than average prescribing rate.\nAbout 5.8 million people across the UK live with diabetes, while people from black and south Asian backgrounds in particular are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes by the age of 25.\nSamuel Seidu, the lead author and a professor in primary care diabetes and cardio-metabolic medicine at the University of Leicester, said the study was the “first national analysis in England to demonstrate, with robust prescribing data, that significant ethnic inequalities exist in access to continuous glucose monitoring across both type 1 and type 2 diabetes”.\nHe added: “The disparity is not entirely surprising, although it is concerning as previous research internationally (especially in the US) has repeatedly shown lower adoption of diabetes technologies in minority ethnic groups.\n“In the UK, minority groups already experience higher diabetes prevalence and worse cardiometabolic outcomes, suggesting structural inequities in care access. Ethnicity and deprivation together account for up to 77% of variance in CGM prescribing in type 2 diabetes, meaning structural inequities are deeply embedded.”\nAccording to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidelines, all adults with type 1 and 2 diabetes should have access to diabetes technology, including a CGM device. However, the study shows that these guidelines are not being implemented consistently across all areas of England.\nAnthony Walker, policy lead at Diabetes UK, said the research revealed “the very real inequities” that exist in access to life-changing tech.\nHe said: “Actively raising awareness among underserved communities is crucial. Healthcare professionals must also be supported to identify where the gaps in access are and have the tools to develop targeted interventions to address them.\n“It is vital that Nice’s guidelines are adopted consistently, so that everyone who could stand to benefit from this transformative technology can access it.”\nPrevious reporting by the Guardian found that many families from deprived backgrounds were unable to make the most of NHS-provided diabetes technology because they were unable to afford smartphones, which can make managing type 1 diabetes, especially among small children, more manageable.\nDaniel Newman, a diabetes advocate who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a child, said: “I’ve been advocating for access to CGMs for people living with diabetes for many years. I myself had to move my diabetes care to a different hospital to get access to the tech I knew I was entitled to.\n“Access to CGMs should be based on clinical need, not determined by postcode, ethnicity or income. It’s troubling to know that the communities most affected by type 2 diabetes are the least likely to receive this technology. We must confront the systemic barriers that deny people the tools they need to live well – and ensure that Nice guidance is not just acknowledged, but actively implemented for everyone who qualifies.”\nNHS England have been approached for comment.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/01/ethnic-minorities-in-england-less-likely-to-have-access-to-diabetes-tech-study", "published_at": "2026-01-01T07:00:33+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

It was a tranquil scene in this tucked-away corner of the English West Country but tyre tracks cutting through the crop were a sign of the violence that takes place when night falls.\nThis is one of the hotspots in Wiltshire for hare coursing, in which criminal gangs set dogs – usually greyhounds or lurchers – on the mammals.\nTypically, bets are placed on how many “turns” it will take for the hound to catch and kill a hare, with some chases livestreamed so that gamblers across the world can take part.\nWiltshire police, one of the UK police forces leading the fight against the coursers, say hare coursing gangs are terrorising the countryside. “I fear it’s only a matter of time before a farmer or landowner here is seriously injured defending their property,” said Insp Andy Lemon, the tactical lead for rural crime in Wiltshire.\nHe cautioned against farmers “taking matters into their own hands and hitting back”, saying: “We tell them: please don’t – call us. But the concern is that a farmer will lose it.”\nOver the past year, hare coursing and poaching offences rose by more than 20% in Wiltshire. Since January 2025, 30 people have been arrested over the offences – a 500% increase compared with 2024.\nBut many more are not caught. Gang members travel from across the UK to Wiltshire, which offers particularly good country for the crime as once the autumn harvest is complete, expanses of open fields are exposed, leaving the hares little cover.\n“This is their playground,” said Lemon, who took the Guardian out to see some of the spots favoured by the coursers. “We think hare coursing is probably taking place somewhere in the county every day.”\nThe areas the coursers like tend to be crisscrossed by paths, bridleways and byways, making good spots accessible to determined criminals with four-wheel drive vehicles.\nIf they can get there in time, the force sends armed officers, drone operators and road traffic teams, but the offenders are good at slipping away. “When they go off road, it can be like looking for a needle in a haystack,” said Lemon.\nHe suggested that while forces such as Wiltshire and Lincolnshire were actively tackling the coursers, the crime was taking place wherever there were hares. “Some police forces say they don’t have a problem. I think they do – they just don’t know about it.”\nOne Vale of Pewsey farmer showed the Guardian the defences landowners were putting in place to try to keep the coursers away, including troughs filled with concrete and fallen trees placed across field gates. “But they find their way in,” he said.\n“They smash through gates and fences. They don’t care and in fact I think they get a kick out of being chased and getting away. There’s big money involved. They bet thousands of pounds and the dogs are worth tens of thousands. This is a crisis for us.”\nAnother local farmer said his land was used for coursing 10 times in one month. “We’ve spent an absolute fortune on ditching and fencing, extra CCTV and lighting,” he said. “Every single night, I go out and drive the perimeter of the farm to make sure gates are still locked and fences are still up and there are no lights where there shouldn’t be lights. My wife has a bit of a moment every time I leave.”\nThere have been some nasty incidents. One Wiltshire farm worker suffered leg and hand injuries when he was knocked to the ground by a car after confronting suspected hare coursers.\nA barn was set alight after one farmer chased off coursers and three cows were killed in a road accident after fencing was destroyed by suspected coursers as they accessed a field.\nA video was circulated – by coursers, apparently as a warning shot – of a farmer being surrounded at night by vehicles in his field. They circled him and rammed his car.\nAnother Vale of Pewsey farmer said the success of conservation work to improve conditions for hares was one reason the crime was on the rise. “There’s been a rise in the number of hares – and with that has come an increase in hare coursing,” she said. “I’ve heard of some farmers thinking of shooting hares to stop hare coursing, which is so sad.”\nPhilip Wilkinson, the police and crime commissioner for Wiltshire and Swindon and a board member of the National Rural Crime Network, said: “We’re being hammered, terrorised.”\nWilkinson, who served in the British army for 32 years, is determined to clamp down on the coursers. “We will send out armed response teams, traffic [officers] – anybody. We’ll pile in to try and catch the buggers.”\nHe said hare coursers were enmeshed in international criminal networks. He had watched coursing being livestreamed into China and had seen intelligence that many involved in the activity were also responsible for the theft of farm equipment, from tools to expensive vehicles, some of which was smuggled to eastern Europe.\n“What we’re seeing is the ends of the tentacles. If you swim upstream through those networks, if you go far enough, you get to China and eastern Europe. It’s all overlapped and linked.”\nFrequently, those who defy coursers find animal corpses dumped close to their homes or businesses. “A line of dead hares was put across the end of my lane,” said Wilkinson. “They’re sticking two fingers up at us.”\nBut the impact is not just economic. It is a cruel sport to the hares and to some of the dogs. “You’re essentially testing the fitness of your dog against the fitness of a wild animal, the hare,” said David Bowles, the RSPCA’s head of public affairs. “And the end result is inevitably that the dog catches the hare and rips it to bits.”\nHare coursing was outlawed in the Hunting Act 2004 and the ban has been stiffened recently with stronger sentences and more powers to seize dogs.\nBowles said police forces such as in Wiltshire and Lincolnshire were working with organisations such as the RSPCA, the National Farmers’ Union and the Countryside Alliance. “I think you’re starting to see the first signs of the crackdown actually starting to work during 2025,” he said.\nWiltshire council said it had seen an increase in the number of dogs associated with hare coursing that were being abandoned. In a three-month period in 2025, it collected 20 lurcher-type dogs. Some were underweight and injured, while only three were claimed by owners.\nShortly after Lemon left the Vale of Pewsey on his way back to police headquarters in Devizes, his radio crackled. Dogs had been found in a car on Salisbury Plain. “Probably hare coursing,” he said. The daily hunt for the coursers was beginning again.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/01/on-trail-of-hare-coursers-in-wiltshire-coursing", "published_at": "2026-01-01T06:00:32+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

And then you think, actually, we should do things in a more moral way. I think it’s going to become a more moral period.\n“Humans are very weird in the way they think the past was always some better place. In fact, today is pretty good and tomorrow is going to be even better.\n“People are basically good. Fundamentally, the instincts of humans are those of tribal primates. We like to look after each other. We like to be gentle. We really adore laughing. And we only tend to be at our roughest when resources get less.”\nEden opened in 2001, with an aim to explore humans’ place in nature. The growing climate emergency was talked about but was not at the top of the agenda.\nSmit said: “The main inspiration was that most people didn’t realise that without plants there’s no life on earth. Effectively, the Eden Project is a monument to the importance of plants.”\nHe said the “holy grail” at Eden was to create a “narrative arc” that made humans see the natural world as something to which they really belonged. “So if they damage the natural world, they damage themselves.”\nSmit said the situation was perilous. “Our winters are getting wetter our summers are getting more arid. We know just a small amount of climate tipping may create things we can’t control. Our consumer culture is incredibly damaging to our ability to forward plan.\n“We’re not conserving our water; we’re allowing people to poison our water. The privatisation of water was a complete mistake. It was to do with the dogma of ownership rather than the best use of things for the civic good.”\nBut he said there was hope, including from the world of plants such as advances in the understanding of mycelium: the thread-like network that forms the bulk of a fungus, which can be grown into building materials and clean up contaminated environments.\nAbout 25 million people have visited Eden, not only to walk around its rainforest biome but to attend everything from gigs – next year’s lineup includes the Pixies and Becky Hill – to community events.\n“I’ve always believed that gathering groups of people together is good,” Smit said. “It’s a spiritual experience with a small ‘s’. It’s special, hopeful.”\nSmit said that as an island nation one of the things vital for Britain was reliable energy.\nHe said: “I find it utterly crazy there’s no British vision to become completely energy-independent. If you’ve got energy independence, there is nothing you cannot grow. And if there’s nothing you cannot grow, it means you’ve got two of the major planks – food and energy – under the control of your island nation. No matter what poverty you got into borrowing, you can feed yourself and rebuild and regenerate.”\nSmit was criticised in 2022 for suggesting that Cornish people are not articulate and are over fond of looking back to imaginary “good old days”. Another of his schemes, to build an education centre for horticulture, agronomy and cookery on a hillside above the Cornish town of Lostwithiel attracted fierce protests and was rejected by councillors.\nBut Eden has brought many millions into the Cornish economy. The organisation put the figure at £2.2bn in 2019 and will give an updated total in the new year, which it says is much bigger.\nThere are plans to build new Edens on the seafront at Morecambe in Lancashire and in Dundee, Scotland. An “Oriental Eden” is open in Qingdao, eastern China.\nSmit admitted that when Eden first opened its doors he resented the public coming in. “It had been our baby at the time. Now, I feel happy. I think it’s beautiful.\n“The real magic of the natural world is the plants have adapted and created the same leaf structures they would in the rainforest, which shows there’s a pattern, there’s a system going on. Nature knows a thing or two but the absolute joy of the Eden Project is that young people who come here feel it gives them permission to dream.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/jan/01/eden-project-25-anniversary-founder-tim-smit", "published_at": "2026-01-01T05:00:30+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

However, not a single one of the main childhood vaccines in England hit the target in 2024-25. There were also sharp differences in uptake across the country.\nIn an effort to tackle the crisis, health visitors will begin offering a range of life-saving jabs to children in their own homes as part of a £2m pilot scheme starting in January.\nHealth visitors are nurses or midwives that specialise in working with families with children under five to identify health needs as early as possible. Under the scheme, they will target families who are not signed up with a GP or who struggle with travel costs, childcare, language barriers or other issues stopping them seeing a doctor.\nChildren will be identified by the NHS using GP records, health visitor notes and local databases, sources said. Health visitors will be trained to administer vaccines safely and have tricky conversations with parents, including those with doubts about vaccine safety.\nTwelve pilot areas will launch in January across five regions of England – London, the Midlands, the north-east and Yorkshire, the north-west and the south-west – aimed at boosting uptake and protecting children against diseases. If successful, the scheme will roll out everywhere in 2027.\nWes Streeting, the health secretary, said: “Every parent deserves the chance to protect their child from preventable diseases, but some families have a lot going on and that can mean they miss out.\n“Health visitors are already trusted faces in communities across the country. By allowing them to offer vaccinations, we’re using the relationships and expertise that already exist to reach families who need support most.\n“Fixing the NHS means tackling health inequalities head-on. By meeting families where they are, we’re not just boosting vaccination rates – we’re building a health service that works for everyone.”\nThe child vaccine drive comes as the NHS remains under “extraordinary pressure” amid high rates of flu and other winter bugs. Health leaders are braced for a surge in cases in the next few days as temperatures plummet.\nHalf a million more people in England have had the flu jab compared with the previous year. But health officials said on Wednesday it was not too late for unvaccinated people to protect themselves for the rest of winter.\nThe move to send health visitors with vaccines direct to children’s homes comes amid serious concern about uptake in England.\nOnly 91.9% of five-year-olds received one dose of the MMR (measles, mumps & rubella) vaccine in 2024-25, the lowest level since 2010-11, according to UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data reviewed by the Guardian.\nJust 83.7% of five-year-olds had received both MMR doses, down year-on-year from 83.9% and the lowest level since 2009-10. Uptake of the first MMR dose at 24 months stood at 88.9% in 2024-25 – again the lowest figure since 2009-10.\nIn July a child died in Liverpool after contracting measles, the first such death in the UK in a decade. Only 73% of children in Liverpool have received the necessary two shots to protect against measles.\nThe UK is the worst of the G7 nations regarding MMR vaccination uptake, according to the WHO: as of 2024 only 89% of children had received their first MMR jab. Globally, millions of children are at risk of lethal diseases owing to vaccine coverage having stalled or reversed, according to the largest study of its kind.\nCoverage for the Hib/MenC vaccine, which protects against Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningitis C, stood at 88.9% for five-year-olds in England, the lowest level since 2011-12.\nMeanwhile, uptake of the four-in-one preschool booster vaccine – which protects against polio, whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria – was just 81.4% among five-year-olds in 2024-25.\nIt means about one in five are unprotected when starting primary school, and represents the worst uptake since current records began in 2009-10.\nFrom Friday, a vaccine for chickenpox will be rolled out on the NHS across England.\nThe jab, which costs about £150 at private clinics and pharmacies, will form part of a new combined immunisation on the childhood vaccination programme.\nMinisters hope it will not only protect some youngsters from severe complications from the virus, but also prevent parents taking time off work to look after their children if they become infected.\nThe chickenpox vaccine – also known as the varicella jab – will form part of a new combined MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella and varicella) vaccine.\nIt will be offered at GP practices from Friday, and is expected to offer protection to about 500,000 children every year. The MMRV will eventually replace the MMR, which is offered to babies at 12 months and 18 months.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/01/children-in-england-to-be-offered-vaccines-in-their-own-homes", "published_at": "2026-01-01T00:01:24+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Thriller writer Harriet Tyce, 52, who is also a former criminal barrister, admits her CV has given her “the skill set that could be quite useful”.\nHer previous books include Lessons in Cruelty and the appropriately titled The Lies You Told.\n“I spend my life making up horrible ways for people to die and killing people on the page,” she said.\n“The idea that I might get to actually plot to kill people or to track down a murderer, but, you know, without actual blood being shed, it’s the closest that I’d get to that experience in real life. So quite honestly, what’s not to like?\n“I’m really good at putting clues together, but I say all of this and I could collapse into a puddle of angst and it might be a complete disaster.”\nDespite her experience in treachery and misdirection, she said her plan is to play down her skills as a novelist and “dial up” her role as a housewife and mother, to keep the heat off her early on. “I’m not going to be dishonest,” she said. “I’m just going to play it down.”\nAccompanying her within the Scottish castle that hosts the show will be Amanda, a 57-year-old retired police detective from Brighton, who spent a career uncovering deceit and observing shady behaviour.\n“I’ve done lots of interviews with criminals and victims. You have to put the pieces together to find the truth and see through the lies,” she said.\n“To be a traitor, you have to be good at lying, have a good poker face and be a master of deflection to prevent you being identified. I’ve learned a lot about being deceptive, devious and cunning.”\nAnother contestant, Ellie, 33, is thought to be the first psychologist on the show. She said she hoped to bring a “psychological perspective” to the infamous roundtable discussions, after which a contestant is voted out of the game.\nShe said she was hoping to deploy those skills as a traitor – with a tactic of winning over friends early on.\n“It’s absolutely about trying to form bonds with people early on, because we know that voting around the round table isn’t just about who’s suspicious, it’s also about the bonds that you’ve made with people,” she said.\n“I am also going to be hiding my occupation as I don’t want people to make assumptions about me.”\nAlso among the hopefuls are Adam, an outspoken builder, James, a poker-playing gardener, and Reece, a 27-year-old sweet shop assistant.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2026/jan/01/new-traitors-contestants-include-detective-writer-psychologist", "published_at": "2026-01-01T00:01:24+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Flynn said he was accepting the “job of a lifetime”.\n“Thank you all so much … and I will see you later,” Mamdani concluded, to audience laughter, before departing up the wide subway stairs where he took the oath, followed by attendees.\nThe ceremony was also attended by the outgoing mayor, Eric Adams, who had held off from a commitment to attending but later said he’d “like to be there to show the smooth, peaceful transition of power”.\nTo honor his Muslim faith, Mamdani was sworn in using a Qur’an, Islam’s holiest book, becoming the first mayor in New York City to do so. He was sworn in at midnight with his hand on his grandfather’s Qur’an and one that belonged to Arturo Schomburg, a Black writer and historian, which was lent to the mayor by the New York public library, according to the New York Times.\nAlso attending were a diverse cast of New Yorkers Mamdani selected for an inaugural committee, including actor John Turturro, playwright Cole Escola and writer Colson Whitehead, as well as advocates, small business owners and campaign workers who the incoming mayor’s office says have “provided perspective, guidance and cultural sensibility” for the ceremony.\nThe midnight ceremony will be followed a 1pm public event at which the new mayor will be introduced by political ally and Bronx Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and sworn in by Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.\nMamdani’s office has said the choice to be sworn in at the old city hall subway station reflected his “commitment to the working people who keep our city running every day”.\n“When Old City Hall Station first opened in 1904 – one of New York’s 28 original subway stations – it was a physical monument to a city that dared to be both beautiful and build great things that would transform working people’s lives,” Mamdani said in a statement.\n“That ambition need not be a memory confined only to our past.”\nThe day’s events are a culmination of a remarkable rise to power in the US’s most populous city, both for a political unknown and for the Democratic Socialist party that Mamdani, elected as a Democrat, represents.\nThe first signs of Mamdani’s electoral potential came earlier in the year, ahead of a primary vote that saw him knock out former governor Andrew Cuomo, who later ran as an independent candidate. Adams, then under the scrutiny of federal prosecutors, chose not to seek the Democratic nomination.\nIn April, Mamdani was trailing Cuomo 36% to 64%. Those numbers shifted after Mamdani’s savvy political campaign took off on social media; his robust grassroots efforts appeared to energize first-time voters struggling with the high cost of living in the post-pandemic city.\nA campaign spokesperson said Mamdani’s success owed to him “being everywhere all of the time”, with more than 10,000 volunteers knocking on more than 100,000 doors, and by pushing out a platform of affordability, rent freezes, free metro transport and city-run grocery stores – as well as the creation of a department of community safety to invest in citywide mental health programs.\nDemocrat campaign veteran Hank Sheinkopf said that Mamdani “represents the city of the future – a more Asian city, a more Muslim city, and what could be a more leftwing city”.\nIn November, the then state assemblyman won the election with 50.78% of the vote, defeating Republican activist Curtis Sliwa and Cuomo. In his victory speech, Mamdani spoke of his commitment to working New Yorkers who did not normally have access to the levers of power.\n“Let the words we’ve spoken together, the dreams we’ve dreamt together, become the agenda we deliver together,” he said. “New York, this power, it’s yours. This city belongs to you.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/01/zohran-mamdani-sworn-in-mayor-new-york-city", "published_at": "2026-01-01T05:15:44+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Boebert, a longtime Maga ally and supporter of the president, said in a statement to a local news station: “I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability.”\nTrump also vetoed a second bill on Tuesday for a project in Florida. The measure aimed to spend $14m to protect an area known as Osceola Camp within Everglades national park that is inhabited by members of the Miccosukee Tribe of Native Americans. The tribe has fought Trump’s makeshift immigrant detention center “Alligator Alcatraz”. A federal judge has now ordered the detention center to be shut down.\nTrump said the tribe was never authorized to inhabit the Osceola Camp area, and that his administration would not support projects for special interests, especially those “unaligned” with his immigration policies.\nTrump’s vetoes were the first two of his second term.\nThe veto of the Colorado bill came after Trump’s vow to retaliate against Colorado for keeping his ally Tina Peters in prison, despite his attempt to pardon her earlier in the month.\nPeters, a former Colorado county clerk, is serving a nine-year prison term after being convicted on state charges for illegally tampering with voting machines in the 2020 presidential election. The charges against Peters were brought under Colorado state law, and so are exempt from a Trump pardon, which can only cover federal charges.\nIt was not immediately clear whether the Republican leaders in Congress would allow a vote to override Trump’s veto in Colorado. Boebert was one of four Republican lawmakers, along with Marjorie Taylor Greene, who played a key role in forcing the release of justice department files on Epstein.

States’ funds will be released “only when states prove they are being spent legitimately”.\nThe report came a day after Jim O’Neill, the HHS deputy secretary, and Alex Adams, an HHS assistant secretary who oversees the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), appeared in a Tuesday evening video message. O’Neill declared that the department had “activated our defend-the-spend system for all ACF childcare payments across America” and would now require “justification, receipt or photo evidence before we make a payment”.\nOriginally, O’Neill and Adams’s message was interpreted as an announcement that HHS would stop childcare funding in Minnesota, not all 50 states. However, the Associated Press reported late Wednesday that the freeze would apply to every state and that all states would need to provide more documentation about their childcare programs before receiving federal money.\nThe department did not immediately reply to a Guardian request for comment to clarify the nature of the freeze, but HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told ABC News that “it’s the onus of the state to make sure that these funds, these federal dollars, taxpayer dollars, are being used for legitimate purposes”.\nRecipients of childcare funding will have to provide HHS with extensive documentation, such as “attendance records, licensing, inspection and monitoring reports, complaints and investigations”, Nixon added.\nThe changes to US childcare services as part of a response to a viral video, made by a self-described “independent journalist” and rightwing influencer, that purported to discover massive fraud at daycare centers operated by Somali Americans in Minneapolis.\nHowever, other news outlets have not been able to verify the claims made in the video. Allegations of exploitation of Minnesota’s social safety net have also been extensively covered by local and national news media over the past several years, and prosecutors brought charges over one allegedly massive scheme during the Biden administration.\nIn recent weeks, Trump has intensified his xenophobic attacks on Somali Americans, including his long-running nemesis Ilhan Omar, a representative from Minnesota who is Somali American and came to the US as a refugee. He has said that Omar is “garbage” and said Somalia is “no good for a reason”.\n“When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don’t want them in our country,” Trump said in one December cabinet meeting. “Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.”\nTim Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota who is running for re-election this year, denounced the Trump administration’s freeze of Minnesota’s funding as part of “Trump’s long game”.\n“We’ve spent years cracking down on fraudsters. It’s a serious issue - but this has been his plan all along,” Walz said in a Tuesday post on X.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/trump-administration-childcare-funding-freeze", "published_at": "2025-12-31T23:13:34+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The Republican-controlled House judiciary committee earlier this year heard testimony from one of Smith’s top deputies, and months later subpoenaed the former special counsel for private testimony. Smith had offered to voluntarily testify in public, as special counsels typically do.\nIn questioning from Democratic congressman Dan Goldman, Smith said he operated without interference from Merrick Garland, the attorney general who appointed him, or any other top justice department officials.\n“Did President Biden ever give you any instructions about what you should or should not do related to these investigations?” Goldman asked.\n“No,” Smith replied, later specifying he had not spoken to Biden about his cases in any way.\nSmith was appointed in November 2022, and quickly brought the two federal cases against Trump, who also faced state-level charges of election interference in Georgia, and falsifying business records in New York.\nWhile he would later be convicted of 34 felonies in the Manhattan case, neither of Trump’s federal indictments went to trial before he returned to office following the 2024 election, after which Smith, in line with justice department policy, dropped the charges.\nThe election-interference case was slowed by pretrial motions, including a supreme court ruling that gave presidents immunity for official acts and forced Smith to make changes to his case. The classified-documents case was hampered by rulings from Florida judge Aileen Cannon, who at one point dismissed Smith’s indictment.\nSmith authored a report into his prosecutions, and the portion covering the election interference case was released prior to Biden leaving office. However, Cannon has barred the chapter discussing the classified-documents charges from being made public, though Democrats on the judiciary committee have asked her to reverse her decision.\nAt the outset of the hearing, an attorney for Smith, Peter Koski, told the committee the former special counsel had received an email from the justice department advising him to avoid talking about his evidence in the case because of Cannon’s ruling.\n“This restriction significantly limits Mr Smith’s ability to discuss the classified-documents case. Nevertheless, Mr Smith is committed to doing his best to answering questions consistent with the department’s guidance,” Koski said.\nIn his more-than-eight-hour of testimony, Smith insisted he had no political motivations in indicting Trump, and said he believed “we had proof beyond a reasonable doubt in both cases” that he brought.\n“If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that president was a Republican or a Democrat,” he said in his opening statement. Smith later told an unnamed committee staffer he would have indicted Biden or Barack Obama over similar evidence.\nRepublicans have been in uproar after it emerged that federal investigators obtained data related to the phone usage of several members of Congress, which was used as part of Smith’s prosecutions. Smith hit back in his testimony, saying: “Recent narratives about my team’s work are false and misleading” and the “records were lawfully subpoenaed and were relevant to complete a comprehensive investigation”.\nThe only data collected, Smith said, was incoming and outgoing phone numbers and the calls’ durations, not their contents themselves. The data helped show that Trump continued to press his allies to stop Biden from formally becoming president, even as his followers were attacking the US Capitol on January 6, he added.\n“President Trump and his associates tried to call members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election. I did not choose those members, President Trump did,” Smith said.\nTrump has repeatedly railed against Smith, and in his testimony the former special counsel acknowledged the risk that the president could come after him.\n“I have no doubt that the president wants to seek retribution against me,” Smith said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/jack-smith-house-testimony", "published_at": "2025-12-31T22:34:10+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

It also followed a rare rebuke from the US supreme court, which blocked the White House’s efforts to deploy national guards in Illinois.\nTrump attempted to paint the decision as temporary in a post on his Truth Social platform, vowing to redeploy at a later date and insisting the initiative had been a success.\n“We are removing the National Guard from Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland, despite the fact that CRIME has been greatly reduced by having these great Patriots in those cities, and ONLY by that fact,” he wrote.\n“Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago were GONE if it weren’t for the Federal Government stepping in. We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again – Only a question of time!”\nYet there seemed little doubt that the latest move amounted to a retreat. Earlier on Wednesday, Newsom had hailed the justice department’s decision, announced in a filing with the ninth circuit court of appeals, backing away from its argument that Trump had a right to put state national guard troops under his authority indefinitely.\n“This admission by Trump and his occult cabinet members means this illegal intimidation tactic will finally come to an end,” wrote Newsom, who vocally and vigorously opposed the deployments on the streets of Los Angeles.\nIn a statement on Wednesday evening, Newsom said he had directed California national guard leaders to “return state service members home to be with their families as soon as possible”.\nTrump initially ordered national guard members into the city last June in response to protests against raids conduced by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The deployment has been subject to a succession of legal challenges, with Newsom arguing that the situation did not justify the presence of federal forces and that Trump was exceeding his powers.\nA lower court ruled earlier this month that Trump had seized control of the national guard members illegally and ordered them returned to state authority. The administration had originally contested that ruling.\nIts change of tack amounted to the second setback in a week to Trump’s quest to federalize national guard units to quell displays of dissent against his highly contentious immigration policies, which he and other administration figures have depicted as violent riots.\nLast week, the US supreme court delivered a rare rebuke by refusing to allow the administration to deploy national guards in Chicago – a move opposed by the city’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, and the governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, who are both Democrats.\nTrump’s announcement casts doubts on the future of national guard deployments in other Democratic-run cities, including Washington DC and New Orleans, where 350 troops were expected to arrive by New Year’s Eve.\nTroops have been deployed in Washington DC since last August, purportedly to counteract a supposed “crime wave”. One national guard was killed and another seriously wounded after being shot by a gunman outside a metro station in the city on 26 November.\nThe incident led to an increase in the number guard members deployed in Washington, as well as an intensification of Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric after it emerged that the suspected assailant was an Afghan national who had been granted political asylum in the US. More than 2,000 troops have been deployed in Washington DC since August, with many being drafted in from at least 11 Republican-led states.\nA federal appeals court ruled this month that the troops can remain while a panel of judges establish whether their deployment is legal. A lower court had earlier ordered that they be removed.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/trump-national-guard-deployment-stopped", "published_at": "2025-12-31T22:27:20+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

By staying the course, we will defeat the decline and division offered by others.”\nIn an indication that he believes 2026 could be the year when the fortunes of the country and his party begin to change, he added: “When Britain turns the corner with our future now in our control, the real Britain will shine through more strongly.”\nStarmer goes into 2026 as the least popular prime minister ever, according to some polls, with his party heading for bruising results in May’s elections and some of his MPs agitating for his removal.\nMany Labour MPs have spent the Christmas break in their constituencies, where they have had to confront voter anger at early policy decisions.\n“I’ve spent a bit more time in the constituency in the last couple of weeks and it’s far worse than I thought,” said one. “There are real levels of hostility.”\nThe prime minister’s advisers acknowledge the scale of the problem, but believe they can begin to change voters’ minds this year as the impact of decisions made over the first 18 months begins to be felt.\nSpeaking to fellow advisers before Christmas, McSweeney said this would not be a “year of promises” but a “year of proof”, when public services would begin to improve and bills start to fall.\nStarmer and his ministers will highlight their action on the cost of living in the first few weeks of the new year, including in a speech by the prime minister that will emphasise recent interest rate cuts that have brought mortgage costs to their lowest since 2022.\nHe will also talk about abolishing the two-child benefit cap, a policy the government is planning to focus on when it introduces a standalone bill to parliament next week to enact it.\nMeanwhile, Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, is putting the finishing touches to the £13bn warm homes plan that will detail how the government will spend its energy efficiency and low-carbon funding.\nOfficials say the plan will focus on green technology such as solar panels and batteries, rather than home insulation, which was the focus of the recently scrapped energy companies obligation (Eco).\nThe plan will scrap regulations that prevent people from plugging solar panels into domestic plug sockets, a technology widely used in Germany and other European countries.\nScrapping the Eco scheme and reducing renewables levies will save energy users an estimated £138 on average, according to a calculation by the consultancy Cornwall Insight.\nMinisters are keen to show how their energy efficiency funding will also help bring bills down in the longer term, with Miliband framing his package as another cost of living measure.\nOne government source said: “There will be a big focus in our warm homes [plan] on the clean tech products that can deliver energy bill reductions in the short and medium terms for households.”\nStarmer plans to couple this action with a charm offensive designed to win over his own MPs. The prime minister has invited Labour members to receptions at his countryside grace-and-favour home in a series of events across January and February.\nOfficials say he will use the informal gatherings in part to strengthen the message that MPs should spend the run-up to May’s elections talking about the cost of living. Early indications, however, suggest his plans are being met with a mixed reception among parliamentary colleagues, many of whom feel angry about a bruising first 18 months in power.\nOne said: “The parliamentary Labour party has a wealth of skills and experience which are being ignored. It is a bizarre approach that weakens us as a government and breeds resentment.”\nAnother said they would not be taking up the invitation to attend Chequers. “I’ve been invited but the idea of making small talk and pretending everything is fine is just [being sick emoji].”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/31/keir-starmer-woo-voters-labour-mps-new-year-plan-cut-cost-of-living", "published_at": "2025-12-31T22:30:22+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

I would rule it out with Keir Starmer, but I wouldn’t rule it out with Burnham.”\nA coalition would require the Greens getting an adequate number of seats at the next general election to make the party useful to Labour, and would also need Burnham to once again gain a seat as an MP.\nPolanski argued Labour’s plan for the economy was not working. He called for a wealth tax, as well as an increase in capital gains tax to bring it in line with income tax. “I am challenging a broken, failed economic model, and the people defending it have no answer other than just to continue with what is broken,” he said.\nHowever, Gary Lineker defended the prime minister in an interview with Polanski, saying he had met Starmer “two or three times” and he “seemed a very nice guy”.\n“I think he’s having a tough time. Obviously he’s not a hugely charismatic leader, but I don’t necessarily think that’s important,” the football pundit and TV presenter said.\nSpeaking on the podcast Bold Politics with Zack Polanski, Lineker also said there was “too much political influence from the very top” of the BBC, and the organisation had “tied itself up in knots” over impartiality.\nThe former Match of the Day presenter, who quit the BBC earlier this year, said he had a “great affinity” with the institution but: “I think they’ve got a little bit broad into this whole impartiality thing and I think that that makes it very, very difficult for them.”\nLineker said in recent years, impartiality had been expanded beyond news and current affairs and into the rest of the BBC. “Even though we’d been on social media for years, we were expected to suddenly change. And I thought that was difficult,” he said.\n“Overall, there are thousands and thousands and thousands of people that work for the BBC that are really, really good people that do excellent jobs. But I think it’s tied itself up in knots a little bit with the impartiality thing because I think what we really need is truth and reporting, in that sense. It’s impossible to be impartial on everything.”\nHe added: “My personal issues, it was difficult, it was over a long period of time.”\nLineker said the way a government decided who was on the board of the BBC and who was chair should be done with more of a “neutral” perspective, because those brought in by politicians “will obviously be partial”.\n“If they’re going to talk about impartiality, start at the top,” he said. “It’s incredibly difficult for the BBC, but I think at the moment there’s too much political influence from the very top.”\nPolanski asked the presenter why he had been so outspoken about immigration.\nLineker said: “I know it’s an issue, immigration, I know it’s difficult, you can’t take everybody. But I think we should do our fair share and look after people.\n“I have empathy towards their situation. I think there’s a small percentage that are the opposite, so I felt it was quite important to use my platform to perhaps speak on behalf of those that don’t have a voice.”\nThough he had suffered a backlash online from the right, having been a footballer, “you learn to deal with abuse”. He said: “I took it as a compliment.”\nIn 2026, Lineker said, he wanted to see “proper peace” in Gaza.\n“We’ve got a ceasefire but it’s not really a ceasefire at the moment,” he said. “I’ve spoken about this quite a bit and I look at my phone every day and I cry most days when I see it. I mean, innocent kids being just killed [with] snipers and bombs. It’s just immeasurably wrong.”\nHe added: “And of course Israel has the right to defend itself. But then why doesn’t Palestine have the right to defend itself? It doesn’t.”\nLineker, who has received criticism for talking about the plight of Palestinians in Gaza, said: “People will disagree with this and they try and make an argument but I always say to them, if you genuinely think this is fabricated, let journalists in.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/31/uk-green-party-zack-polanski-labour-andy-burnham-keir-starmer-gary-lineker-bbc", "published_at": "2025-12-31T18:38:43+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

She was “married off” to an IS fighter with whom she had three children, all of whom died in infancy.\nIn 2019, the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, revoked her citizenship on grounds of national security, in a decision upheld in the court of appeal last year and backed by the current government.\nCampaigners and Begum’s lawyers argue she was the victim of child trafficking. Begum, now 26, remains stateless in a Syrian refugee camp.\nA document published by the European court this month confirms that Begum is challenging Javid’s decision under article 4 of the European convention on human rights – a prohibition of slavery and forced labour.\nThe case was lodged in December 2024, after she was denied the chance to challenge the removal of her British citizenship at the UK’s supreme court.\nAmong four questions posed by judges in Strasbourg to the Home Office, they asked: “Did the secretary of state have a positive obligation, by virtue of article 4 of the convention, to consider whether the applicant had been a victim of trafficking and whether any duties or obligations to her flowed from that fact, before deciding to deprive her of her citizenship?”\nBirnberg Peirce Solicitors, which is representing Begum, said the court’s communication “presents an unprecedented opportunity” for the UK and Begum to “grapple with the significant considerations raised in her case and ignored, sidestepped or violated up to now by previous UK administrations”.\nOne of the lawyers, Gareth Peirce, said: “It is impossible to dispute that a 15-year-old British child was in 2014-15 lured, encouraged and deceived for the purposes of sexual exploitation to leave home and travel to [IS-controlled] territory for the known purpose of being given, as a child, to an [IS] fighter to propagate children for the Islamic State.”\nShe added: “It is equally impossible not to acknowledge the catalogue of failures to protect a child known for weeks beforehand to be at high risk when a close friend had disappeared to Syria in an identical way and via an identical route.\n“It has already been long conceded that the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, who took the precipitous decision in 2019 very publicly to deprive Ms Begum of citizenship, had failed entirely to consider the issues of grooming and trafficking of a school child in London and of the state’s consequent duties.”\nPierce said the challenge came as the current government had made protections for victims of grooming and trafficking a national priority.\nA Home Office spokesperson said any decision made to protect national security would be robustly defended. They added: “The government will always protect the UK and its citizens. That is why Shamima Begum – who posed a national security threat – had her British citizenship revoked and is unable to return to the UK.”\nThe shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, said Begum had “no place” in the UK because of her support for violent extremists. In a post on X, he wrote: “It is deeply concerning the European Court of Human Rights is now looking at using the ECHR to make the UK take her back.”\nAlso on X, Richard Tice, Reform’s deputy leader, wrote: “ECHR can jog on….none of their business …just another reason why we must leave this foreign court.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/31/european-human-rights-court-questions-uk-decision-to-strip-shamima-begum-of-citizenship", "published_at": "2025-12-31T17:01:19+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Fences have been erected around the viewing spot in Camden Park in north London to stop revellers gathering where 30,000 people watched the fireworks last year.\nThe Royal Parks charity, which manages Primrose Hill, said the decision was taken on safety grounds, after the Metropolitan police disbanded the Royal Parks specialist policing team this year.\nElsewhere in the UK, the weather is likely to be perfect for fireworks, dry with clear skies, though temperatures are due to be chilly, making extra layers a necessity, the Met Office said.\nMoving into Friday, weather warnings for snow are in place in Northern Ireland and stretching from Wales, across parts of the north-west, the West Midlands and through to London and most of the south-east of England.\nTransport is expected to be affected, with people advised to allow extra time for journeys on the road and delays and cancellations expected on public transport.\nThe forecaster Simon Partridge said as 2026 began it would be “cold regardless of where you are”.\nHe said: “At midnight in London there will be mostly clear skies, it will be quite chilly, but with fairly light winds, with temperatures around 1-2C. For Cardiff it’s again dry, there will be a bit more cloud around but still dry, again light winds, temperatures there a little bit warmer, 2-3C.”\nPartridge said farther north there would be cloudier skies, but this was not expected to affect visibility for watching fireworks displays. “We are not looking at low cloud, mist or murk, so you should be able to see fireworks, just not stars.”\nWednesday had a frosty start to the morning with fog lingering in the south-west but this made way for winter sunshine.\nPatches of freezing fog were expected in the west and north-west of England during the day, the national weather service said, and advised those travelling early on New Year’s Day to take care.\nIn a post on X, the Met Office said: “A cold New Year’s Eve evening for those out celebrating, so extra layers will be needed.”\nIn London, where tens of thousands of partygoers will head to the banks of the Thames to watch the mayor’s annual fireworks display, the temperature will be just above freezing when Big Ben strikes midnight.\nGoing into 2026, temperatures are expected to drop further as snow and gale-force winds are expected to batter the north of the country.\nAbout 10cm of snow is expected to have accumulated in some areas by Friday morning, reaching up to 30cm on the highest roads and hills.\nMeanwhile, amber cold health alerts have been issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) for the north-east and north-west of England and are due to remain in place until noon on 5 January, with temperatures expected to fall to 3-5C.\nThe UKHSA said this meant the weather was likely to cause significant impacts across health and social care services, including a rise in the number of deaths among those with health conditions or aged 65 and over.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/31/new-year-revellers-told-wrap-up-warm-snow-uk-weather", "published_at": "2025-12-31T16:08:48+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Two years earlier, he had been named by the ringleader, Shakil Chowdhury, as an alleged accomplice in Walker-Roberts’s abuse but Greater Manchester police failed to follow up on this and closed the case.\nDozens of items recovered from Chowdhury’s home, where Walker-Roberts says she was raped for hours by five men, were destroyed by officers or returned to Chowdhury. She was trafficked around the town to be abused by several groups of men after being kidnapped from a police station where she had tried to report an earlier assault.\nThe Guardian understands that Offender J is now unlikely to face charges in relation to Walker-Roberts’s ordeal because the surviving forensic evidence does not link him to her abuse. Chowdhury, jailed for six years in 2007, remains the only man to be convicted in the case, but Walker-Roberts was told last month that officers were pursuing two outstanding suspects.\nSarwar Ali absconded after being charged with rape and has never been traced. Police are trying to identify a third man forensically linked to the case. The Guardian understands he appears not to have come to police attention before.\nWalker-Roberts said: “All my life, I’ve been told I need to move on but how can I, when I don’t have the answers? Most people get closure when they get a sentence but I’ll never be at that stage, so for me the answers are closure.”\nShe added that she “gave up hope a long time ago” that all of the men involved in her abuse would be brought to justice but feared they had attacked other victims. “I’m praying that others will come forward, I want others to get justice in one form or another,” she said.\nAn internal police inquiry concluded in 2014 that Offender J’s wife may have been spared his attack if forensic inquiries had been adequately conducted in Walker-Roberts’s case.\nA review of the remaining forensic evidence during this investigation linked two other girls to Chowdhury’s property. They were interviewed and said they’d had sex with Chowdhury at his home when they were 16 but appear not to have made criminal complaints.\nA safeguarding review commissioned by Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said in 2022 it had been unable to assess the quality of the inquiries made after the original forensic submissions.\nIt added that Offender J’s wife told police in 2011 that he had admitted to her that he had raped a 12-year-old. She said Offender J had kept newspaper clippings relating to Chowdhury’s court case and subsequent conviction.\nThe information was passed to Operation Messenger, a now defunct multi-agency taskforce designed to combat child sexual exploitation in Oldham, but again was not acted on. The safeguarding review said this was a “serious failure”.\nIn 2007, 22 items of evidence from Chowdhury’s home, including bedding and a towel, were returned to him via his solicitor, despite possible relevance to outstanding suspects. The following year, officers destroyed a further 24 items, including material from Chowdhury’s car and the contents of his bin.\nWhen challenged by Walker-Roberts eight years later, the force was unable to provide a “forensic strategy” relating to her case. Walker-Roberts said she was asked to pick out Offender J at a police ID parade in 2014 as part of a new investigation, but was unable to identify him.\nFailings in Oldham have been central to the establishment of a national inquiry into grooming gangs, which will be chaired by the former children’s commissioner Anne Longfield when it begins in March.\nThe government initially resisted calls for a national inquiry – including those from the owner of X, Elon Musk – instead funding a local investigation in Oldham chaired by a former judge, Tom Crowther, who had led a similar inquiry in Telford, Shropshire.\nHowever, an audit by the Whitehall troubleshooter Louise Casey suggested a national inquiry was needed. Crowther has now been stood down and the Oldham investigation will be absorbed into the wider inquiry.\nThe national inquiry, which will look at abuse in England and Wales, has been mired in controversy since it was announced in June.\nIn October, four women quit a survivor advisory panel, saying they felt the government was manipulating them to expand the scope of the inquiry beyond street-based grooming gangs.\nThey called for the resignation of the safeguarding minister, Jess Phillips, but five others, including Walker-Roberts, wrote to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, to support her.\nLongfield was selected to chair the investigation after the two previous frontrunners, a former police officer Jim Gamble, and a former social worker, Annie Hudson, withdrew.\nA spokesperson for Greater Manchester police said that Walker-Roberts had “suffered horrific abuse which was compounded by appalling failures by the authorities that should’ve protected her at that time”, and that she had received an apology in 2022.\n“The way Samantha was treated by police was far from the standard survivors can expect from the GMP of today. Since one man was convicted of abusing Samantha we have two further suspects we are determined to bring to court to face charges. One remains charged and remains outstanding – efforts to locate him will not stop until he is found. There is a further suspect forensically linked to the investigation whose identity we are trying to establish.”\n-\nInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

One girl, later referred to in court as Child X, fell into their clutches while truanting when she was 12 years old. By 14, she had been abused by 300 men and was addicted to crack cocaine and heroin.\n“Unless you scratch below the surface you do not realise the enormity of the problem,” Ruth Baldwin, then the executive director for young people and families at Oldham council, said in December 2006. “We are not talking about teenage relationships. These are men in their 20s, 30s, and beyond.”\nAlmost two decades later, on New Year’s Day 2025, the fate of girls in this former mill town on the eastern fringes of Manchester caught the attention of the world’s richest man. GB News reported that the safeguarding minister, Jess Phillips, had told Oldham council the government would not fund a statutory inquiry into child sexual exploitation in the town. In response, Elon Musk said on X that Phillips should be in prison.\nThe media storm that resulted forced a reckoning on an issue that has come to haunt Britain, not least because of the apparent over-representation of men of Asian heritage in the gangs that plagued towns such as Oldham. Several inquiries have already established that a nervousness about race hampered the response in other parts of the country.\nMusk’s intervention was controversial. He was criticised for spreading misinformation and weaponising the issue to fuel a far-right agenda. But it set in motion a chain of events that forced the government to commission a statutory national inquiry on grooming gangs, covering England and Wales. A central strand will focus on what went wrong in Oldham, and it will look at “how ethnicity, religion or culture played a role in responses”.\nAlthough Oldham council now accepts its failings and has welcomed the national inquiry, at first some officials were privately baffled by the scrutiny the town was receiving. For many years, Oldham had prided itself on a child sexual exploitation strategy that was seen as being ahead of its time.\nWhen Baldwin, who left Oldham council in 2007, first spoke of her concerns about teenagers being preyed on by older men the previous year, she announced a new taskforce designed to combat the problem. The project – involving the council, police, health services and the charity Barnardo’s – was named Operation Messenger. It was seen as being so groundbreaking that it won a Greater Manchester police award for partnership working in its first year. Yet the accolades the project received obscured a troubling truth: Operation Messenger failed many of the girls it came into contact with.\nA safeguarding review, commissioned by the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, and published in 2022, concluded that “the quality of casework by both the police and social care” working on Operation Messenger was “generally very poor and characterised by a failure to appropriately initiate multi-agency child protection procedures when children were known to be at risk of significant harm”.\nThe review found no evidence to substantiate social media rumours that the Labour-led council was covering up the scale of the problem to protect its vote among the town’s Muslim population. Operation Messenger investigated alleged offenders from a range of racial backgrounds, including white men. However, exploitation by British Asian men – particularly those of Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage – formed a significant chunk of its caseload. Throughout the project’s eight-year lifespan, the agencies involved wrestled with how to address the problem without fuelling the far right, perhaps mindful that Oldham had already been torn apart by racial division during the 2001 riots.\n“Sexual exploitation is a real issue, and we need to be addressing it,” a 2011 memo from Greater Manchester police read. “People feel strongly about this issue and there is the potential for it to escalate. There is the perception that there is a conspiracy of silence due to political correctness and that some areas are not dealing with the issue.”\nPolice said in the same document that there was a “need to continue to provide support to the Messenger team” but warned: “Further cases in Oldham might bring wider media interest and further exploitation of the issue by the BNP and English Defence League. There is therefore a risk of further demonstrations and the risk of increased hate crimes.” It added that Muslim communities felt “demonised”.\nOne victim referred to in Operation Messenger, Samantha Walker-Roberts, has expressed concern about her story being hijacked by far-right groups. She was 12 when she was kidnapped from a police station in October 2006, as she tried to report a sexual assault by a man in a nearby churchyard. She was then trafficked around the town to be abused by multiple men. She ended the night in a quiet cul-de-sac, at the home of Shakil Chowdhury, where she remembers being raped for hours by five men.\nOnly Chowdhury was convicted and vital forensic evidence that could have helped trace outstanding suspects was destroyed or returned to him via his solicitor. During his trial, Chowdhury named two accomplices, but police did not follow up this information, according to the 2022 safeguarding review. The men remained at large and, in 2009, one tried to murder his wife. In 2011, this man’s wife told police he had confessed to raping a 12-year-old and had even kept newspaper clippings about Chowdhury’s trial. Again, the Messenger team did not act.\nGreater Manchester police said in a statement that the treatment Walker-Roberts received was “far from the standard survivors can expect” from the force today and added that it was pursuing “long and complex investigations” into historical child sexual exploitation, which include Walker-Roberts’ case.\nWalker-Roberts, now 32, has campaigned for an independent inquiry in Oldham for more than five years and hopes it will help establish whether Chowdhury, a British citizen born in Bangladesh, and his accomplices could have been stopped before they attacked her. Many years after her ordeal she tracked down some of his former neighbours; she later told the council and the safeguarding review that they recalled a “conveyor belt” of children arriving at Chowdhury’s house in taxis. Separate sources say at least one neighbour tried to alert the council before Chowdhury was arrested.\nOn another occasion, a few months before Walker-Roberts was targeted, the Guardian understands a 14-year-old girl, missing from a children’s home 20 miles away in another county, was found in the street, apparently having just visited Chowdhury’s house. Sources say a neighbour who helped return her to the home was later visited by detectives from another force, but Chowdhury appears to have escaped their inquiries unscathed.\nWhen police reviewed Walker-Roberts’s case in 2014, surviving forensic evidence linked two teenage girls to Chowdhury’s property. They were interviewed and said they’d had sex with Chowdhury there when they were 16 but appear not to have made criminal complaints. The safeguarding review said this helped “support [Walker-Roberts’s] later assertion” that Chowdhury’s home “was a place where young women were sexually exploited by Asian males”.\nThere are also fears that senior officials didn’t understand the complexities of child sexual exploitation. Peter Fahy, a former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, described Operation Messenger, which was closed and absorbed into a regional taskforce in 2014, as being focused on “child prostitution”.\nThe story of Child X – the 12-year-old who went on to be abused by 300 men after she started skipping school – came to light when she stabbed one alleged offender in a row over money. The person the police pursued was an older teenager who had introduced the girl to the offenders. She was in her early 20s by the time she appeared in court. She was handed a 12-month suspended sentence and ordered to sign the sex offender register for 10 years for causing and arranging for a child to enter into prostitution.\nThe judge told the older girl she had avoided jail because her case was “exceptional”. “Your life has not been too dissimilar to that of the girl,” he said. “You had been subject to all manner of abuse.” Whether her case really was exceptional may be a matter for the inquiry.\nA few months later, another case came before the same court. A 20-year-old defendant was sentenced to a 12-month supervision order for the repeated abduction of a girl from Oldham who had been abused by Asian men. The girl’s ordeal had begun when she was 10 and the defendant was 16 with a “boyfriend” who took them out in cars to drink alcohol with other men. The Guardian sent a freedom of information request to Greater Manchester police, asking how many teenage girls had been arrested or charged by Operation Messenger, but the force said it would be too expensive to retrieve the data.\nWalker-Roberts, who was once described in files as “attention-seeking” when she disclosed her abuse to a social worker, hopes the Oldham strand of the inquiry will focus just as much on how victims like her were treated by the professionals employed to help them as it will on the cultural factors that could have led to them being abused. She said many were already vulnerable by the time they were targeted by grooming gangs, having experienced domestic or sexual abuse within their families.\n“They thought we were problem children causing chaos,” she said. “In reality, we were being abused. We weren’t being listened to properly. Even now, I still think attitudes to victims are not the best.”\n-\nInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

But NHS England said hospitals remained under “incredible” pressure, with 95% of beds full. The cold weather was likely to escalate the situation, it said.\nOn Wednesday, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued amber warnings for every region of England, which will be in place between 8pm on Wednesday until 10am next Tuesday.\nPreviously, only north-east and north-west England were under an amber alert, with all other regions under a yellow alert. Amber cold health alerts are issued when the forecast weather is “likely to cause significant impacts across health and social care services”.\nDr Paul Coleman, a health protection consultant at the UKHSA, said it was likely to be “very cold” across England over the next few days. “Low temperatures like these can have serious impacts on the health of some people, particularly older people and those with serious health conditions.\n“Exposure to cold can lead to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections. It is therefore really important, as the colder weather sets in, to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.”\nWednesday’s NHS figures showed an average of 117 patients with flu were in critical care beds in the week ending 21 December, down from 128 the previous week. Separately, an average of 285 hospital beds were filled each day in the week ending 21 December by patients with diarrhoea and vomiting or norovirus-like symptoms, down from 427 the previous week.\nProf Meghana Pandit, NHS England’s medical director, said the health service remained “under extraordinary pressure”, adding: “While there are signs of improvement and the NHS is in calmer waters, pressures on hospitals remain incredibly high and we’re not out of danger yet with temperatures set to drop in the coming days.”\nWes Streeting, the health secretary, praised NHS staff for their efforts but said hospitals were “not out of the woods yet, with flu continuing to be a challenge”.\nRory Deighton, an acute and community care director at the NHS Confederation, added: “Services are still seeing high levels of demand due to seasonal viruses and bed occupancy is around 95%, which is well above safe levels. There are also thousands of patients stuck in hospital beds despite being medically well enough to go home, in part due to a lack of community and social care.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/31/nhs-amber-cold-health-alerts-england", "published_at": "2025-12-31T12:58:17+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

But many are becoming swamped with patients whose health concerns should be dealt with elsewhere, including a near tenfold increase in people seeking help for a cough.\nA&E attendances for hiccups, dizziness and a myriad of other minor conditions have also soared. The trend of patients heading to emergency departments with non-emergency symptoms is underlined by the fact that doctors found nothing wrong with more than 2 million A&E patients in 2024-25.\nIt comes as Wes Streeting, the health secretary, faces pressure to show he is making progress after a year and a half in charge of the NHS. Last month Prof Kamila Hawthorne, Britain’s most senior GP, told the Guardian that surgeries wanted to hire more doctors to meet demand for primary care but could not afford to do so because of a lack of core funding.\nAs people continue to be urged to stay at home over the new year period if they have symptoms of flu or Covid, analysis of NHS data by the PA Media news agency found more patients were turning to A&E for minor conditions.\nIn the last five years, doctors saw almost 1.9m cases of people seeking help for a headache. Almost 1.4m A&E attendances in England from 2020-21 to 2024-25 were for a cough and 1.2m were for a sore throat.\nOne million A&E attendances were due to earache, according to the analysis. There were almost 69,000 A&E attendances for a blocked nose, 4,200 for hiccups and 290,000 cases of constipation.\nThe figures show how A&E attendances for some medical emergencies have stayed relatively consistent during and since the pandemic. For instance, 10,293 attendances owing to cardiac arrest were recorded in 2020-21, compared with 10,744 in 2024-25. The number of people diagnosed in A&E with a broken hip was 43,646 in 2020-21 and 43,326 in 2024-25.\nAt the same time, there has been a notable increase in attendances for minor ailments. About 44,000 cases of “cough” were dealt with in 2020-21 and the number has risen every year to reach 435,728 in 2024-25 – a near tenfold increase.\nThere were 59,120 A&E attendances where the chief complaint was diarrhoea in 2020-21, rising each year to reach 143,591 by 2024-25. Cases of constipation grew from 40,962 to 70,933, backache from 211,266 to 396,724, nausea from 9,795 to 20,516, and hiccups from 587 to 1,093.\nDoctors recorded “no abnormality was detected” for 2.2m A&E attendances in 2024-25, while more than half a million patients walked out before a first diagnosis was made, the figures show.\nThe government’s 10-year plan for the health service has vowed to shift care away from hospitals, creating a “neighbourhood health service” in towns and cities across the country.\nBut Daniel Elkeles, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said the shift needed to happen much more quickly. “Patients choosing to attend A&E for help with relatively simple conditions like earache lays bare a failure to give people enough access to convenient, responsive services closer to home where they can get the help they need there and then,” he said.\n“Our new year’s wish would be to see neighbourhood healthcare ‘turbocharged’ to create many more primary care appointments, in communities and GP practices, to boost patients’ satisfaction with the NHS and ease pressure on busy A&Es.”\nDr Ian Higginson, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: “This is a symptom of the healthcare system not working as it was designed to. Just like our EDs [emergency departments], our colleagues in primary and community services are at capacity when their services are open, but those services often aren’t open when patients need them.”\nThe National Pharmacy Association chief executive, Henry Gregg, said people were spending hours in A&E with issues that could instead be treated in a community pharmacy.\n“Pharmacists are highly trained healthcare professionals and can now supply prescription medicines on the NHS without the need for a GP appointment, for a range of common illnesses,” he said.\nNHS England said staff were working hard to expand the number of routes into the health service so patients could get fast and convenient care closer to them. It urged people to use alternatives to A&E to get help in the most appropriate place, including services online, via phone or in person.\nA spokesperson added: “As always, the public should use A&E and 999 for life-threatening conditions and serious injuries – and for non-life-threatening care, call NHS 111 or use 111 online, which can direct you to the most appropriate place – whether that be your local pharmacy, a walk-in centre or clinical self-help advice.”\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said there was a “long road ahead” to fix the NHS, but said it was “already delivering change” by shifting care out of hospitals and into communities. GP teams delivered 6.5m more appointments in the past 12 months, backed by £1.1bn of extra investment, a spokesperson added.\nThey said: “We’re getting rubber to the road and building new neighbourhood health services, increasing funding for community pharmacy services and building more community diagnostic centres which offer evening and weekend appointments.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/31/coughs-hiccups-accident-and-emergency-hospitals-nhs-england", "published_at": "2025-12-31T10:44:24+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Network Rail said cable thefts cost the public millions of pounds each year and the knock-on effect to the economy was even greater.\nIt said the number of incidents had risen sharply in recent years – likely due to the rising value of raw materials such as copper, which has made the theft of signalling cables a lucrative haul for criminals.\nIn 2025 there have been more than 102 incidents of live cables being stolen across the railway, causing 104,737 minutes of train delays and costing £5.1m. These included the theft of copper cables on the Eurostar line between London and Paris in June, disrupting thousands of passengers.\nThere were 108 incidents of cable theft across Britain in 2024, causing 69,275 minutes of train delays and costing £3.3m.

The buildings have been demolished or converted into housing, offices, nurseries, cafés or other uses. Once repurposed, they almost never return to pub use.”\nThe figures highlight a familiar tale of pub closures as the pressure on the hospitality sector continues to have a noticeable impact: almost 2,000 pubs have disappeared over the past five years even though the pace of decline has marginally slowed.\nEvery region of England and Wales recorded a net loss of pubs during 2025, with the largest declines seen in the East Midlands, the north-west and Yorkshire and the Humber, the figures showed.\nThe closures came as pubs were among businesses to face increases in the national minimum wage and national insurance contributions in April this year – with the outlook for the sector appearing even tougher.\nFrom April 2026, the rateable value of almost all commercial businesses – which is used to determine the amount of tax paid in business rates – will be recalculated, as is custom every three years.\nFor pubs and some other hospitality sectors, the rise has been unexpectedly large, even with a three-year tapered relief that the government announced in the budget, designed to prevent big increases.\nProbyn said: “This data should serve as a wake-up call … Many [pubs] survived the pandemic through resilience and community support, only to be pushed to the brink by rising costs and a rating system that no longer reflects economic reality.”\nEmma McClarkin, the chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, added: “Many of these closures are totally unnecessary and the result of a heavy tax and rates burden, which is why it’s never been more vital for a pub-specific business rates relief which could prevent more closures and more job losses.\n“The situation is drastic and we want to work with government to ensure pubs are given a fair deal, otherwise communities will lose cherished local institutions and, once they’re gone, they’re gone for good.”\nA Treasury spokesperson said: “The fair and necessary decisions we made at this budget and the last mean we can deliver on the country’s priorities – cutting waiting lists, cutting debt and borrowing, and cutting the cost of living.\n“We’re also protecting pubs and other businesses with the budget’s £4.3bn support package, bringing total bill increases for pubs down to 4% instead of the 45% they would have faced without our support.\n“This comes on top of our efforts to ease licensing to help more venues offer pavement drinks and put on one-off events, maintaining our cut to alcohol duty on draught pints, and capping corporation tax.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/31/one-pub-a-day-closed-permanently-in-england-and-wales-in-2025", "published_at": "2025-12-31T11:39:17+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

He told the Guardian he had “never seen anything comparable on a UK-established domestic broadcaster”.\nOfcom officials have spent the last few weeks examining at least three detailed complaints co-signed by tens of thousands of people, but have not yet decided whether to launch a formal investigation. The regulator is facing increasing accusations that it is reluctant to intervene over politically difficult issues of impartiality.\nThe complaints point to rules stating broadcasters must not “materially mislead the audience” and rules around due impartiality.\nA complaint from Bob Ward, from the LSE’s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, focused on Trump’s claims about human-induced climate change. Trump stated: “The whole thing is a hoax … but your country is one of the worst.”\nTrump also made disputed claims about the red tape and taxes related to drilling in the North Sea, as well as stating that wind power was “the most expensive energy you can get”. This is contradicted by recent research.\nWard said: “The GB News interview with President Trump was the most blatant example of a British media organisation collaborating with the Trump administration to undermine British democracy with this misinformation.”\nComplaints have also been made about Trump’s claim that London has areas “where the police don’t even want to go” and that “you have sharia law where they don’t even want to obey the laws of … your country”.\nThere was no challenge from the comments from Turner. When Trump said people are “being stabbed in the ass or worse”, she stated: “It’s true … It’s awful, it is. And it feels much safer [in the US].”\nA complaint over a lack of impartiality from the 38 Degrees campaign group pointed to Turner “praising and endorsing Trump multiple times”. During the interview, she described a speech by Trump as “one of the greatest moments at the UN” and that she “loved it, it was brilliant”.\nGB News declined to comment on the complaints.\nGB News is emerging as a regular platform for Trump administration figures to raise chosen talking points. Trump’s White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has repeatedly promoted the broadcaster.\nBanatvala, who was Ofcom’s founding director of standards, said the regulator was under “intense pressure to act”.\nHe said: “This case poses a real challenge for the regulator – not least because of the considerable leeway it has already given GB News and because it involves an interview with a sitting US president.\n“While this style of interview – with no challenge and a presenter effectively feeding lines – may be the norm for Newsmax and Fox News, I’ve never seen anything comparable on a UK-established domestic broadcaster. There is no doubt this programme warrants investigation for potential breaches of the due impartiality and misleading rules.\n“If Ofcom chooses not to investigate, it would effectively signal that the regulator has abandoned impartiality and broadcasters no longer need to comply with these rules.”\nAn Ofcom spokesperson said: “We are assessing the complaints against our rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/dec/31/ofcom-urged-investigate-gb-news-interview-donald-trump-inaccuracy-claims", "published_at": "2025-12-31T14:22:09+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

More than a third of chosen words are either internet slang terms or owe their meanings to technological devices. The figure rises to two-thirds for words of the year from 2021.\nLynne Murphy, a professor of linguistics at the University of Sussex, is not surprised. “I think that’s sort of inevitable because that’s the way that words are spreading really easily these days. So, everybody’s much more aware of new words. There’s also just the fact that we’re in a really active time of technological change.”\nYet with the fleeting nature of much online content, it is perhaps to be expected that not many previously chosen words have stood the test of time. Oxford’s choice in 2022, “goblin mode” – “a type of behaviour which is unapologetically self-indulgent … in a way that rejects social norms or expectations” – may ring a bell but is now rarely used. Cambridge’s 2018 pick, “nomophobia” – the fear of being without your phone – is similarly obscure. NFT or non-fungible token (Collins, 2021) and “youthquake” (Oxford, 2017) have also significantly decreased in use, by 96% and 92% respectively, according to analysis of the News on the Web corpus.\nSome have fallen out of popularity for good reason. Words such as Brexit, vax and quarantine spoke to a particular time in social history whose urgency may have faded, even as its after-effects remain felt. Others, including austerity and climate emergency, have waxed and waned in tandem with political developments and changing priorities, although it is hard to imagine David Cameron’s “big society” ever making a comeback.\nOn the lack of longevity, Jonathan Dent, a senior editor at the Oxford English Dictionary, said: “Whether a word of the year survives as an active and widely recognised part of the language in the long term is really less important [than] that it has something to say about where we are now, this year.\n“If a candidate for word of the year maintains the kind of usage that led to its selection, that’s a sign that speakers and writers of English have found it a useful addition to their linguistic toolkit. If it doesn’t, that doesn’t mean it wasn’t a relevant and worthwhile choice in the year it was chosen.”\nWhile some linguists such as Murphy can be “a little bit cynical about some of the dictionary words of the years being about attention grabbing” and consider the annual ritual as “a marketing tool”, others view the exercise with less scepticism.\nLove said: “I would not in any way interpret [word of the year] as being a prediction one way or the other of how that word might be used in the future.\n“I think it’s just a fun way of getting people to talk about language, and particularly if they’re choosing words fairly consistently that are probably more likely to be used by younger people in online discourse, then that is a great way of engaging younger people with these sorts of conversations about language and words.”\nIn summary: don’t expect a word of the year to outlast it.\n“It’s marketing”, Green said. “Whether it works, I mean, that’s another side of it … [but] is it really something that the public feel ‘this sums up the year I have just lived’?”\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/dec/31/rage-bait-goblin-mode-do-words-of-the-year-have-any-real-value", "published_at": "2025-12-31T10:39:54+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

We need YOU to get them out,” ICE’s recruiting website says.\nThe administration’s hiring push comes after Donald Trump signed HR 1 into law in July, which allotted $45bn for immigration detention and $32bn for immigration enforcement-related activities and personnel.\nYet even as ICE now has the funds to hire about 14,000 new employees, its efforts to quickly do so have raised red flags among everyday citizens disgusted by the recruitment ads themselves and experts concerned that the speed and tone with which the federal government is pursuing new agents could attract more aggressive, combat-hungry applicants.\n“They’re aiming for that sweet spot of people who’ve got something to prove, who want to have that power, under the guise of patriotism,” Americus Reed, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, told the Post.\nICE’s controversial ads have leaned heavily on American symbolism – Uncle Sam, George Washington, Lady Liberty – while casting immigrants as bad actors to convince potential deportation officers to apply.\nMeanwhile, ICE is offering an up to $50,000 signing bonus, higher than the real median personal income for a year’s work in the US, as well as up to $60,000 in student loan repayment for those who join.\nThe agency has already received more than 220,000 applications and made more than 18,000 tentative job offers, sometimes on the spot. At an ICE recruitment fair in Arlington, Texas, more than a hundred people were waiting outside before the event started. Attenders told the New York Times they were there because they were “very patriotic” and committed to “guarding the homeland”.\n“When I saw Uncle Sam pointing that finger, I just had it in my heart,” Mahin Ahmed, an ICE applicant, told the Times. “You’re thinking, ‘Look at this guy. He’s an immigrant. He wants to become a deportation officer.’ It doesn’t make any sense to you, makes 100 percent sense to me.”\nWith more ICE officers available, the White House border czar, Tom Homan, said that the number of immigrant arrests will “explode” in 2026, including through an increase in enforcement at workplaces, Reuters reported.\nHoman’s comments came after the administration had signaled it would instead be toning down its public-facing immigration actions to focus on apprehending people with serious criminal convictions, in the face of widespread backlash to its violent and highly visible tactics in major cities around the country.\nAlready, ICE held a record number of people – 68,440 – in detention in recent weeks, the vast majority with no criminal conviction. But the administration remained far below its goal of a million deportations in its first year, with about 300,000 removals since Trump’s second inauguration.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/ice-recruitment-media-campaign", "published_at": "2025-12-31T21:52:09+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Now, its successor – the swipeable MetroCard, which lasted barely more than three decades – has seen its demise.\nAt midnight on 1 January, the flexible credit card-sized pass used by millions of New Yorkers to get through subway turnstiles is being terminated from sale just as a new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, takes office.\nThe transit system will fully transition to Omny, a contactless payment system that allows riders to tap their credit card, phone or other smart device to pay fares, much as they do for other purchases.\nBut the end of the MetroCard has brought mixed feelings. The unlimited ride, 30-day option made travelers feel like kings or queens of the city, swiping around at will, seemingly free to travel the length and breadth of the metro system, surfacing on a whim.\nThere were drawbacks – the MetroCard’s notoriously sensitive magnetic strip could fail to read, abruptly halting the progress of the rider into the turnstile gate, forcing them to reverse to try again.\nToo many cards, too, could cause problems and delays, as straphangers swiped each one vainly for a valid fare until one worked, or it was back to vending machine for a refill or a brand-new card.\nAt its inception in 1994, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) launched public campaigns to teach commuters how to swipe the originally blue-colored cards correctly after the previous brass token was phased out.\nJodi Shapiro, curator at the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn, which opened an exhibit earlier this month reflecting on the MetroCard’s legacy, told the Associated Press that the MetroCard was revolutionary in its day.\n“There was a resistance to change from tokens to something else because tokens work,” Shapiro said. “MetroCards introduced a whole other level of thinking for New Yorkers”.\nThe MetroCard also became a vehicle for promotions, with the city issuing commemorative editions, including one to mark baseball’s home team World Series between the New York Mets and the New York Yankees in the 2000.\nDavid Bowie, Olivia Rodrigo, the Wu-Tang Clan, the Notorious BIG and LL Cool J also graced the card over the years, as did New York TV shows such as Seinfeld and Law & Order.\nThe MetroCard required a certain technique to use, demanding a special angle of attack and velocity through the turnstile sensor to be read correctly – a learned technique that separated New Yorkers from interlopers.\nDuring her failed 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton, a former US senator from New York, took an excruciating five swipes at a Bronx turnstile before finding success. Her progressive Democratic opponent at the time, US senator Bernie Sanders, a native Brooklynite, didn’t even appear to realize brass tokens had been swapped out for the MetroCard when he tried.\nThe unlimited card was also a way to extend charity to fellow New Yorkers without a fare since travelers exiting the subways system could swipe another in at no cost.\nThe New York Times reported that a symbolic funeral for the disappearing MetroCard was held in Manhattan’s Washington Square Park on Tuesday. A few dozen attended, it said, some chanting “swipe, swipe” to commemorate its passing into technological history, according to CBS News film from the ceremony.\n“The MetroCard was there when we was broke, when we were late, when we squeezed into the train with one swipe left and that hope, that hope in our hearts,” Dupree God, who helped organize the MetroCard send-off, told Spectrum 1 News.\nKaicey Rahn said that the MetroCard, which will still be accepted – but not sold – until sometime in 2026, would be remembered as a kind of companion during late-night excursions around the city.\n“Who do we call?” Rahn said. “We call the MetroCard. And now we’ll be reminded of his absence every time we go on the train.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/new-york-city-metrocard-retired", "published_at": "2025-12-31T21:38:09+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Send them back from where they came, Somalia, perhaps the worst, and most corrupt, country on earth.”\nThe president continued: “Tim Waltz of Minnesota is a Crooked Governor!!!” and sought to tie California in with his criticism of Minnesota.\n“There is more FRAUD in California than there is in Minnesota, if that is even possible,” he wrote. “When you add in Election Fraud, then they are tied for first. Two Crooked Governors, two Crooked States!”\nTrump’s inflammatory missives came hours after Walz slammed the administration’s decision to freeze childcare payments to the state, saying on X that Trump is “using an issue he doesn’t give a damn about as an excuse to hurt working Minnesotans”.\nWalz said that the decision announced late Tuesday by Jim O’Neill, deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, to stall childcare payments to the state amid increased allegations of fraud within its social services programs, was a political ruse.\n“This is Trump’s long game,” Walz wrote Tuesday in a post on the social platform X. “We’ve spent years cracking down on fraudsters. It’s a serious issue – but this has been his plan all along. He’s politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans.”\nThe dispute centers in part on alleged fraud at Minneapolis’s Somali American childcare centers exposed by YouTuber Nick Shirley over the Christmas break. Shirley posted video of himself confronting workers at state-supported daycare centers over an apparent lack of enrolled children.\nBut the video, which has been viewed more than 100m times, has been criticized for falsely presenting as new allegations of fraud schemes that were already known to exist during the Biden administration.\nThe issue has provided a potent political cudgel for Trump and senior figures in the administration. On Tuesday, JD Vance wrote on X that the move to suspend childcare payments are some of the “most important steps we can take to end the fraud in Minnesota”.\nThe justice department claims to have charged 98 people in connection with the sweeping fraud case, which concerns businesses that falsely billed programs under the Minnesota department of human services (MDHS), since 2022. Most of the defendants are Somali Americans, prosecutors have said.\nJustice department officials have said that “half or more” of the $18bn billed to 14 services under the MDHS since 2018 is fraudulent, but court records reviewed by the Minnesota Star Tribune indicate that the alleged fraud is closer to $218m.\nO’Neill said in a video statement that the funding freeze was in response to what he called “blatant fraud that appears to be rampant in Minnesota and across the country … We have turned off the money spigot and we are finding the fraud.”\nThe alleged fraud in Minnesota, put at $9bn by some estimates, is a small fraction of the total estimates of Covid relief money that went missing or was misspent, estimated at around $400bn by the Associated Press in 2023.\nStill, it has provided an opportunity for Trump, as part of a larger administration push against immigrant entitlements, to ramp up his feud against Walz and Omar. Omar has urged people not to blame an entire community for the actions of a relative few and spoken out against ICE raids in Minneapolis.\nEarlier this month, Omar called Operation Metro Surge “state-sanctioned racial profiling used as a tool of political intimidation. But Somali Minnesotans aren’t intimidated. We’re brave and resilient, and our neighbors have our back.

Talwani’s injunction had blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a provision of its massive tax-and-spending bill that blocks Planned Parenthood from receiving reimbursements from Medicaid, the US government’s health insurance program for low-income people, in the 22 states.\nThe panel’s decision is only the latest legal volley in the months-long war over the Trump administration’s provision. The appeals court previously lifted another order by Talwani in a separate case, brought by Planned Parenthood, that had also blocked the measure’s enforcement.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, called the Tuesday ruling disappointing but said he remained committed to “ensuring vulnerable Californians can access the healthcare they need”. Bonta, a Democrat, co-led the case with his counterparts from Connecticut and New York.\nPlanned Parenthood did not respond to a request for comment.\nRepublicans in Congress passed the provision as part of their One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Specifically, it bars Medicaid funding for tax-exempt organizations that provide family planning and reproductive health services if they perform abortions and received more than $800,000 in Medicaid funds during the 2023 fiscal year.\nPlanned Parenthood says the provision was passed with it in mind and has contributed to at least 20 of its health centers closing since Trump signed the measure into law in July. The reproductive healthcare giant has warned that the measure could ultimately lead up to 200 health centers to close. Because most of those centers are located in blue states that still permit abortion, their closure could dramatically curtail access to the procedure. The measure, advocates have said, amounts to a “back-door abortion ban”.\nIt is already broadly illegal to pay for abortions using federal dollars. Instead, Planned Parenthood uses Medicaid reimbursements to fund services such as STI tests, cancer screenings and the provision of contraception. In 2024, Planned Parenthood centers treated people who rely on Medicaid with more than 1.5m visits.\nIf those people can no longer go to Planned Parenthood for reproductive health services, experts say they will probably be left with nowhere to turn.\nAfter the first circuit earlier this year paused Talwani’s initial injunction in Planned Parenthood’s favor, a group of Democratic attorneys general asked her to block the law’s enforcement again, but on different grounds.\nTalwani, who was appointed by Barack Obama, agreed to do so on 2 December, saying the states were likely to succeed in establishing that the law constitutes an unconstitutional retroactive condition on their participation in the Medicaid program.\nTalwani held that the law did not give the states clear notice as to which entities it covered and imposed a restriction they could not have anticipated after the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved their state Medicaid plans.\nBut on Tuesday, the first circuit panel – comprising only judges appointed by Democratic presidents – said the Trump administration had demonstrated it was likely to prevail on appeal in establishing the law was not ambiguous and that Congress had the power to make such changes.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/planned-parenthood-medicaid-funding-ends", "published_at": "2025-12-31T18:07:41+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

He is seeking to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive – a way for the Trump administration to punish him for the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.\nTo support that argument, he has asked the government to turn over documents that reveal how the decision was made to prosecute him in 2025 for an incident that occurred in 2022. On 3 December, US district judge Waverly Crenshaw filed an order under seal that compelled the government to provide some documents to Ábrego García and his attorneys. That order was unsealed on Tuesday and sheds new light on the case.\nEarlier, Crenshaw found that there was “some evidence” that the prosecution of Ábrego García could be vindictive. He specifically cited a statement by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged Ábrego García because he had won his wrongful deportation case.\nRob McGuire, who was the acting US attorney for the middle district of Tennessee until late December, argued that those statements were irrelevant because he alone made the decision to prosecute, and he has no animus against Ábrego García.\nIn the newly unsealed order, Crenshaw writes: “Some of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in [the justice department] and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision.”\nThe US attorney’s office for the middle district of Tennessee released a statement saying: “The emails cited in Judge Crenshaw’s order, specifically Mr McGuire’s email on May 15, 2025, confirm that the ultimate decision on whether to prosecute was made by career prosecutors based on the facts, evidence, and established [justice department] practice. Communications with the Deputy Attorney General’s Office about a high-profile case are both required and routine.”\nThe email referenced was from McGuire to his staff stating that Blanche “would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later”, according to Crenshaw’s order.\nThe human-smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee during which Ábrego García was pulled over for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and state troopers discussed the possibility of human smuggling among themselves. However, he was ultimately allowed to leave with only a warning. The case was turned over to Homeland Security Investigations, but there is no record of any effort to charge him until April 2025, according to court records.\nThe order does not give much detail on what is in the documents that were turned over to Ábrego García, but it shows that Aakash Singh, who works under Blanche in the office of the deputy attorney general, contacted McGuire about Ábrego García’s case on 27 April, the same day that McGuire received a file on the case from Homeland Security Investigations. That was several days after the US supreme court ruled in Ábrego García’s favor on 10 April.\nOn 30 April, Singh said in an email to McGuire that the prosecution was a “top priority” for the deputy attorney general’s office, according to the order. Singh and McGuire continued to communicate about the prosecution. On 18 May, Singh wrote to McGuire and others to hold the draft indictment until they got “clearance” to file it. “The implication is that ‘clearance’ would come from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,” Crenshaw writes.\nA hearing on the motion to dismiss the case on the basis of vindictive prosecution is scheduled for 28 January.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/kilmar-abrego-garcia-retaliation-deportation", "published_at": "2025-12-31T17:29:35+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Artists have cancelled bookings and members of Congress have vowed to overturn the name change. Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, is even suing to reverse it on the grounds that changing the center’s name requires an act of Congress.\nTrump took over as chair of the board in February, quickly purging sitting members, while installing his supporters – including his longtime foreign policy adviser Ric Grenell, whom he appointed as president of the center. Grenell had been a vocal tribune of Trump’s “America First” ideology, and was not afraid to ruffle feathers during past spells as ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence (he was the first openly gay person to lead the intelligence community).\nJust prior to his Kennedy Center appointment, Grenell served as the president’s envoy for special missions, and was involved in securing the release of Americans detained in Venezuela.\nThe center lists 34 presidentially appointed board members and 23 ex-officio members, who by law must include the mayor of Washington DC, head of the library of Congress, and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate. The federal law underpinning the center’s establishment identified ex-officio members as among the venue’s trustees, charged with maintaining it as a memorial to President John F Kennedy, the Post reported.\nRoma Daravi, the center’s vice-president for public relations, told the Post that the rules had been changed in line with longstanding convention that ex-officio members did not vote: “The bylaws were revised to reflect this longstanding precedent and everyone received the technical changes both before the meeting and after revisions.”\nDaravi continued: “Some members (including ex officio) attended in person, others by phone, and no concerns were voiced, no one objected, and the bylaws passed unanimously.”\nEllen Aprill, a legal scholar at UCLA, told the paper that such voting right limits breached the center’s charter.\n“Clearly the intent of the charter provisions was to entrust Kennedy Center guidance to a broad group, not just those appointed by the president,” she said.\nThe disclosure comes as new figures showed a sharp fall in television ratings for this year’s Kennedy Center honors awards. A record low audience of 3.01m watched this year’s broadcast of the annual honors awards – hosted by Trump himself – when it was screened by CBS, marking a stark 25% downturn from last year. The event included appearances from some of Trump’s favorite artists, including Gloria Gaynor, Kiss and George Strait.\nAs artists cancel bookings, Trump on social media on Tuesday posted a string of statements from supporters criticizing the Kennedy family’s supposed lack of support for the center. His posts on his Truth Social network started mere hours after the Kennedy family announced the death of Tatiana Schlossberg, JFK’s granddaughter, who died aged 35, from leukemia.\nThe Guardian has contacted the Kennedy Center for comment.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/trump-kennedy-center", "published_at": "2025-12-31T16:29:03+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Vendors selling everything from chai to embroidered Palestinian handicrafts turned out to support the fundraiser; a DJ blasted music and artists painted children’s faces with the colours of Halloween.\nI chose the vendor with the most protein on offer because I lift and squat more than my bodyweight and must meet a daily goal. “Our kebab is one of Zohran’s favourites,” the man at the King of Kebab stand told me, proudly and unprompted, as he piled my plate with meat.\nI had not asked him anything about the mayoral race but I knew exactly who he meant, because like Cher, Madonna, Beyoncé and Björk, our mayor-elect is simply Zohran to many of us. And not because we can’t pronounce his family name – I’m looking at you Andrew Cuomo and all who seem to deliberately mangle “Mamdani”. In New York City, and everywhere else I’ve been, 2025 was the year when everybody learned his name. And after he is sworn in today on the steps of City Hall – followed by a party for 40,000 in Lower Manhattan – 2026 will be the year of Zohran.\nI’ve been a New Yorker for 23 years. During that time, I have travelled across the world to give lectures and I’ve never been asked what I think of Michael (Bloomberg), Bill (de Blasio), or Eric (Adams) – our mayors since I moved here. None of them has come close to encapsulating the arduous and necessary complication of identity that many New Yorkers feel in this city of a million Muslims. But ever since he announced his mayoral candidacy at the end of 2024, Zohran has seemed to represent something that my life has bumped up against many times since I have lived here.\nI’ve spent 19 of my 23 years in NYC in Harlem, where I live in a rent-stabilised apartment in a brownstone owned by a Black woman from the neighbourhood. Mamdani campaigned as an ally to tenants like me, vowing to freeze rent for 2 million people living in rent-stabilised apartments as part of his focus on affordability. A few weeks before we went to the polls, my landlady and I were catching up in the hall outside her apartment. “I hope you’re voting for Zohran,” she said.\nDuring my citizenship oath in NYC in 2011, we were told that in the hall for the ceremony were people from 140 countries about to become US citizens. Few other cities hold the allure of New York in the global imagination. And few other Muslims have reached Mamdani’s level of first-name celebrity status, or the ability to complicate the narrative of what a Muslim is. I am an avowed consumer of cannabis and I cheered Mamdani’s response during the mayoral debates when candidates were asked if they had ever bought marijuana, which is legal in New York. “I’ve purchased marijuana at a legal cannabis shop,” Mamdani replied, with a big cheesy grin. Fuck, yeah, Zohran!\nI moved from Egypt to Seattle in 2000, and then to New York City a year after the September 11 attacks. Soon after arriving, I found community with Muslims and we began to call ourselves progressive Muslims. Unlike me, most of them had been born and raised in the US. Those who did not wear hijabs spoke often of how the 9/11 attacks forced an unfamiliar visibility upon Muslims, who comprise less than 2% of the US population. That was especially the case for those whose families were more recent arrivals, compared to Black Muslims who have been in the country as far back as the days of enslavement. “I came out as Muslim after 9/11,” one of my new friends told me at the time, adding that his neighbours and colleagues had assumed he was Latinx. Over the years since, I have lost count of the number of “No hablo español,” that I’ve issued across the city because I’m often thought to be Dominican or Puerto Rican.\nMamdani lives in Queens, the site of the fundraiser for the Asiyah Women’s Centre. “The capital of linguistic diversity, not just for the five boroughs (of New York City), but for the human species, is Queens,” Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-Schapiro wrote in Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas. There are as many as 800 languages spoken in New York City, and nowhere in the world has more than Queens, according to the Endangered Language Alliance.\nDonald Trump, whose regime plans to ramp up efforts in 2026 to strip naturalised people of their US citizenship, is also from Queens. As is Republican New York City councilwoman Vickie Paladino, who called for the “expulsion of Muslims” in the wake of the Bondi Beach massacre. In a year when their politics had begun to feel undefeatable, Zohran’s win is a breath of hope.\nMamdani excites so many, in the US and abroad, because to co-opt and misquote Robert Frost, he is the more enticing of the two roads diverging in Queens, and across the US at the moment. He makes more urgent – and youthful – the choice to embrace social justice and reject hate and nationalism at a time when older politicians are succeeding in their bigotry and chauvinism. He will become the city’s youngest mayor since 1892, its first Muslim mayor, and its first mayor born on the African continent. It feels apt that New York is the city that first embraced him.\nThe year after I moved to New York City, my brother and his wife had a daughter – my own immediate family’s first US citizen. Ten years after I moved to NYC, I was arrested for spray painting over a racist, Islamophobic, pro-Israel advertisement in the subway. I did it because I did not want my niece and her three siblings or any other American Muslim children to be bullied or to have to choose – as the racists and Islamophobes insist – between being American and Muslim.\nAnd now, here in NYC, I can point to Zohran!\n-\nMona Eltahawy writes the FEMINIST GIANT newsletter.

Unrestrained immigration and other policies derided by administration officials as “woke”, it warns, could lead to “civilisational erasure” within a few decades.\nThat argument rests on a fundamental misreading of Europe’s current predicament. While the EU does face an existential threat, it has little to do with immigration or cultural politics. In fact, the share of foreign-born residents in the US is slightly higher than in Europe.\nThe real threat facing Europe lies in its own economic and technological backwardness. Between 2008 and 2023, GDP rose by 87% in the US, compared with just 13.5% in the EU. Over the same period, the EU’s GDP per capita fell from 76.5% of the US level to 50%. Even the poorest US state – Mississippi – has a higher per capita income than that of several major European economies, including France, Italy and the EU average.\nThis widening economic gap cannot be explained by demographics. Instead, it reflects stronger productivity growth in the US, largely owing to technological innovation and higher total factor productivity. Today, roughly half of the world’s 50 largest technology firms are American, while only four are European. Over the past five decades, 241 US firms have grown from startups into companies with market capitalisations of at least $10bn (£7.4bn), compared with just 14 in Europe.\nThese trends raise a critical question: which countries will lead the industries of the future, and where does Europe fit in? The race for technological leadership now spans a wide range of fields, including AI and machine learning, semiconductor design and production, robotics, quantum computing, fusion energy, fintech and defence technologies. Europe enters this race at a clear disadvantage.\nWhether the US or China currently leads the industries of the future remains open to debate, but most observers agree that it’s essentially a two-horse race, with the US still ahead in several key areas. Beyond that, innovation is concentrated in countries such as Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, India and Israel. In Europe, by contrast, innovative activities are largely confined to the UK, Germany, France and Switzerland – two of which are not even EU member states.\nIt is hardly a surprise, then, that while the US and China dominate global technological rankings, Europe finds itself far from the top. And the outlook is anything but reassuring, given that the next wave of innovation is widely expected to be more disruptive than anything we have seen over the past half century.\nThe technological gap between the US and Europe can be attributed to several factors. First, the US has a far deeper and more dynamic ecosystem for financing startups, while Europe still lacks a genuine capital markets union, limiting the scale and speed at which new firms can grow.\nSecond, Europe is hampered by excessive and fragmented regulation. A US startup can launch a product under a single regulatory framework and immediately access a market of more than 330 million consumers. The EU has a population of roughly 450 million but remains divided among 27 national regulatory regimes. An International Monetary Fund analysis shows that internal market barriers in the EU act like a tariff of about 44% for goods and 110% for services – far higher than the tariff levels the US imposes on most imports.\nThird, cultural attitudes toward risk-taking differ sharply. Until relatively recently, a failed entrepreneur in some EU countries (such as Italy) could face criminal penalties, while in the US, a tech founder who has never failed is often seen as too risk-averse.\nFourth, the US benefits from a deeply integrated academic-military-industrial complex, while Europe’s chronic underinvestment in defence has weakened its innovation capacity. Technological leaders such as the US, China, Israel and, more recently, Ukraine spend heavily on defence, with military research often producing technologies that have civilian applications.\nDespite this, many European political leaders continue to frame higher defence spending as a trade-off between security and social welfare. In reality, free-riding on US defence spending since the end of the second world war has limited the type of innovation that could have generated more of both through higher productivity. Paradoxically, sustaining Europe’s social model will require greater investment in defence, beginning with meeting Nato’s new spending target of 3.5% of GDP.\nIf Europe allows its technological lag to grow over the coming decades, it risks prolonged stagnation and continued economic decline relative to the US and China. There are, however, reasons for cautious optimism. Increasingly aware that Europe faces an existential challenge, policymakers have begun to advance serious reform proposals. The most notable examples are the two major 2024 reports on EU competitiveness and the single market by the former Italian prime ministers Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta respectively.\nEurope also retains considerable strengths, including high-quality human capital, excellent education systems and world-class research institutions. With the right incentives and regulatory reforms, these assets could support much higher levels of commercial innovation. With a better environment for entrepreneurship, Europe’s high per capita income, large internal market and elevated savings rates could help unleash a wave of investment.\nCrucially, even if Europe never leads in cutting-edge technologies, it could still significantly boost productivity by adopting and adapting American and Chinese innovations. Many of these technologies are general-purpose in character, benefiting both adopters and pioneers.\nAll of this leaves Europe at an inflection point. As Ernest Hemingway famously observed, bankruptcy happens “gradually and then suddenly”. So far, Europe’s technological decline has been gradual. But if it fails to confront its structural weaknesses, today’s slow erosion could give way to a sudden and irreversible loss of economic relevance.\nNouriel Roubini is professor emeritus at the Stern school of business and the author of Megathreats: Ten Dangerous Trends that Imperil Our Future and How to Survive Them.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/01/trump-woke-policies-europe-economic-technological-decline", "published_at": "2026-01-01T07:00:32+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Nicki Minaj popped up at the Turning Point USA conference to kiki with Erika Kirk and the most I could muster was “I guess she’ll do a concert at the Trump-Kennedy Center soon.”\nThe year started with the back-to-back monstrosities of the Los Angeles wildfires and the second presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. I’d say it was all downhill from there, but we’ve already rolled down, hit every tree on the way, and ended up getting mauled by a pack of hungry grizzly bears.\nProtests against ICE grew, and there was another massive No Kings event in October, but most of the year was met with groaning resignation. We act as though we just have to wait out the clock on this accursed era, like the world’s worst NBA team hopelessly tossing up three-pointers while down by 50.\nEventually, getting dunked on by LeBron James becomes tiresome. But what if, at the bottom of the restaurant dumpster that is life on Earth, there’s an unopened tin of caviar? Plus, a box of blinis, some creme fraiche, a bottle of ice cold champagne and also a lovely silver spoon. And a copy of Architectural Digest.\nThe most luxurious indulgence imaginable is being able to fixate on people and events that actually don’t matter. Back in the old days, a series of stupid things would happen during the year and we’d all have a laugh about it. Remember the Macarena? That was great. 2025 didn’t launch a dance craze on par with yuppies swiveling their hips like a broken car radio antenna in a windstorm, but we were blessed with just enough inanity to get us through a cursed year.\nLet’s start with Labubus. Doesn’t that sound nice? Little furry gremlin dolls that people who are bad with money decided to hoard like toilet paper during a mass quarantine. These dolls were everywhere, dangling from women’s purses and grinning up at us as though they pilfered the entire contents of the cash register at a Cinnabon. Labubus seemed to be the only ones smiling through 2025. Maybe they know 2026 is going to be worse.\nSydney Sweeney sparked a good old-fashioned internet outrage cycle over an ad for American Eagle jeans that was only offensive if you were hoping to be offended. A pun about “genes” and “jeans” only seems like a nod to eugenics if you specifically cast an attractive blonde lady for the ad. If I had been the spokesperson, people would have had a hearty laugh over it. “Good genes? He can barely fit into his pants!” Honestly, I chuckled at the ad anyway. Mostly because someone actually thought it was a good idea.\nSpeaking of internet outrage, Andy Byron, a tech CEO, and his head of human resources, Kristin Cabot, were caught on the kiss cam at a Coldplay concert. Cabot has subsequently gone on a press tour to convince maniacs to stop threatening her life. She claims her and Byron had not been engaged in an affair prior to the explosion of #coldplaygate. I, for one, believe her.

USA Hockey plans to announce its roster Friday morning on NBC’s “Today.” This is the first time in 12 years that NHL players will compete in the Olympics.\nThe tournament begins in Milan, Italy, on 11 February. The US are scheduled to oppose Latvia on 12 February, Denmark on 14 February and Germany on 15 February.\nThe aforementioned trio joins six players previously named to the US team – forwards Jack Eichel of the Vegas Golden Knights, Auston Matthews of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Brady Tkachuk of the Ottawa Senators and Matthew Tkachuk of the Panthers and defensemen Quinn Hughes of the Minnesota Wild and Charlie McAvoy of the Boston Bruins.\nExcept for Hughes, who was injured at the time, those players were part of the 4 Nations Face-Off team that lost to Canada in the tournament final last February in Boston.\nUnder head coach Mike Sullivan of the New York Rangers, Team USA seeks their first Olympic gold medal since the 1980 “Miracle on Ice” team won gold in Lake Placid, New York.\n“The expectation is to go to Milan and win the gold medal,” Eichel said at the US Olympic orientation camp in September. “I think anything short of that, it would be disappointing.“\nKeller, 27, is no stranger to Team USA. He served as captain at the world championships last May when the Americans earned their first gold medal at the event since 1933.\nKeller, a St Louis area native who was the No 7 overall pick of the Arizona Coyotes in 2016, posted a career-best 90 points last season and is currently tied for the Mammoth’s team scoring lead with 33 points (12 goals, 21 assists) in 40 games. Keller’s 10th NHL season has already been filled with emotions after his father, Bryan, died unexpectedly in November.\nThompson, 28, was selected No 26 overall by the St Louis Blues in 2016 and is enjoying another strong season with the Sabres, who acquired the Phoenix native in the 2018 trade that sent forward Ryan O’Reilly to the Blues.\nThompson leads the Sabres in scoring with 34 points (18 goals, 16 assists) in 38 games this season, his ninth in the NHL. He scored in overtime against Switzerland to lift Team USA to a 1-0 win in the gold-medal game at last May’s world championships.\nJones, 31, the son of former NBA player Popeye Jones, is playing in his 13th NHL season and earned his first Stanley Cup ring with the Panthers in June.\nAn Arlington, Texas, native, Jones has posted 24 points (six goals, 18 assists) this season in 39 games. He was the No 4 overall pick of the 2013 draft by the Nashville Predators and has also played for the Columbus Blue Jackets and Chicago Blackhawks.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/31/team-usa-hockey-olympics-keller-thompson-jones-milan-2026", "published_at": "2025-12-31T23:28:09+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The matter remains part of an ongoing legal process. We will respect that process, continue to monitor the situation closely, as we have over the past few months, and cooperate fully with the league. We will have no further comment at this time.”\nBarmore is the second Patriots player this week to face off-field legal scrutiny. On Tuesday, it emerged that wide receiver Stefon Diggs is facing a felony strangulation charge in connection with an alleged incident on 2 December.\nHead coach Mike Vrabel said Wednesday that Barmore did not practice due to illness and added that he had not heard “anything that would keep either player from the game”.\nAsked whether he was disappointed by the distractions surrounding Barmore and Diggs, Vrabel said: “I would say not disappointing at all. I think that these are allegations. It’s things that we have to handle. Every day there are distractions, some are smaller than others. I’m confident that we’ll focus on the Dolphins, and those two individuals will be able to handle the ongoing legal process.”\nBarmore has played in all 16 games this season, making 15 starts for the AFC East champion Patriots (13-3). He has one sack, 26 tackles and nine quarterback hits.

The 25-year-old crossed the line in 9:35.4 to secure only the second World Cup victory of his career, edging Austria’s Benjamin Moser by two-tenths of a second. Norway’s Lars Heggen finished a further four-tenths back in third.\nThe win lifted Schumacher to sixth overall in the Tour de Ski standings and capped a breakthrough performance in a discipline rarely contested on the World Cup circuit in recent years.\nLater in the day, Diggins matched the achievement on the women’s side, adding another chapter in the final season of an already decorated career. The American claimed her 31st World Cup victory in a race that unfolded less as a traditional mass start than a test of shared tempo and efficiency, with athletes rotating the lead to sustain maximum speed.\nDiggins finished well clear of Sweden’s Emma Ribom and Moa Ilar, who completed the podium, and extended her lead at the top of both the World Cup and Tour de Ski overall standings.\nBeyond the results, the day carried symbolic weight for a US team that has steadily closed the gap on traditional European powers. Julia Kern finished 10th in the women’s race for her first top-10 result of the season, while Schumacher’s win underscored a growing American presence on the men’s side.\nThe Tour de Ski continues on Thursday with the 20km pursuit races, where athletes will start according to their accumulated time deficits, chasing overall points as the series moves into the new year.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/31/us-cross-country-skiing-world-cup-double-schumacher-diggins", "published_at": "2025-12-31T18:36:23+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

He could make his debut Saturday in Baylor’s Big 12 opener at TCU.\nNnaji was the first pick of the second round, 31st overall, by the Detroit Pistons two and a half years ago. His draft rights have since been traded to Boston, then Charlotte and most recently the New York Knicks in October 2024. The 21-year-old Nnaji, who was playing in Europe before he was drafted, hasn’t been on an NBA roster. He was 18 when he was drafted.\nInternational players with varying backgrounds, including professional leagues, have played college basketball for years. With players now getting paid under name, image and likeness (NIL) deals, college teams have added players from the NBA’s developmental G League.\nThe NCAA said players wouldn’t be eligible if they signed regular NBA contracts or two-way deals that involve G League affiliates. But the association said that won’t necessarily apply to G League players without NBA deals, or other professional leagues in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n“As schools are increasingly recruiting individuals with international league experience, the NCAA is exercising discretion in applying the actual and necessary expenses bylaw to ensure that prospective student-athletes with experience in American basketball leagues are not at a disadvantage compared to their international counterparts,” NCAA president Charlie Baker said in a statement released by the association. “Rules have long permitted schools to enroll and play individuals with no prior collegiate experience midyear.”\nArkansas coach John Calipari said he wasn’t criticizing Baylor’s Scott Drew or others trying to add players amid a shifting college landscape. But he said a rule should clearly disqualify any NBA draft pick.\n“I don’t blame coaches,” Calipari said. “Let me give you this, real simple ... If you put your name in the draft – I don’t care if you’re from Russia – and you stay in the draft, you can’t play college basketball. Well, that’s only for American kids. What? If your name is in that draft and you got drafted, you can’t play, because that’s our rule. But that’s only for American kids. OK.”\nDrew defended the move by pointing to other undrafted international players who are playing college basketball right now. Nastja Claessens, a 2024 third-round WNBA draft pick, is averaging 10.6 points in 11 games for the Kansas State women this season.\n“Until we get to collective bargaining, I don’t think we can come up with rules that are agreeable or enforceable,” Drew said. “Until that, I think all of us have got to be ready to adjust and adapt to what’s out there. Early on, when it first came out with G League players, I wasn’t in favor of that either. But again, we don’t make the rules and as we find out about things, we’re always going to adapt to put our program in the best position to be successful, because that’s what we get paid to do.”\nThe NCAA said court rulings in lawsuits challenging eligibility standards are making its rules difficult to enforce. Attorneys for Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, who is suing for more eligibility, latched on to Baylor’s signing of Nnaji to try to bolster their argument.\n“While the NCAA has prevailed on the vast majority of eligibility-related lawsuits, recent outlier decisions enjoining the NCAA on a nationwide basis from enforcing rules that have been on the books for decades – without even having a trial – are wildly destabilizing,” Baker said in the statement. “I will be working with D-I leaders in the weeks ahead to protect college basketball from these misguided attempts to destroy this American institution.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/31/ncaa-eligibility-nba-contracts-baylor-james-nnaji", "published_at": "2025-12-31T18:12:04+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Now here was the US president, on a rare visit, examining the project for himself.\n“It looks like it’s about $3.1bn. It went up a little bit – or a lot,” Trump said, as Jerome Powell, the typically calm Fed chair, vigorously shook his head. “So the $2.7bn is now $3.1bn–”\n“I’m not aware of that, Mr President,” Powell quickly interjected, as Trump pulled out a paper from his suit pocket as evidence. “I haven’t heard that from anybody at the Fed.”\nThe remarkable public encounter in late July was described as a “tussle”, “spar” and “feud” by news outlets and came to symbolize an extraordinary battle for control of the world’s largest economy.\nNever before has a president been so publicly, and relentlessly, critical of the country’s top monetary policymaker. For decades, successive administrations have allowed the Fed, as the institution tasked with steering the US economy, to function independently, without political interference. No longer.\nTrump, who later embarked upon a vast construction of his own, with the surprise demolition of the entire East Wing of the White House for a new ballroom, continues to threaten legal action over the Fed renovations, and direct seemingly unlimited anger toward Powell.\nFew believe this historic test of the central bank’s independence has run its course. In fact, it is widely expected to intensify in the coming months.\n“The institution was built to withstand a moment like this,” said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist. “Some of the battle lines were drawn, but we haven’t seen this play all the way out.”\n‘The president should at least have a say’\nThe US economy has had a rollercoaster year. Trump’s widespread tariffs and crackdown on immigration destabilized prices and the labor market – the two domains the Fed aims to protect, and balance, by setting interest rates. Higher interest rates can calm inflation, but also risk raising unemployment. Lowering rates can stimulate economic growth, but risk higher prices.\nAt the beginning of the year, it looked like the Fed had achieved a so-called “soft landing”: inflation had fallen significantly from the 40-year high it scaled in 2022, during the feverish post-pandemic economy, but the labor market had remained broadly stable. Interest rates went from near zero to 5.25% to 5.5%.\nWall Street was nevertheless anxious for rates to come down. On the campaign trail, Trump had made clear that he would want a say over how things are run at the Fed, and repeatedly suggested that he would pressure the central bank to lower rates.\n“I feel the president should at least have say in there. I feel that strongly,” he said in August 2024. “In my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in my cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve, or the chairman.”\n‘Too Late Powell’\nOnce he retook office, Trump’s laser focus on lowering rates only intensified. When his “Liberation Day” tariff announcement in April caused stock markets to plummet, he raged against the Fed for not acting quick enough.\n“If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” Trump said of Powell in mid-April. Markets did not respond kindly to the threat, and Trump eventually said that Powell’s job was safe.\nIt was the beginning, however, of what would be a long summer of presidential attacks against the Fed. Trump continued to blast “Too Late Powell” on social media, and attempted to draw the central bank’s renovations into the spotlight.\nOnce it was clear those strategies weren’t working, the White House changed course. In August, when Trump announced he would fire Lisa Cook, a Biden-appointed Fed governor and member of the rate-setting federal open market committee.\nBill Pulte, a close ally of Trump and head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates mortgages, alleged that Cook had committed mortgage fraud. She had purportedly listed two homes as her primary residence, which could get her a better mortgage rate.\nCook, whose term ends in 2038, has since sued the White House to keep her role. The case will ultimately be determined next year by the supreme court, which temporarily blocked Cook’s firing. Her lawyers are arguing the president needs demonstrated “cause” to fire a Fed governor, and that the fraud allegations come from “cherrypicking” facts.\n‘No risk-free path’\nWhile the highly anticipated decision on Trump’s bid to fire Cook will have sweeping consequences for his campaign to exert great control over the Fed, he is also preparing to pick Powell’s replacement as Fed chair.\nEarlier this year, the supreme court mentioned the Fed in a separate ruling in which it allowed Trump to fire two members of independent labor boards. In its decision, the court said: “The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.”\nThe suggestion that the court views the Fed differently compared to other federal agencies provides some hope to allies of Cook, and proponents of central banking independence, but it’s still unclear how the justices will ultimately rule.\nThe White House is “testing the defense”, Sahm said. “Some have held up, and some may not. It’s a pressure campaign.”\nBut the Fed has so far remained stoic in face of the White House’s assaults, and Wall Street still appears confident in the Fed’s policymaking – essential for the stability of markets.\n“The Fed is always a political lightning rod. When things go wrong, the Fed is the first to blame. They get a lot of criticism when things aren’t going right, and they don’t get a lot of praise when things are going well,” said Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics.\nBut Trump’s attacks have largely “fallen on deaf ears”, added Sweet. “I don’t think it had any influence on what they did this year with regards to monetary policy.”\nIn the fall, the Fed started to lower rates, but Powell made it clear that the move was taken out of caution for risks in the labor market. “There is no risk-free path” for the central bank, Powell said in both his October and December press conferences.\nCould tension pick up in the new year?\nRates are now sitting at a range of 3.5% to 3.75%, almost 2% lower than two years ago. While the White House has softened against the Fed in recent months, tension could pick up in the new year.\nTrump said that he wants to see interest rates go down to 1%, but new projections from Fed officials suggest that most of the 12 voting members in the rate-setting committee don’t expect much change to rates in the next year.\n“We’ve now gotten to a place where the risks of [inflation and unemployment] are what we think are broadly, roughly, in balance,” Powell said in December.\nStill adamant to lower rates, Trump has instead focused on picking a new chair to replace Powell, whose term as chair is up at the end of May 2026. In recent weeks, he appears to have narrowed his focus on “Two Kevins”: Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who Trump says “thinks you have to lower rates”, and Kevin Hassett, current director of the National Economic Council and a staunch Trump loyalist.\nTrump said that the next Fed chair should listen to the president. “Typically, that’s not done any more,” he told the Wall Street Journal. “I don’t think he should do exactly what we say, but certainly we’re – I’m a smart voice and should be listened to.’\nEconomists are mixed on the impact a new Trump-appointed Fed chair can have on overall decision making. The chair is just one vote among 12 on rates, but a Fed chair is also the face of the Fed. Though other officials speak publicly, and frequently espouse their views on the economy, the chair has the biggest microphone, and sets the tone.\n“If there are any cracks in the Fed’s independence, it will spread very, very quickly,” Sweet said. “That’s going to really affect market and inflation expectations … So it’s actually counter to what the White House wants.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/31/federal-reserve-trump", "published_at": "2025-12-31T14:00:13+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The wider all-share market was 19.75% higher.\nThe precious metal producer Fresnillo was the top performer – its shares have soared by 450% in 2025, boosted by record prices for gold and silver. Its rival, Endeavour Mining, gained 170%. The telecommunications company Airtel Africa was the second-fastest riser, up 210%.\nDefence company stocks also surged as Europe boosted its spending on weapons amid the Russia-Ukraine war and pressure from Donald Trump on Nato allies to spend more on defence.\nBabcock International, the defence contractor which kits out the Royal Navy’s nuclear submarine fleet, jumped by almost 150% this year. Rolls-Royce, which supplies engines for fighter jets, turbines and propulsion systems for warships and power systems for the British army, doubled in value.\nOn Tuesday, the FTSE 100 hit a new intraday record high of 9,954 points, but fell short of breaking through the 10,000-point mark for the first time.\nMore than a fifth of the stocks on the FTSE 100 went down. The biggest fallers were the distribution company Bunzl and drinks maker Diageo. Both lost a third of their value.\nWorld stocks rallied by 21%, their strongest year since 2019 and the sixth annual rise in the past seven years.\nIt was a turbulent year for global markets, however. In January, the launch of the Chinese chatbot DeepSeek wiped $1tn from US technology stocks in a “Sputnik moment” for the world’s AI superpowers.\nThe bigger shock came on 2 April, when Trump announced sweeping tariffs on trading partners. The ensuing market panic knocked 10% off the FTSE 100 by mid-April, but there was a recovery rally when the US president decided to pause the new levies.\nToward the end of the year, hopes for US interest rate cuts in 2026 pushed shares higher, with Trump signalling that he would appoint a new head of the Federal Reserve who would lower borrowing costs.\n“Investors have been looking beyond the usual suspects for value and diversification as the US dollar came under pressure and the world continued to be beset with geopolitical turmoil and fears of an AI bubble,” said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.\nDespite the lingering fears of an AI bubble, Wall Street’s S&P 500 was on track to record a 17% rise for 2025, while the Nasdaq was about 21% up. Among tech stocks, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has gained 65% in 2025 as its Gemini artificial intelligence product gained market share.\nMeta, which owns Facebook, lagged behind with a 13% rise, while online retailer Amazon gained only 6%.\nAnxiety over the US economy, and three interest rate cuts since September, pushed the US dollar down by 9% in 2025, its worst year since 2017. Wall Street analysts expect further losses over the next 12 months.\nFears of currency debasement drove a sharp rally in precious metals this year.

Ministers hope to cut prices partly through a large increase in clean power generation, but also by shifting so-called policy costs into general taxation, to help provide an incentive to use cleaner electricity over gas.\nIn November’s budget, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said household energy bills in Great Britain would fall by £154 on average from April as a result of two changes.\nThe first was ending the energy company obligation scheme, through which suppliers funded household energy-saving measures. The second was a 75% decrease in the amount households contributed to the renewables obligation scheme, which subsidises clean power generation.\nHowever, households will also face higher bills to pay for £28bn in upgrades to the UK’s gas and electricity grids. These are expected to add £108 a year to bills by 2031.\nMinisters are planning to announce incentives for low carbon technology in homes in the new year as part of the reshaped £13bn warm homes plan. Officials say the plan will focus on getting clean technology such as plug-in solar panels into people’s houses, rather than paying for home insulation schemes.\nThey also hope to do more to bring down the cost of electricity versus gas, in an effort to encourage more people to switch to using heat pumps to keep their homes warm – although ministers are understood to have ruled out a levy on gas boilers.\nThe government has also announced it will introduce a framework for how levies should be applied in the future, with industry sources lobbying heavily for a shift away from piling costs on bills, moving them on to general taxation instead.\nJack Richardson, the head of policy at Octopus Energy, said: “The autumn budget delivered the biggest push in 20 years to cut regressive energy taxes that hold back net zero. These cuts will help the fuel poorest most. But there is still more to do, starting with the new levy control framework committed to in the budget.”\nCraig Lowrey, Cornwall Insight’s principal consultant, said the budget measures to reduce bills were “a step towards the government’s £300 reduction target by 2030, and will ease some pressure on both families and policymakers”. But, he added, the government still had a politically tricky course ahead.\n“We need to be clear – costs aren’t vanishing, they’re shifting. Moving the renewables obligation from bills to taxation may feel like a win, but ultimately, it’s still going to be paid by the public,” he said.\n“The transition to net zero isn’t cheap, but it’s the only route to genuinely lower bills in the long term.”\nThe price cap, which is updated quarterly, is also affected by wholesale gas prices and other policies. Cornwall Insight said that households would benefit from slightly lower prices after US gas producers increased supplies in recent weeks, and gas usage in Europe was lower than expected thanks to a milder winter.\nThe price cap remains well above where it was before 2022, when Russia’s full-scale of Ukraine prompted a global energy crisis. Optimism that some form of peace deal may be approaching may also have helped to temper wholesale gas prices, Cornwall said.\nChanges to grid cost forecasts also helped to lower the cap. The price cap does not apply to Northern Ireland.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/dec/31/typical-households-would-save-138-a-year-under-forecast-drop-in-energy-price-cap", "published_at": "2025-12-31T13:37:10+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

That would represent a 16% decline from the final quarter of 2024.\nThe estimates suggested that Tesla would deliver 1.64m cars in 2025 as a whole, down from 1.79m in 2024. Deliveries are then estimated to rise to 1.75m in 2026 and 3m in 2029.\nMusk claimed at a shareholder meeting in November that the company was aiming to produce 4m cars a year by the end of 2027.\nTesla’s shares are valued at $1.4tn (£1.04tn), making it worth more than the next 30 carmakers combined despite its output being less than a fifth of that of Japan’s Toyota. Musk’s Tesla shares, as well as his stake in the rocket company SpaceX, have made him by far the world’s richest man, with a fortune estimated at $623bn, according to Bloomberg.\nHowever, much of Tesla’s valuation has been based on shareholder hopes that Musk will lead the carmaker to become the global leader in self-driving technology and robotics more generally.\nWhen it comes to actual sales, Tesla has endured a tough year in part thanks to distaste among some consumers for Musk’s embrace of rightwing politics.\nIn 2024, Musk was the biggest donor to the election campaign of Donald Trump and then launched an effort to cut government spending with the Department of Government Efficiency (or Doge). His alliance with the US president did not survive the summer, with Trump instead scrapping buyer subsidies worth $7,500 a vehicle and slashing supportive regulations for electric cars.\nThe estimates published by Tesla this week are lower than other compilers have suggested. An average of forecasts by investment banks compiled by Bloomberg suggested that Tesla would deliver 440,907 vehicles in the fourth quarter.\nInvestment banks often publish sales and profit forecasts for large companies in order to judge the prospects for share price movements. “Missing” consensus forecasts often result in share price declines, and vice versa for a “beat”.\nThe forecasts for later years are also far below Musk’s stated targets. In November, Musk said the carmaker was trying to increase production by 50% by the end of 2026, and to produce 4m cars by the end of 2027, according to a transcript compiled by AlphaSense, a data company. However, the forecasts suggest the carmaker will hit the 3m mark only in 2029.\nTesla shareholders in November approved a $1tn compensation plan for Musk, in part on the basis of Tesla delivering 20m cars. Of those cars, 10m will have to have active subscriptions for “full self-driving”, its autonomous software, in order for Musk to qualify for the payment.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/31/tesla-surprise-announcement-lower-sales-2025", "published_at": "2025-12-31T16:24:57+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The company’s customer service team told the FT that the recent government shutdown had disrupted shipments.\nThe T1 smartphone, described by the company as “proudly American”, was initially promoted as a US-made rival to devices from Apple and Samsung. Almost all smartphones sold in the US are made overseas, primarily in China and South Korea but also increasingly in India and Vietnam.\nEtched with an American flag, the T1 was initially promised in August and the website still states it will be released “later this year”. Customers are required to pay a $100 payment to pre-order the device.\nThe T1 launch came shortly after Trump criticised Apple over its plans to move the production of iPhones destined for the US market from China to India.\nIt remains unclear who could manufacture the T1 handset, given the low levels of domestic smartphone production in the US.\nTrump Mobile also offers a phone contract costing $47.45 monthly, with the name of the service plan and the price referencing Trump’s status as the 47th US president.\nThe company has also recently started selling secondhand smartphones from Apple and Samsung on its website, which it states come “without the inflated price tag”.\nHowever, a refurbished iPhone 15, which was launched in September 2023, costs $629 (£467) through Trump Mobile, whereas customers can buy a newer model, an iPhone 16 from 2024, directly from Apple for $699. A Samsung Galaxy S24 is being sold for $459, slightly lower than the $489 listed on Samsung’s US website.\nThe phone venture is headed by Trump’s sons Donald Jr and Eric, who took over the family company after their father transitioned to his second presidency.\nThe mobile service joins Trump-branded watches, footwear and Bibles as products capitalising on his political brand, while Trump’s sons have indicated there will be more to come.\nThe Trump Organization has expanded from real estate into digital media and telecommunications. The venture will operate through licensing deals that generated more than $8m for the president in 2024, according to financial disclosures.\nThe move into phones also raises questions about conflicts of interest, as the president’s family business operates in a sector that is heavily regulated by federal agencies over which Trump wields executive power.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/trump-family-business-delays-launch-of-gold-smartphone", "published_at": "2025-12-31T12:59:21+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

It is also a decade since another key moment in climate justice, when a state was ordered for the first time to cut its carbon emissions faster to protect its citizens from climate change. The Urgenda case, which was upheld by the Netherlands’ supreme court in 2019, was one of the first rumblings of a wave of climate litigation around the world that campaigners say has resulted in a new legal architecture for climate protection.\nOver the past 12 months, there have been many more important rulings and tangible changes on climate driven by legal action.\nRosebank and Jackdaw approval ruled illegal\nThe year started with a bang when UK government approval of the Rosebank and Jackdaw oil and gas fields in the North Sea was ruled illegal by the Scottish court of session, because it did not account for greenhouse gas emissions caused by burning the extracted fossil fuels.\nThe judgment relied heavily on a 2024 supreme court ruling in a climate case brought by campaigner Sarah Finch. That ruling also led the high court to throw out planning permission for a new coalmine in Whitehaven, Cumbria, after which the company withdrew its plans.\nThe government published new guidance in June on how these assessments should be undertaken, although the ruling does not automatically prevent regulators from approving fossil fuel projects once they have fully analysed their impacts.\nEquinor published a revised environmental assessment of Rosebank in October and a decision on approval is imminent. The government has hinted that it may give consent again, and Greenpeace has vowed further legal action if that happens.\nPlans to build Brazil’s largest coal plant scrapped\nCivil society organisations have been campaigning for years against a coalmine and power plant in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul planned by the coal company Copelmi. If it had gone ahead, it would have been the largest coal plant in Brazil.\nThe groups argued that the Nova Seival plant and Guaíba mine breached Brazil’s climate obligations, and that the licensing process had not been undertaken properly. In 2022, a court suspended the licences and set out requirements for how the process should be revised. But in February this year, Copelmi formally withdrew its plans, saying the project had become unfeasible.\nGerman court opens door for climate damages claims\nOn the face of it, it sounds like a failure that a German court rejected a climate case brought by a Peruvian farmer and mountain guide against German energy company RWE.\nSaúl Luciano Lliuya had sought 0.47% of the overall cost of building flood defences to protect his home from a melting glacier, a proportion equivalent to RWE’s contribution to global emissions.\nBut the decade-old case had always been a stretch, and in reality it set a potentially important precedent on polluters’ liability for their carbon emissions.\nSo it was not a surprise when later in the year a group of Pakistani farmers whose livelihoods were devastated by floods three years ago fired the starting shot in a new legal claim against two of Germany’s most polluting companies.\nEnergyAustralia settles greenwashing lawsuit with parents\nIn May, EnergyAustralia settled a greenwashing lawsuit brought by a group of Australian parents.\nClimate action group Parents for Climate claimed EnergyAustralia breached Australian Consumer Law when promoting electricity and gas products because the carbon offsets used to secure certification were not backed by meaningful reductions in emissions.\nAs part of the settlement, the utility company acknowledged that carbon offsets do not prevent or undo damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions and apologised to 400,000 customers who were part of the scheme.\nIt was the first case in the country to be brought against a company for marketing itself as carbon neutral.\nInternational courts issue landmark climate opinions\nTwo international courts issued landmark advisory opinions on climate change in July.\nFirst was the inter-American court of human rights, which found that there is a human right to a healthy climate and states have a duty to protect it. This was closely followed by the international court of justice, which said countries must prevent harm to the climate system and that failing to do so could result in their having to pay compensation and make other forms of restitution.\nThe two documents are already being referenced in climate lawsuits around the world. And attempts were made to use them as leverage during climate talks in Brazil last month, although this proved more difficult than anticipated.\nNew South Wales coalmine expansion annulled\nApproval for the largest coalmine expansion in New South Wales was annulled in July because the state’s independent planning commission did not take into account the project’s full greenhouse gas emissions.\nDenman Aberdeen Muswellbrook Scone Healthy Environment Group, working with the Environmental Defenders Office, filed the case in 2023, arguing MACH Energy’s Mount Pleasant Optimisation coal mining project near Muswellbrook would worsen climate change and threaten a unique species of legless lizard.\nThe court of appeal said the commission failed to account for “scope 3” emissions when the coal is exported and burned overseas.\nApple scales back carbon neutrality claims\nIn August, a Frankfurt court ruled that Apple was not allowed to call its Apple Watch “carbon neutral”.\nIt agreed with German NGO Deutsche Umwelthilfe that the company could not demonstrate long-term carbon neutrality because the claim was based on funding eucalyptus groves in Paraguay, leases for which expire soon.\nApple is trying to get a similar greenwashing case against it in the US dismissed.\nA few months later, tech news websites noticed that Apple had stopped marketing its newly launched watches as carbon neutral in other countries too.\nHawaii to cut transport emissions after lawsuit\nLast year, Hawaii agreed to settle a lawsuit by 13 young people, represented by Our Children’s Trust, who said it was breaching their rights with infrastructure that contributes to climate change.\nThe settlement acknowledged the constitutional rights of Hawaii youth to a life-sustaining climate, and the state promised to develop a roadmap to achieve zero emissions for its ground, sea and inner island air transportation systems by 2045.\nIn October, it delivered. The energy security and waste reduction plan includes new electric vehicle chargers, investments in public and active transport, and efforts to sequester carbon through native reforestation. It will be updated annually.\nCampaigners called the plan a “critical milestone”.\nCampaigners put end to coal power plant in Kenya\nEnvironmental campaigners won a key climate case challenging approval of a coal power plant in Lamu, on Kenya’s southern coast, in October.\nLitigation against Amu Power (a joint venture between Centum and Gulf Energy) and the Kenyan National Environment Management Authority began a decade ago and construction was ordered to stop in 2019.\nThe environment and land court finally upheld a revocation of the plant’s licence because of flaws in the environmental assessment, particularly a lack of proper public participation. Climate change impacts had also not been properly assessed.\nTotalEnergies ordered to stop greenwashing in France\nLater in the month, TotalEnergies was found to have made false claims about its climate goals in a French court for false claims about its climate goals.\nLes Amis de la Terre France, Greenpeace France and Notre Affaire à Tous, with the support of ClientEarth, claimed TotalEnergies’s “reinvention” marketing campaign broke European consumer law by suggesting it could reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 while continuing to produce fossil fuels.\nThe Paris judicial court ruled that some claims on the company’s French website were likely to mislead consumers because there was not enough information about what they meant.\nMeat companies settle greenwashing claims\nIn early November, New York agreed a $1.1m settlement with Brazilian meat company JBS’s US arm to end a lawsuit claiming the company misled customers about its efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe money will be used to support climate-smart agriculture programmes that help New York farmers adopt best practices to reduce emissions, increase resiliency and enhance productivity. JBS USA also agreed to reform its environmental marketing practices and report annually to the New York office of the attorney general for three years.\nSoon after, Tyson Foods also agreed to stop saying it will reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and marketing beef as climate friendly to settle a greenwashing lawsuit brought by agriculture industry watchdog Environmental Working Group.\nUK government publishes tougher climate plan\nThe UK government published a revised carbon budget and growth delivery plan in October after its previous plan was ruled unlawful by the high court.\nThe new document reaffirms the UK’s commitment to decarbonise its electricity supply by 2030 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically by 2037, with specific measures for energy, transport, agriculture, homes and industry.\nIt follows a successful lawsuit by the Good Law Project, Friends of the Earth and ClientEarth. After the striking down of the original net zero strategy in court in 2022, the trio argued that the “threadbare” revised version was still not good enough.\nHowever, campaigners are planning another round of legal action challenging national climate strategy, this time at the European court of human rights.\nThree Norwegian oilfields ruled illegal\nLicences for three oilfields in the North Sea were declared illegal in November by a Norwegian court because they were approved without the full impacts of climate change being considered.\nThe Borgarting court of appeal upheld a claim by Greenpeace Nordic and Natur og Ungdom challenging permission for the Equinor-operated Breidablikk and Aker BP’s Yggdrasil and Tyrving fields.\nThe decision closely followed the European court of human rights’s dismissal of a lawsuit by the same claimants against Norway, which nonetheless set important standards for how states should undertake environmental impact assessments of fossil fuel projects.\nHowever, the Borgarting court stopped short of ordering the fields to stop producing oil, giving the Norwegian government six months to sort out the licences.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/31/greenwashing-illegality-false-claims-climate-litigation-wins-2025", "published_at": "2025-12-31T17:00:15+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Defence stocks enjoyed commitments by Nato’s western European members to spend more heavily on equipment. That assisted companies such as Rolls-Royce, whose remarkable run has taken the shares from sub-100p in 2022 to £11-plus today. Banks have had near-perfect conditions of low defaults and falling interest rates. The bill (for some) from the car finance scandal was brushed off easily.\nGlobal mining companies, which are still a significant slice of the Footsie, enjoyed the gold-inspired rally in everything related to precious metals plus the demand for copper that comes with energy transition and electrification. The best-performing share in the index was Fresnillo, a Mexico-based silver miner, up almost fivefold. Over in pharmaceuticals, Donald Trump’s bark on tariffs and prices proved worse than his bite. AstraZeneca, the most valuable component of a value-weighted index, rose almost 30%.\nMeanwhile, National Grid and SSE, two heavyweights in UK energy infrastructure, benefited from regulatory funding for the upgrade of the transmission network. Virtually the only “problem” stock at the top end of the index was Diageo, the Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff drinks maker, which was mired in the related issues of a weak global spirits market and boardroom upheaval.\nSue Noffke, the head of UK equities at the fund manager Schroders, makes the point that the Footsie’s rise should not be viewed purely as a one-year phenomenon. Go back three years and the average investment return including dividends has been 14% a year for a cumulative return of 48%.\nA cheap starting point is obviously one factor. Even as late as spring 2024, the Footsie was priced at just under 10 times its predicted earnings for the next year, extremely low by historical standards.\nNoffke also highlights corporate self-improvement – “companies doing it for themselves” – and the role of share buybacks. There is a long list of companies that can be seen as getting stricter in their capital allocation in pursuit of better returns, and being prodded by shareholders to do so.\nUnilever demerged its ice-cream division as Magnum in 2025, echoing GSK’s separation of its consumer products division as Haleon in 2022. The industrial heavyweight Smiths Group is breaking itself up. BP, after years of flip-flopping, is “pivoting” away from its low-return renewables investments. Anglo American has engaged in a multiyear restructuring that ended in a well-received $50bn (£37bn) merger with the Canadian rival Teck Resources. AB Foods is contemplating splitting the discount retail chain Primark from its food and ingredients businesses.\nThe buyback angle represents a shift in thinking in London. In the old days, dividends were a priority, which was why a core part of Marshall’s dinosaur thesis was that London’s fund managers are obsessed with income rather than growth. Now buybacks, which offer more bang for the same buck when – critically – the shares are cheap, are a greater part of the mix. In any case, the idea that UK investors set the tone is probably out of date: US funds own more of the Footsie than the locals these days.\nNoffke calculates that 55% of larger UK companies have bought back at least 1% of their shares in the past 12 months, compared with 40% in the US. Shell has bought back more than 20% of its equity since 2020, for example. “The UK stock market has moved on from being the dividend yield capital of the world,” she argues. “It’s still attractive on dividend income, but it’s not so standout. It has now moved to become the share buyback capital of the world.”\nTherein – maybe – lies a path for an image overhaul for the London stock market. The old complaints about the dearth of new arrivals and the lack of whizzy US-style tech and AI stocks are still heard. But investors ultimately care about valuations and returns.\nNoffke puts the appeal of the UK market like this: “We have a different sectoral mix that is not dependent, or wholly dependent, on an AI thematic. We are cheap. We are cash rich. We’re buying a lot of shares back, and are quite shareholder friendly. And we’re seeing a lot of companies that, through a combination of top-down from management and bottom-up from the investor base, are showing more grip and more ambition.”\nThe Footsie still has to keep going in the same fashion. The concentration in its makeup at the top end could work against it if a few important sectors go into reverse; and the relative lack of tech stocks may eventually become a bigger problem. But 2025 continued a good run.

And it’s hard not to feel despondent and powerless.\nI joined the Guardian full time in 2019, as the paper’s first environmental justice correspondent, and have reported from across the US and the region over the past six years. It’s been painful to see so many families – and entire communities – devastated by fires, floods, extreme heat, sea level rise and food shortages. But what’s given me hope during these six years of reporting as both an environmental and climate justice reporter are the people fighting to save our planet from catastrophe – in their communities, on the streets and in courtrooms across the world.\nI have always tried to use a justice and equity lens in my journalism on the causes, impacts and solutions relating to the climate crisis. For me, that has meant telling the stories of people who are often ignored or sidelined despite their lived experience and expertise – especially Indigenous people, protesters, activists and local communities fighting back. I have also tried to examine how the climate crisis intersects with – and often exacerbates – other forms of inequity, such as economic inequality, racism, misogyny, land struggles and unequal access to housing and healthcare. The uncomfortable truth is that we are not all in this together. We didn’t all contribute to the climate crisis equally, we’re not all feeling its impacts equally and we don’t all have equal access to resources that might help us cope with or even solve it.\nIn my final piece for the Guardian, I salute the grassroots organizers, scientists, health workers, Indigenous peoples, students and youth activists, peasant farmers, human rights experts and journalists taking on governments and corporations. The climate justice movement scored major victories in 2025, and it has shown us that ordinary people power can – and is – dismantling the status quo.\nPeople power is reshaping the climate fight\n“While the majority of states and businesses try to continue doing business as usual, we’re starting to see cracks in that inertia as the power of the people has helped to give light to what is not working – and identify the actual actions that we need,” said Astrid Puentes Riaño, the UN special rapporteur on the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.\nDespite the UN climate negotiations in Belém failing to agree, yet again, to phase out fossil fuels, Cop30 did establish the first-ever just transition mechanism (JTM), a plan to ensure that the move to a green-energy economy is fair and inclusive and protects the rights of all people, including workers, frontline communities, women and Indigenous people.\nWhile far from perfect, the JTM was agreed only after years of civil society organising, including impossible-to-ignore protests during Cop30. The mechanism represents an important step in putting people at the centre of climate policy after decades of technocratic fixes, according to Puentes.\nThere were also encouraging signs that a growing number of states – from the global south and north – have had enough of the inertia and obstructionism blocking meaningful action, and are prepared to stand with affected communities and go their own way.\nColombia and the Netherlands, backed by 22 nations, will independently develop a roadmap to fossil fuel phaseout, beginning with a conference in April 2026 in the coal port city of Santa Marta, Colombia. The plan is for states, cities, affected communities and health, science, human rights and other experts to share experiences and best practices, and implement policy ideas outside the snail-paced, consensus-based Cop process.\nThis parallel fossil-fuel roadmap initiative could establish regional solutions and a trading bloc with the power to sanction nations – and financial institutions – that continue to support fossil fuels.\nElisa Morgera, the UN special rapporteur on climate change and human rights, said the new alliance could be the gamechanger. “We now have a sizeable group of states from all regions who want to engage in good faith and make progress on phasing out fossil fuels and cannot wait any longer for the Cop process,” she said.\n“It is so important for people around the world to see that there is political will and political power to advance this, and to see what it looks like, as there is a big gap in imagination. We’ve been so bombarded by climate disinformation from fossil fuel companies that it is hard to imagine what our life would be like without them, but there are examples of cities, towns and communities doing it.”\nBoth Colombia and the Netherlands were pushed hard by ordinary people to do the right thing.\nIn 2023, Colombia, a major fossil fuel producer with fierce, well-organized climate and social justice movements, signed on to the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty that now includes 18 countries, 140 cities and subnational governments, the World Health Organization, more than 4,000 civil society organisations and more than 3,000 scientists and academics.\nIt was this civil society-led initiative that first created a blueprint to halt new fossil fuel projects and manage an equitable phaseout of coal, oil and gas.\n“Many political leaders are captured by fossil fuel interests or lack the courage to challenge them, while developing countries are held back by the rich world’s failure to deliver finance and technology anywhere near a fair share,” said Harjeet Singh, a veteran climate activist and strategic adviser to the non-proliferation treaty. “That’s why movements are indispensable watchdogs – naming the polluters, exposing greenwashing and demanding the funds, timelines and protections workers and communities need to transition with rights and dignity.”\nAnd change can be contagious. After mounting protests and litigation by Indigenous communities and environmental groups over Brazil’s expansion of oil and gas projects in the Amazon, Cop30 president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced the first step toward a national fossil fuel phaseout roadmap. Still, head-spinning contradictory policies are all too common among states lauded as climate leaders – and Brazil also recently passed the so-called “devastation bill”, which critics warn will accelerate deforestation in the Amazon.\nCourts are becoming a frontline for climate justice\nFailure to transition away from fossil fuels is a violation of international law, according to an international court of justice (ICJ) ruling in July 2025, alongside multiple other international courts and tribunals.\nThe ICJ advisory opinion, which was initiated by Pacific Island law students, confirmed what communities had argued in courts around the world for a decade. Governments have a whole host of legal duties arising as a result of the climate crisis, including phasing out fossil fuels and regulating polluting corporations.\nThe landmark ruling by the highest court in the world can be traced back to a 2015 lawsuit when the Netherlands became the first state ordered to take stronger climate action, in a case brought by 900 Dutch citizens and the Urgenda Foundation, an environmental group.\n“In just 10 years, climate litigation has evolved from a handful of complaints before domestic courts to a global accountability system recognised by the highest international courts and tribunals,” said Dennis Van Berkel, legal counsel at the Urgenda Foundation, in a recent report by the Climate Litigation Network. “That transformation was built case by case, country by country. Some judgments failed, but each contributed – refining arguments, strengthening alliances, raising public awareness and laying the groundwork for those that followed.”\nA recent judgment in South Africa halted a major internationally funded offshore gas and oil project opposed by coastal communities and environmental groups. The government has paused all other new oil and gas proposals, pending an appeal.\n“Access to justice and litigation is the most peaceful way to advance and help states and businesses to correct mistakes, make the right decision and advance climate action. It’s not that litigation solves everything, but it’s a very important piece in order to advance the systemic changes that we need,” Puentes of the UN said.\nIndigenous knowledge points the way forward\nFor thousands of years, Indigenous peoples have lived in respectful harmony with the planet – using, not exploiting, natural resources from our forests, seas, rivers and land. In addition to this vast ancient knowledge, we have 21st-century tools and technologies, and innovative grassroots and regional solutions that together should be the heart of global efforts to tackle the climate crisis.\nNext year, like every year, it will fall on ordinary people to harness their immense power through the courts, protests, multilateral spaces and the ballot box to ensure climate-impacted communities and human rights become the centre of negotiations and climate action.\n“If we wait for Cop31 to save us, we have already surrendered,” said Raj Patel, a research professor at the University of Texas and author of Stuffed and Starved: The Hidden Battle for the World Food System.\n“The test is not whether diplomats can craft better language in Antalya [in Turkey] next year, but whether farmers’ movements, Indigenous movements and climate movements can generate enough political pressure to make governments fear inaction more than they fear confronting corporate power.”\n-\nNina Lakhani is a climate justice reporter for the Guardian US", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/31/environmental-justice-ordinary-people-power", "published_at": "2025-12-31T14:00:16+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The artisan master standing by his side calmly nodded and said something that I still think about. He told him: “You put too much pressure on it, you kept it unbalanced and you forgot that it, too, has a heart.”\nThe year we are leaving behind has been plagued from the start by a series of social, economic, environmental, technological and institutional challenges, all happening with such speed and intensity that we are yet to fully comprehend their impact on our lives, let alone on future generations. As the overwhelming strain of domestic and geopolitical changes continues to build up, I cannot help but remember the man’s words. Too much pressure. Unstable, uncertain and replete with deep inequalities. This could well be the year we forgot that the Earth, too, has a heart. It definitely feels like the year when the world was broken.\nIn 2024, to be fair, many of the current problems were already present and growing. But there was also a strong wave of positive expectations and public excitement as more than 1.6 billion people went to the polls. It was a time of unparalleled concentrated democratic activity full of promises, incautious confidence, passionate speeches and fiery oratory. Many voters were keen to express their anger and discontent, and express it they did. The mammoth year of elections revealed the importance of not only the ballot box, but also of the surrounding democratic institutions and norms. Language matters. How we talk to each other matters. Democratic decline always starts with words. When political opponents are treated as “enemies”, or even worse “enemies of the people”, the whole system suffers.\nCompared with that, the past 12 months have been marked by an emotional and intellectual fatigue for many people across different borders. What we are used to calling “the liberal international order” no longer carries weight. Deeply fractured and unable to hide its cracks, it is coming apart. The housing crisis, the lack of affordable rents and equal opportunities, and social and economic injustices have all eroded trust. Meanwhile, climate breakdown, AI threats and risks to pluralism, the possibility of another pandemic, and increasing militarism and jingoism alongside shifting alliances have contributed to the sense that the system that emerged from the ruins of the second world war has come to an end. As we close the first quarter of the century under the shadow of a new nuclear age, uncertainty is everywhere.\nIn 2025, divisions have sadly deepened. At a time when humanity is faced with immense global challenges, we have been pushed further into boxes of “us v them”.\nAn existential anxiety affects and drains many of us – east, west, north and south. Young and old. Perhaps some people are better at hiding their emotions than others, but when we look underneath polished social media facades of happy and fulfilled lives, we can see that anxiety is actually widespread. Fear. Frustration. Enervation. A new word has been coined to define the zeitgeist: “polycrisis”. The worst thing we can do, individually and collectively, is to allow ourselves to descend into numbness. To become desensitised to the pain and suffering of others: in Gaza, in Sudan, in Ukraine. This is why good and honest journalism matters all the more today. Many pieces published in the Guardian this year not only showed a remarkable depth and breadth, but also helped us to remain engaged and connected. In that sense, they are an antidote to numbness.\nThere were sentimental moments this year, too. In the UK, we cried again over the Sycamore Gap tree and the senseless, meaningless hatred displayed by two men, convicted this year, who decided it would be fun to cut down something that had brought joy to so many for so long. It is interesting that the human sentimentality that we were allowed to display in response to the death of a beloved tree was denied to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, when she was caught on camera crying in the Commons. The media and social media coverage was rather sexist. Amelia Gentleman wrote a coruscating piece asking why women’s workplace tears are regarded as a source of shame. Delving into another emotionally difficult subject, Polly Toynbee wrote courageously on the assisted dying debate, underlining how a decent life can end in a decent death.\nOne of the most poignant and important pieces published this year was co-written by Malak A Tantesh and Emma Graham-Harrison about the despair of parents and grandparents in Gaza watching their children and grandchildren with skeletal bodies, so malnourished that they have become vulnerable to all kinds of horrible diseases: “We have faced hunger before, but never like this.” Dan Sabbagh composed an article about Ukraine that highlighted the devastating consequences of the occupation and war for ordinary families, with one person stating: “We never thought the war would come to our village.” Amplifying human stories can help to dismantle the cold and elitist rhetoric that treats people as sheer numbers.\nA recent report revealed that Kabul could soon become the first modern city to completely run out of water, with all the aquifers drying up as early as 2030. More than 6 million people live in Afghanistan’s capital. In the UK, there is a growing public resentment and anger against water companies that keep pumping sewage into our rivers. Meanwhile, rivers are dying elsewhere, with the Middle East and north Africa being home to seven out of the 10 most water-stressed nations. The climate crisis is the story of water and the ones who disproportionately bear the brunt are always women, children and tpoor people.\nThere were some moments of light. Even small miracles, such as the reunion of Oasis. We have seen a heartwarming rise in book clubs and reading parties. Unexpectedly, in this time of hyperinformation and fast consumption, many young people are taking up traditional hobbies. It feels as if the faster our world spins, the more urgent and universal our need to slow down, to connect, to think, to care.\nIn Argentina recently, an 18th-century painting called Portrait of a Lady that was stolen from a Jewish art collector by the Nazis was recovered after being spotted on an estate agent’s listing. She looks at us calmly, the woman in the portrait, in her flower-embroidered dress; she who has seen too many atrocities but is still resilient and full of life. As always, art, culture and literature offer us a sanctuary, a home, a sense of togetherness. Glassblowers remind us that even the worst shattered glass can be melted, resculpted and revived. It all begins with an honest recognition of what remains broken and a willingness to mend.\n-\nElif Shafak is a novelist and political scientist\n-\nThis is an edited version of Elif Shafak’s introduction to The Bedside Guardian 2025\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It includes Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube.\nLe Monde and France Info reported on Wednesday that a draft bill was now complete and contained two measures: a ban on social media for under-15s and a ban on mobile phones in high schools, where 15- to 18-year-olds study. Phones have already been banned in primary and middle schools.\nThe bill will be submitted to France’s Conseil d’État for legal review in the coming days. Education unions will also look at the proposed high-school ban on phones.\nThe government wants the social media ban to come into force from September 2026.\nLe Monde reported the text of the draft bill cited “the risks of excessive screen use by teenagers”, including the dangers of being exposed to inappropriate social media content, online bullying, and altered sleep patterns. The bill states the need to “protect future generations” from dangers that threaten their ability to thrive and live together in a society with shared values.\nEarlier this month, Macron confirmed at a public debate in Saint Malo that he wanted a social media ban for young teenagers. He said there was “consensus being shaped” on the issue after Australia introduced its ban. “The more screen time there is, the more school achievement drops … the more screen time there is, the more mental health problems go up,” he said.\nHe used the analogy of a teenager getting into a Formula One racing car before they had learned to drive. “If a child is in a Formula One car and they turn on the engine, I don’t want them to win the race, I just want them to get out of the car. I want them to learn the highway code first, and to ensure the car works, and to teach them to drive in a different car.”\nSeveral other countries are considering social media bans for under-15s after Australia’s ban including Denmark, whose government hopes to introduce a ban in 2026, and Norway. Malaysia is also planning a social media ban for under-16s from 2026. In the UK, the Labour government has not ruled out a ban, saying “nothing is off the table” but any ban must be “based on robust evidence”.\nAnne Le Hénanff, the French minister in charge of digital development and artificial intelligence, told Le Parisien this month that the social media ban for under-15s was a government priority, and that the bill would be “short and compatible with European law”, namely the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) – regulation intended to combat hateful speech, misinformation and disinformation.\nThe social media ban is part of Macron’s attempt to shape his legacy as he enters his difficult final year as president with a divided parliament.\nOn 23 December, last-minute legislation was passed to keep the government in business into January after parliament failed to agree a full budget for 2026. Attempts to agree a budget will resume next month.\nA French parliamentary inquiry into TikTok’s psychological effects concluded in September that the platform was like a “slow poison” to children. The co-head of the inquiry, the centrist lawmaker Laure Miller, told France Info that TikTok was an “ocean of harmful content” that was very visible to children through algorithms that kept them in a bubble. TikTok responded that it was being unfairly scapegoated for “industry-wide and societal challenges”.\nThe French parliament report recommended more broadly that children under 15 in France should be banned entirely from using social media, and those between 15 and 18 should face a night-time “digital curfew”, meaning social media would be made unavailable to them between 10pm and 8am.\nThe inquiry was set up after a 2024 French lawsuit against TikTok by seven families who accused it of exposing their children to content that was pushing them towards ending their lives.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/31/france-plans-social-media-ban-for-under-15s-from-september-2026", "published_at": "2025-12-31T15:31:39+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The tech titan began the year holding court with Donald Trump in Washington DC. As the months ticked by, one public appearance after another baffled the US and the world. Musk appeared to give a Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration, staunchly championed a 19-year-old staffer nicknamed “Big Balls,” denied reports of being a drug addict while advising the president, and showed up at a White House press conference with a black eye – all in the first half of the year alone.\n“Elon’s attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you’re an incrementalist, you just won’t get your rocket to the moon,” Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, told Vanity Fair in an expansive interview earlier this month. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china.”\nMusk saw huge, multibillion-dollar wins and equally large losses in business this year. In his dealings with federal agencies, he was able to secure new enormous government contracts and expand SpaceX’s operations. With Tesla, he was approved for a pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire even as the company’s global sales plunged. At the same time, Musk and his businesses were the target of protests, lawsuits and an exodus of high-level executives. He ended the year with a fortune worth some $600bn.\nIn the background, his turbulent personal life continued to provide surprises. Rightwing influencer Ashley St Clair sued Musk in February for custody of their five-month-old baby, revealing that Musk had fathered a 13th publicly documented child, for a total of now 14 children. As Musk made regular attacks in posts on X against transgender people, his estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who is trans, was featured in New York magazine and modeled at New York fashion week. And the New York Times published a lengthy investigation into Musk’s father, Errol Musk, who was accused of child sex abuse.\nThe relationship that dominated Musk’s public life, however, was his friendship and falling out with Trump. On the day of his inauguration, Trump empowered Musk to gut government agencies, which the tech billionaire did with zeal and abandon. But by June, Musk and Trump had broken up. Their bromance burned hot and fast. On one of his final days as a special government employee, Musk lashed out at the president on his social media platform, X, saying: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.” The post has since been deleted.\nThough the drama surrounding Musk was frequently absurd and unpredictable, it was also consequential. This was a year when the richest person in the world obtained new levels of wealth and power that few in history have ever approached, one that demonstrated the depth of his global influence as he sought to advance his rightwing agenda and grow his tech empire.\nWhile Musk had stayed away from Washington DC after the Epstein post, the billionaire was invited back in November for a White House dinner in honor of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. By the end of the year, Trump and Musk seemed to have made amends. When asked by Fox Business this month if Musk was back in his circle of friends, Trump suggested the two could have a future together again.\n“Well, I really don’t know,” Trump said. “I mean, I like Elon a lot.”\nMusk expressed more regret than the president over the course the year had taken. When his former aide Katie Miller asked whether he would lead the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) again, knowing what he knows now, he responded: “Instead of doing Doge, I would have worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\nMusk goes to Washington\nAfter becoming a Republican mega-donor and campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Musk began the year on a high as he prepared to enter the administration as the de facto leader of Doge. He immediately set a tone of chaos and outrage that would persist for the length of his time in the White House.\nDuring Trump’s internationally televised inauguration event in January, Musk issued what many people interpreted as back-to-back fascist-syle salutes as he concluded a speech. Rights groups condemned the gesture while Musk attempted to dismiss the criticism as “dirty tricks” from legacy media. The reaction was so intense and negative that some Tesla owners sold their cars in response to Musk’s gestures.\nMusk spurred further condemnation from Jewish groups after appearing virtually at a rally for Germany’s far-right AfD party. The Tesla CEO told the crowd via livestream that Germans should not focus on “past guilt” and “move beyond that” in an apparent reference to Nazi Germany.\nAs Musk started his work with Doge, the controversies and backlash against his politics grew. The newly formed bureau operated first as a loose collection of appointed staffers and then subsumed the US Digital Service. It rapidly moved to gut federal agencies and conduct mass layoffs across the government even as ethics watchdogs launched lawsuits accusing Musk’s group of violating privacy and transparency laws, some of which continue today. Musk personally bragged about feeding the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, “into the woodchipper”. The cuts would cause the abrupt cancellation of aid programs worldwide, disrupt HIV/Aids treatment for millions and result in children starving to death in a hunger crisis that experts agree was needless.\nAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk appeared to relish his new role as the Trump administration’s demolition man. He brandished a chainsaw on stage and told the audience “I am become meme!” as he waved it about in sunglasses and a gold chain. In March, he once again began to pour more money into Republican causes by holding rallies and handing out $1m checks to support a conservative judge in Wisconsin’s supreme court race.\nThe pushback against Musk’s political blitz soon began to frustrate his ambitions, however. Judges that ruled Doge’s activities illegal or issued temporary injunctions infuriated Musk, who called for the widespread impeachment of any “activist judges” who opposed his agenda. His preferred candidate in the Wisconsin supreme court race lost by a significant margin, a sign to some in Washington that Musk’s presence had potentially become politically toxic.\nMusk left his role in the White House in May amid disputes around his pick for who would head Nasa and clashes over Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Upon his exit, he signalled that his time with politics had come to a close, claiming he would reduce his campaign finance contributions in the future and return to his businesses. Yet he quickly put himself back in the spotlight with his public battle with Trump on social media and vowed he would start a third political party called the “America party,” a promise that has yet to come to meaningful fruition.\nMusk’s political leanings continued to drift rightward, allying himself via near-constant posts on X interacting with far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson and telling Joe Rogan that “it should be OK to have white pride”. He led an online grievance campaign in early October against the Anti-Defamation League, the country’s most prominent Jewish advocacy group, claiming that it “hates Christians” and suggesting that their documenting of extremism encouraged murder. Although no longer in the administration, his extreme conservative takes on immigration, race and politics have persisted as prominent features of his public identity.\nMusk’s constellation of businesses\nThe year in Musk’s businesses offered the billionaire even larger truckloads of money than before, despite facing intense controversy and competition.\nUnlike other tech moguls, who typically helm one company at a time, Musk sits astride several corporations. He controls the rocket company SpaceX and the tunneling and brain implant companies, Boring Inc and Neuralink, respectively. Musk also runs the social media company X, which he bought for a second time this year via his artificial intelligence company xAI. Then there’s Tesla, his electric car company.\nOf all his enterprises, Tesla especially courted attention this year, as people enraged by Musk’s work with Doge focused their attention on the carmaker’s showrooms. Across the country, protesters marched at ongoing “Tesla Takedown” events. One sign at a San Francisco protest in March read: “Burn your swastikar before it burns you.” Dozens of Tesla cars and charging stations nationwide were set on fire as one-off vandals protested the billionaire.\nThough Trump and Musk hosted what amounted to a Tesla sales event on the lawn of the White House in March, Tesla saw its sales slump worldwide.\nBy June, Musk had announced the rollout of its self-driving robotaxis in Austin. Within the first week, bystanders had recorded videos of the cars having difficulty turning left or picking which side of the road to drive on, which attracted the attention of regulators. These robotaxis, which were required to operate with a human safety driver up until earlier this month, have encountered only a handful of documented safety incidents since then.\nLawsuits against Tesla also piled up throughout the year. In August, a Florida jury awarded more than $200m to victims of a deadly crash involving its Autopilot technology in August. And in California, two separate lawsuits were filed in October over three teenagers who were killed when a Cybertruck caught on fire and locked them inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also opened several investigations into the carmaker over safety issues.\nWhile Tesla’s plunge in profits continued throughout the year, that didn’t stop the company’s shareholders from approving a pay package for Musk – the largest corporate payout in history – that could catapult him to the status of the world’s first trillionaire.\nTesla’s year finished with a blow from California’s department of motor vehicles. The agency said the car company had misled consumers and exaggerated the capabilities of its Autopilot technology. If Tesla doesn’t “remedy the situation” within 90 days, the DMV said earlier in December, the company will be banned from selling cars in the state, its biggest US market.\nWith SpaceX, Musk was able to curry favor with the federal government. Not only did his Starlink satellites continue to dominate the Earth’s atmosphere – the SpaceX subsidiary operates the vast majority of all satellites in orbit – but the Federal Aviation Administration and the air force gave SpaceX the go-ahead to increase rocket launches in Florida, Texas and California. This came despite the company’s massive Starship, a 400ft machine that Musk hopes to one day fly to Mars, repeatedly blowing up and showering shrapnel across the Caribbean. One such explosion prompted legal action from Mexico, which said the debris harmed thousands of endangered sea turtle hatchlings.\nMusk also consolidated his social media and artificial intelligence companies this year. In March, he announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock transaction that he said valued X at $33bn. Both companies are privately held.\nxAI makes the Grok chatbot, which is integrated into X. The chatbot had countless meltdowns in the second year since its release. It pushed conspiracy theories about “white genocide”, claimed Trump won the 2020 election and spewed numerous antisemitic claims, once referring to itself as “MechaHitler”. Nevertheless, Musk was able to seal a $200m contract from the Department of Defense to integrate Grok into federal government tools.\nMeanwhile, Musk’s xAI datacenters in Memphis, Tennessee, were accused of polluting historically Black neighborhoods. The company had moved in dozens of portable methane gas generators to power the facilities, initially without permits, which brought several protests and a pending lawsuit from the NAACP.\nNeuralink, which operates in relative secrecy compared with Musk’s other businesses, accelerated the tests of its brain chips in 2025. The company says its product allows a person limited control of a computer via their thoughts. After announcing its first successful implantation in 2024, the company announced in September that it had completed the procedure in 12 patients.\nThroughout the year, top executives fled the uproar involved in managing Musk’s companies. Linda Yaccarino departed as X’s CEO, as did its advertising chief. xAI lost its co-founder, chief financial officer and lead lawyer. Likewise, Tesla saw several executive exits, including the vice-president of North American sales, the director of the battery team, the head of the “Optimus” robot project and several leaders of the company’s various car divisions.\nA year of personal feuds\nMusk, whose life is frequently animated by grievances and breakups, had a banner year for high-profile fights, even by his own standards. Longstanding feuds reignited while his close relationship with Trump imploded in full public view, all as he posted a steady stream of attacks against immigrants, the trans community, the media, Wikipedia and a host of other targets on X, where he boasts 230 million followers.\nMusk began the year by accusing the government of South Africa, his birth country, of anti-white racism when he sought approval for his Starlink internet provider to operate in the country. It was part of a series of spats Musk would have with governments abroad and world leaders, including declaring that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was “complicit in the rape of Britain” in one of his anti-immigration tirades.\nAs Musk picked fights internationally, he also became a combative presence during his time within the Trump administration. Tensions with other administration officials resulted in reports of tense meetings in the Oval Office and a loud, near-physical yelling match between him and treasury secretary Scott Bessent in the halls of the White House. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy became another adversary in a clash over the future of Nasa, with Musk calling him “Sean Dummy” on X amid a string of other insults.\nEven Musk and Trump’s formerly close friendship soured, as the president pushed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act that removed tax credits for electric vehicles and threatened to harm Tesla’s already flagging sales. Musk lashed out at Trump on Twitter in June, saying that the bill’s addition to the deficit would destroy the work Doge had done. The deterioration in their relationship culminated in Musk accusing the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, in turn, insinuated he could cancel Musk’s government contracts and said his most prominent financial backer had “lost his mind”.\nThe messy, public breakup between Musk and Trump marked the end of the Tesla CEO’s time as self-described “first buddy” to the president. Although the two have entered a period of rapprochement in recent months, Musk is far from the constant presence at Trump’s side that he was on the campaign trail.\nMusk’s pivot back to his tech empire allowed him to refocus on other grudges, including against Sam Altman, his former OpenAI business partner turned rival. Musk added to his series of lawsuits against Altman’s AI company with a case in August that alleged Apple and OpenAI were engaging in anticompetitive conduct, an accusation that OpenAI described as part of Musk’s “pattern of harassment” against the firm. The two traded barbs on X, which included fighting over whose posts were getting more views.\nOne of Musk’s final feuds of the year came from a more unusual source – famed 87-year-old author Joyce Carol Oates, whose cutting observation about him on X received more than 5.6m views.\n“So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates – scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history,” Oates posted in November.\nA day later, after Musk made a show of enthusiastically replying to several clips of movies on X, he responded to Oates’s critique.\n“Oates is a liar and delights in being mean,” Musk posted. “Not a good human.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/31/elon-musk-doge-tesla-ai-trump", "published_at": "2025-12-31T13:00:11+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Fitrell did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn a statement, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said Trump “has treated Africa not as a charity case, but as a powerhouse partner. Under his leadership, American capital, technology, and diplomacy are helping African nations secure peace, build real energy independence, and turn their natural wealth into jobs and opportunity for their people.”\nIt’s a consequential pivot, but African experts say it’s too soon to tell what it will amount to, or whether it can survive the personal touch Trump brings to diplomacy with the continent, in which he has also feuded with longstanding US partners and insulted Africans themselves.\n“The organizing principle is, if it’s in the long-term or short-term interest of the United States, as I see it, then I’m going to do it,” said Ebenezer Obadare, a senior fellow for Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nThe first big decision Trump made towards the continent was the dismantling of USAID, which had been heavily involved in development and emergency assistance in sub-Saharan Africa. With it gone, a study published in the Lancet forecasts an additional 14m deaths globally by 2030, with many of those likely to occur in Africa.\nHe has also singled out African governments and nationalities for restrictions and criticism. Trump is feuding with the government of South Africa, has publicly railed against Somalis, cracked down on visas for citizens from more than two dozen African countries and halted refugee admissions – with the exception of a small group of white South Africans.\nThe global tariff barrage he unleashed has hit businesses in African nations who have depended on US markets, such Lesotho’s textile manufacturers, and the Republican-controlled Congress hardly made a peep when the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a longstanding measure to facilitate trade between the United States and the continent, lapsed in September.\nWhile Barack Obama made four trips to the continent during his presidency and Joe Biden would go on to make one, Trump never visited sub-Saharan Africa during his first term. His best known foray into African affairs came when he sparked official fury by dubbing its 54 nations “shithole countries” in a widely reported private remark, which Trump recently confirmed he had indeed uttered.\nMurithi Mutiga, the program director for Africa at the International Crisis Group, a non-profit focused on addressing global conflicts, said all signs indicate that disinterest will continue in his second term. “Africa clearly runs dead bottom in his list of priorities, not just for Trump, but for the administration in general,” he said.\nMutiga pointed to the national security strategy the Trump administration released last month, in which Africa was given three paragraphs at the very end of the 29-page document. “The United States should instead look to partner with select countries to ameliorate conflict, foster mutually beneficial trade relationships, and transition from a foreign aid paradigm to an investment and growth paradigm capable of harnessing Africa’s abundant natural resources and latent economic potential,” it reads.\nTrump’s visa restrictions against African nations and coarse language towards its people “will accelerate trends that were already there in terms of young people increasingly looking to the east for opportunities, particularly for higher education”, Mutiga warns.\nTrump’s dispute with South Africa appears to have been influenced by his erstwhile ally Elon Musk, who was born there and has alleged that the white Afrikaner minority is being persecuted. That led to the United States boycotting the G20 leaders summit last month in Johannesburg, and Trump vowing to stop South African delegates from attending next year’s meeting in Florida.\nRedi Tlhabi, a veteran South African journalist living in Washington DC, said that Pretoria’s case before the international court of justice alleging genocide by US ally Israel was a major factor driving the animosity. But the narrative of a “white genocide” happening in South Africa also “aligns beautifully now in Trump’s second term with US political culture and the idea that diversity is not welcome, it’s a threat”, she added.\nA similar fight seemed to be brewing with Nigeria in November, when Trump threatened to cut off aid and send the military in “guns-a-blazing” after saying its government “continues to allow the killing of Christians”. That collided with the complicated reality in Africa’s most-populous nation, which is about evenly divided between Christians and Muslims and riven with security crises that have killed and displaced people of both religions.\nClement Nwankwo, executive director of the Policy and Legal Advocacy Centre thinktank in Nigeria’s capital Abuja, said Trump’s words had the potential to spur change among Nigerian leaders who have long been viewed as unable to stop, or even complicit in, the violence.\n“The Nigerian government appears to be saying the right things in recent weeks, since President Trump made his threat,” Nwankwo said. “And for a lot of Nigerians, seeing the Nigerian government becoming responsive to this threat is what was needed in the first place.”\nAfter the Christmas airstrike, Nigerian government officials said they had approved the US intervention, and may collaborate on further attacks.\nTrump has made no secret of his desire to win a Nobel peace prize, and joined forces with Qatar to mediate the conflict in the eastern DRC, while sending an envoy to negotiate a resolution to Sudan’s disastrous civil war, so far without success. While the Congo deal appears to have been broken right away, Mutiga said it “helps to at least introduce a degree of diplomacy and a channel outside the battlefield”.\n“I think we need to give some credit to the US, even if they’re probably impelled by extractive interests, at least it’s better than nothing,” he added.\nObadare characterized the new US approach as similar to those of its rivals Russia and China, who have deepened their involvement in the continent in recent decades. “It’s a long overdue recognition of African agency, and to that extent, it represents, at least at the level of symbols, taking Africa very seriously,” he said.\nTlhabi predicted that in practice, the new approach will mean, “an African country that doesn’t have anything to put on the table … is not on his radar.”\n“The engagement that we are talking about in the second Trump administration, I don’t think it’s aimed at spreading the milk of human kindness, as it were, it is about a transactional posture towards Africa,” she added.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/31/trump-africa-foreign-policy", "published_at": "2025-12-31T13:00:10+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Inflation has come down from its latest peak, mortgage rates have started falling and changes announced in the budget should take some money off energy bills from April.\nBut the price of housing, groceries and energy remain far higher than pre-pandemic, and there are some changes coming that will make aspects of life more expensive.\nHere are some dates that could affect your finances in the coming months.\nJanuary\nDuring this month, mortgage customers on variable-rate deals should start benefiting from December’s Bank of England rate cut.\n1st The energy price cap goes up. The per unit price limit – set by the regulator, Ofgem, and recalculated every three months – will increase by 0.2%, equivalent to taking the typical annual dual-fuel energy bill up by £3 to £1,758.\nThis is the cap for direct debit customers. The prepayment cap is lower, while those who pay in arrears have a higher one. Your actual bill will depend on how much gas and electricity you use and the tariff you are on – some are now cheaper than the price cap.\nInvesting in cryptoassets including bitcoin, stablecoins or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will involve more paperwork from this date.\nHM Revenue and Customs wants to make sure you are paying all relevant taxes, so you will need to provide details, including your national insurance number, to any provider you use to buy, sell or transfer crypto. You should already have been declaring any taxable gains you have made.\n21st The official inflation figures for December come out, having fallen the previous month to 3.2%. The government has promised to tackle the rising cost of living, and so all eyes will be on the Office for National Statistics each month as it reports on prices.\n31st The last day for filling in a self-assessment return for the 2024-25 tax year. Last January, more than 1 million people missed the deadline for filing. HMRC says 31,442 taxpayers left it to almost the last minute, submitting theirs between 11pm and 11.59pm on the day.\nThis date is also the deadline for energy companies to ensure they have a tariff available with low standing charges to help customers who do not use a lot of energy.\nOfgem had initially proposed tariffs with no daily standing charge, but this was watered down. It has warned consumers that these tariffs may have higher unit charges than others, so savings could be offset.\nFebruary\n1st Alcohol duty will go up by 3.66%, in line with the RPI measure of inflation. According to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, the change will add 10p to a bottle of white wine at 11% ABV, 39p to a bottle of 40% ABV whisky and 6p to a four-pack of 4.6% lager.\n5th The Bank of England’s first interest rate decision of the year. The base rate ended 2025 at 3.75% after a cut at the last meeting. The Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, said future decisions would be a “closer call”, so do not bet on another cut.\nMarch\n1st Regulated rail fares will not go up in England. In recent years, this has been the date for inflation-linked increases to come into effect, but in November the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced prices would be frozen.\nThe government said otherwise a full-time commuter to London from Canterbury could have seen their annual season ticket rise by more than £400, to £8,929. About half of fares are unregulated and can go up at any time. Fares in London will go up by 5.8%.\n19th The second interest rate decision of the year. Some forecasters are anticipating two cuts in 2026, with the first in March.\nThis is also when the limit on contactless card spending is scrapped. From now on, card providers can set their own but should allow customers to choose a lower one if they want.\n31st The government’s household support fund is due to end. The fund was available to councils in England to help vulnerable people with the cost of essentials. It was put in place in October 2021 as the cost of living crisis began to bite and has been extended several times.\nApril\n1st About 2.7 million workers will get pay increases. The national living wage, paid to those aged 21 and over, is going up by 4.1% to £12.71 an hour, which will add £900 a year to a full-time worker’s earnings.\nThe national minimum wage for 18- to 20-year-olds is increasing by 8.5% to £10.85, while younger people and those on apprenticeships get a 6% pay rise to £8 an hour.\nNHS prescription charges will not increase. Paid in England, they will remain at £9.90 for each item. They are entirely free in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nSeveral household bills will go up. The annual cost of a TV licence is pegged to September’s CPI inflation rate, which in 2025 was 3.8%. This will take it to just over £181 for a colour TV.\nWater bills are set to rise too. Details have not been announced, but one provider has indicated it could increase bills by 11%. And council tax bills are likely to go up. Councils can raise them by up to 4.99% without a referendum.\nEnergy bills should fall. The leading forecaster Cornwall Insight has forecast that changes in the budget should help cut the price cap by the equivalent of £138 a year for the typical dual-fuel bill. However, how much April’s cap moves will depend on other factors, including wholesale prices.\nVehicle excise duty rates will go up in line with RPI.\n6th The beginning of the 2026-27 tax year. Income tax thresholds have been frozen again, so some people getting pay rises will be pushed into a higher tax bracket.\nIt is the last year in which under-65s will be able to put £20,000 into cash Isas. Banks may offer good rates to encourage people to take advantage of the full allowance.\nSome of the changes to inheritance tax announced in 2024’s autumn budget come into effect, cutting the reliefs available on agricultural land and business property and on shares listed on Aim.\nThe tax on dividends goes up from 8.75% to 10.75% for basic rate taxpayers and 33.75% to 35.75% for higher rate taxpayers. You can earn up to £500 tax-free before those rates kick in.\nThe two-child benefit cap ends. The change will allow families to claim universal credit and child tax credits for more than two children.\nIncreases in the state pension and a range of other benefits come into effect. Someone on a full new state pension will receive £241.30 a week.\nNew rules on how shops display prices come into effect. The changes, which were delayed from the autumn, are designed to make it easier for shoppers to compare prices by making unit prices clearer and forcing retailers to give more information about loyalty pricing.\n30th The Bank of England announces its third interest rate decision of the year.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2026/jan/01/from-energy-prices-to-interest-rates-the-dates-that-could-affect-your-finances-in-2026", "published_at": "2026-01-01T06:00:32+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Whether you hop on one to warm up before an intense strength-training session or use it to gently burn calories while listening to your favourite podcast, the elliptical or cross trainer can strengthen muscle, reduce fat and improve cardiovascular fitness.\nHowever, there is a catch in that these machines vary wildly in their design – and therefore the emphasis they place on different muscles. Traditional elliptical machines eschew moving handles, instead opting for static poles, while cross trainers usually have dynamic handles that recruit the muscles in your back, shoulders and arms. On top of this, stride length, the shape of the handles and the positioning of the footplates can make a big difference to the type of workout you’ll have.\nThey can vary considerably in their weight and size, but are usually bulkier and more cumbersome than, say, a compact treadmill. Home gym aficionados beware: you’ll likely need a fair amount of room for one of these. If you have enough space, though, an elliptical or cross trainer can be a valuable addition to your home training setup.\nAt a glance\n-\nBest cross trainer overall:\nBowFlex Max Trainer M6\n-\nBest value elliptical trainer:\nHorizon EX-59\n-\nBest premium elliptical trainer:\nTechnogym elliptical\n-\nBest compact cross trainer:\nJTX Strider-X8\n-\nBest full-body trainer:\nSchwinn 590 Elliptical\nWhy you should trust me\nI’m a keen fitness fan who does gym-based strength training and kickboxing classes, as well as outdoor trail runs, cold-water surfing, and more. As a result, I’ve often been tasked with testing fitness technology for magazines, newspapers and websites. I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whatever I’m testing, whether that means surfing in the latest smartwatch or feeling the burn to test a set of connected kettlebells.\nI’m also a strong believer that you have to use new tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the correct environment. With exercise ellipticals and cross trainers, that meant getting hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me.\nHow I tested\nAs with any modern piece of fitness equipment, the only way to ascertain whether it’s any good is to don your gym kit and get stuck in. So, after researching the newest and most popular models on the market, I set about trialling all eight of them.\nMost of my testing was carried out in purpose-built boutiques or customer experience centres because accommodating so many examples of such gym equipment in my home is not easy. I did manage to squeeze a couple into my garage via short-term loans, though.\nDuring workouts, I used a smartphone-based decibel reader to get a sense of how loud they were in use, and I also tested any connected or online features, which often meant downloading relevant apps and trialling their workout content.\nWhere trainers had displays, I used these to log in to apps, such as Spotify and YouTube, and I also used any built-in Bluetooth speakers (if this function was offered). For each model, I made notes on ease of use, build quality and any features, as well as the overall size of the machine. If it had transport wheels, I used these to move the trainer around, simulating how easy it would be to manoeuvre in a domestic environment.\nThe best cross trainers and elliptical machines to buy in 2025\nBest value elliptical trainer:\nHorizon EX-59\nAlthough it’s not the cheapest elliptical trainer on this list, the Horizon EX-59 is still my top value pick thanks to its array of features, robust build quality and a relatively low price.\nWhy we love it\nA smooth, front-mounted flywheel provides 10 levels of quiet resistance, and oversize pedals accommodate a variety of different-sized users. With a stride length of 46cm, it’s not dissimilar to the larger elliptical machines you might find at a gym – meaning it feels more natural and less intense than a stepper or cross trainer.\nThe EX-59 connects to third-party apps via Bluetooth, but it won’t automatically adjust the resistance like some rivals do. As with most Horizon fitness equipment, this model works with the brand’s @Zone app, which provides several high-quality on-demand workouts and training plans for free. There’s not a huge amount of content geared towards elliptical training, but most treadmill and exercise bike high-intensity interval training sessions work just as well.\nTo me, it’s not the prettiest fitness machine, though it certainly does the job, offering drinks holders, a place to stash your smartphone or tablet, and a built-in heart-rate monitor on the static handles.\nThe build quality is great, especially considering the price, although that doesn’t extend to the LCD display and console, which are basic. During testing, I found the changes to resistance inputs slow to react: not great if you’re indulging in a Hiit session and you need to spike the heart rate quickly. Similarly, the built-in Bluetooth speakers aren’t really worth the hassle of tethering a device – you’d get better sound quality out of a tin can. Instead, bring a pair of headphones, fire up the @Zone workout app and make the most of those free on-demand classes.\nIt’s a shame that … the Bluetooth speakers are tinny, and ECB magnetic brake resistance is slow to react to inputs.\nDimensions: 61 x 186 x 167cm (WLH)\nWeight: 74.5kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (10 levels)\nStride length: 46cm\nConnectivity: Bluetooth speakers, device rack, USB rapid-charge port; compatible with popular fitness apps via Bluetooth FTMS\nFolding? No\nNoise level: about 42dB\nMaximum user weight: 136kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no touchscreen; has Bluetooth-enabled speakers and a tablet holder for external content\nGreat build quality; good value\nResistance slow to adjust; display and speakers poor\nBest foldable elliptical trainer:\nTechnogym Elliptical\nIf money’s no object, it’s worth a visit to Technogym’s London Mayfair store, which is packed with drool-inducing fitness equipment that will make any home workout space feel like a five-star hotel.\nThis elliptical trainer is part of the brand’s focus on the home and, as such, it folds upright to minimise its footprint in your living room, home gym or – in my case at least – cobweb-strewn garage.\nAs a result, it shuns the traditional front- or rear-mounted flywheel for a suspended set of footplates and a resistance system that’s in its upright body. This helps save space but still offers a comparable, almost anti-gravity upper- and lower-body workout to other premium elliptical machines.\nWith 25 difficulty levels and up to 600W of electrically adjustable resistance (up to 160 strides a minute: good luck with that), the elliptical packs a mean punch – and it works perfectly with the brand’s digital workout portfolio. Having said that, although there’s a basic screen to show all the usual important data, you’ll need to bring your own device if you want any sort of guided workout.\nWhy we love it\nTechnogym’s “sessions” are up there with some of Peloton’s interactive classes, although you’ll need to provide your own tablet, smartphone or laptop. Unlike other fitness apps, there are plenty of elliptical-based classes to enjoy, which makes the experience feel much more enjoyable.\nIndeed, where some elliptical trainers can send me to sleep, the instructor in Technogym’s interactive classes will have you hanging off the unit, torching your glutes and pummelling your quads. It will keep you coming back for more.\nThe movement itself takes a bit of getting used to: the stride isn’t quite as obvious as the larger units found in commercial gyms. I had to adapt my approach to get the most out of it, and I found it lacked the multiple grip positions and range of motion for effective upper-body focus training.\nRegardless, this trainer has Technogym quality baked into its core. It offers a huge spread of resistance levels, is virtually silent, and is all wrapped up in one of the most compact, storable and classy units on test.\nIt’s a shame that … you have to bring a device to enjoy a workout, and Technogym’s monthly subscription fees are, predictably, expensive.\nDimensions: 65 x 162 x 160cm (WLH)\nWeight: 100kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive electronically adjustable magnetic resistance\nStride length: not specified\nConnectivity: tablet-compatible console for use with Technogym’s apps\nFolding? Yes (folds to 75cm length for compact storage)\nNoise level: about 36dB\nMaximum user weight: 130kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; designed for tablet use via console\nClassy, quiet and compact\nYou need a separate device for classes\nBest compact cross trainer:\nJTX Strider-X8\nThe JTX Strider-X8 was one of the most compact true ellipticals I got my hands on: it’s just 130cm long. The BowFlex Max Trainer M6 will fit better into tight spaces, but it doesn’t offer the same kind of traditional elliptical stride.\nWhy we love it\nThe Strider-X8 provides 41cm of glorious gliding, corralled by a 7kg inertia-enhanced flywheel at the rear. It’s quiet, although perhaps not as whisper-quiet as some rivals, and offers 16 levels of easily adjustable resistance.\nHowever, there are a few compromises. The compact proportions restrict the maximum user height to 5ft 9in, which means even a vertically challenged individual like myself is butting up against the limits. The build quality isn’t a strong point: the console, complete with basic display, looks and feels a bit like an oversized school calculator. However, this trainer is very much at the budget end of the budget spectrum. JTX offers a two-year at-home warranty, which should give some peace of mind for those worried it may not go the distance.\nWeighing 51kg, the Strider-X8 isn’t something you will want to pick up and heft around, but it’s easy to tip it on to its transport wheels and stash it somewhere convenient. Without going for a foldable, there are few cross trainers that can compete with it in terms of space-saving – and I managed to cram it into the corner of my busy garage with little stress.\nThe workout experience is largely fine, although the smaller footplates will be a problem for users with larger feet. It connects seamlessly with third-party apps and can even be used with virtual training software, such as Zwift.\nThe digital console is basic, but it all works, with a simple dial adjusting the levels of resistance. There are even 18 built-in programs for those who simply want to hop on and work out.\nIt’s a shame that … parts of the machine feel cheap, and the built-in heart-rate monitoring is useless.\nDimensions: 70 x 130 x 169cm (WLH)\nWeight: 51kg\nDrivetrain: 7kg inertia-enhanced flywheel and electromagnetic resistance\nStride length: 41cm\nConnectivity: Bluetooth to fitness apps (such as Kinomap, iConsole+), built-in Polar heart-rate receiver (chest strap), hand pulse sensors\nFolding? No; includes transport wheels\nNoise level: about 38dB\nMaximum user weight: 120kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no; LCD console with 18 workouts\nSuper compact and affordable\nSmall footplates won’t suit larger feet\nBest full-body trainer:\nSchwinn 590 Elliptical\nSchwinn packs a lot into its relatively compact 590 Elliptical, including the ability to electronically adjust the platforms to simulate gradients of -5% to 15%. Along with the multitude of upper-body handles, this sees it bundled into the cross-trainer category (despite its name). I found it offered one of the best full-body workouts on test.\nThere are built-in speakers that are of mediocre quality (they’re better than those found on the Horizon EX-59 but still not brilliant) and a 7in digital display that allows for rapid leaps in resistance.\nWhy we love it\nThere are handle-mounted controls for both the incline/decline and resistance settings, which is a welcome premium touch, and the unit is compatible with a multitude of virtual training software, including Zwift and Schwinn’s recommended Jrny app.\nThe 25 levels of resistance, the ability to adjust the incline and decline, and the multiple grip locations ensure the Schwinn provides one of the best and all-encompassing full-body workouts on test. With a pronated grip on the horizontal handles, I found it possible to work the big muscles of the back and the lats, while a supinated grip on the inner-most handles would place more emphasis on the shoulders and rear deltoid muscles.\nIt’s a similar case for the lower body, as adjusting the decline and incline places a focus on muscles in the legs that I rarely use. Start playing around with body positioning, and it offers all of the benefits of a static hold with dynamic movement.\nOf course, you can adjust the intensity as you want, but I found the unit to be one of the best for working up a sweat. It all comes in one of the most compact and easy-to-store packages on this list, too.\nIt’s a shame that … the built-in speakers aren’t really worth the effort, and it’s an expensive machine.\nDimensions: 86 x 148 x 173cm (WLH)\nWeight: 96kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive with magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (25 levels)\nStride length: 51cm\nConnectivity: Bluetooth (heart-rate enabled and built-in speakers), USB charging port, tablet/media holder, Jrny and app compatibility\nFolding? No; includes transport wheels\nNoise level: about 32dB\nMaximum user weight: 147kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no; a 7in full-colour LCD with workout programs and connectivity\nOne of the best full-body workouts on test\nIt’s expensive, and speakers are mediocre\nThe best of the rest\nSole E35 elliptical cross trainer\nBest for: taller users\nWith a generous 50.8cm stride length and oversized footplates, the Sole E35 is designed for taller and larger users, offering multiple handles and grip positions for a full-body workout.\nTo me, it’s also one of the better-looking elliptical machines on this list, with modern styling and a sleek 10.1in touchscreen to use for a number of built-in workout sessions and longer-term fitness plans, as well as popular streaming apps, such as YouTube, Disney+ and more.\nThere’s a built-in fan for keeping users cool, although it’s not hugely effective, as well as a set of speakers for streaming music. These are perfectly adequate, but don’t expect room-filling sounds.\nThe 9kg flywheel provides plenty of resistance though, and with the FTMS protocol, it syncs up with Zwift and the brand’s own Sole+ app, offering a huge array of virtual workouts.\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s a large and heavy machine that requires plenty of storage space.\nDimensions: 60 x 177 x 177cm (WLH); weight: 110.8kg; drivetrain: front-drive with computer-controlled magnetic ECB resistance (20 levels); stride length: 50.8cm; connectivity: Bluetooth audio speakers, USB charging port, wifi, Sole+ and Kinomap app compatibility, tablet holder, wireless charging pad; folding? No; includes front transport wheels; noise level: about 35db; maximum user weight: 158kg; built-in entertainment: 10.1in touchscreen with built-in apps (YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ and so on), wifi and screen mirroring\nGreat for taller users\nTakes up a lot of space\nMatrix Fitness E30\nBest for: gym quality at home\nIt’s a little tricky to get your head around how the Matrix E30 works. On paper, it’s one of the more compact elliptical trainers I tested, yet it still manages to offer a 51cm stride length. This is all down to the clever, and quite complex, suspension system that houses the oversized footplates and traditional elliptical handles.\nMatrix kit is often found in commercial gyms and that’s pretty obvious here, as the build quality is excellent. It also sports a 10.5kg flywheel, which is one of the heaviest on test. It allows for 20 levels of resistance and is capable of a pretty hardcore workout.\nAn updated XER console has a crisp 10in touchscreen that takes care of most of the functionality, as well as allowing access to a handful of streaming apps and virtual training programs.\nIf you don’t want to pay for yet another monthly membership (Matrix suggests iFIT), it can also play nicely with whatever third-party apps you like to use and features 11 built-in workout programs.\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s expensive, and the screen isn’t overly impressive.\nDimensions: 73x 166 x 148cm (WLH); weight: 126kg; drivetrain: suspension elliptical front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (20 levels); stride length: 51cm; connectivity: wifi, Bluetooth, USB port and entertainment apps (YouTube, Netflix and so on); folding? No; noise level: about 38dB; maximum user weight: 147kg; built-in entertainment: 10in touchscreen with apps, media streaming, web browser (XER console)\nExcellent quality\nThe quality comes at a high price\nLife Fitness E1\nBest for: build quality on a budget\nLife Fitness is another brand often selected by commercial gyms for its reliability, and this also filters down into its domestic range.\nConsidering how basic the E1 feels compared with some rivals, the price seems high, but this is a fuss-free elliptical with a massive fixed stride length, oversized footplates and an impressive spread of smooth and natural-feeling resistance. It’s also quiet.\nThe basic digital Go Console lacks the flashiness of a massive interactive touchscreen, but it has 13 workout programs that are easily accessed via large and obvious buttons, great for those not fussed about binging Netflix during a workout. During testing, I found the lack of a touchscreen quite refreshing: it was easy to hop on and work out without the faff of connecting Bluetooth-enabled devices.\nHeart-rate monitoring is fairly reliable via its handles and sports the FTMS protocol for third-party app integration, but it also works perfectly well without it, and its built-in programs span hill training and fat-burning sessions.\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it feels expensive for what it is and looks dated.\nDimensions: 77 x 209 x 150cm (WLH); weight: 96kg; drivetrain: front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (20 levels); stride length: 51cm; connectivity: Go Console with LCD, Bluetooth telemetry heart-rate monitoring, 13 pre-loaded workouts; folding? No; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 182kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in media apps; simple display for workout metrics and an integrated accessory tray for external device placement\nFuss-free and simple to use\nFeels basic compared with competitors\nWhat you need to know\nWhat is the difference between an elliptical and a cross trainer?\nThe two terms are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences. A standard elliptical machine focuses on the forward and backward pedalling motion with fixed handles, providing a low-impact cardio workout that mimics running without the joint stress. A cross trainer typically includes moving handlebars that allow you to work your upper body as well, giving a more complete, full-body workout. In most modern home fitness equipment, “elliptical” and “cross trainer” usually describe the same type of machine.\nHow much should I spend?\nEntry-level elliptical trainers start at about £400 and offer basic stride motion and limited resistance levels. Spending more than £1,000 typically gets you a sturdier build, smoother motion, more resistance levels and better consoles with Bluetooth or app integration. At the top end (£2,000+), you’ll find commercial-grade machines with advanced consoles, streaming services, more compact footprints, greater levels of resistance and suspension technology that greatly reduces noise and wear.\nHow much room do I need at home?\nEllipticals tend to be large machines, with footprints ranging from about 150cm in length and 70cm in width, all the way up to 200cm in length and 80cm in width, or more. You’ll also need to consider ceiling height – especially with front-drive machines, as pedals can lift you an additional 30-40cm off the ground.\nWhat features should I look out for?\nStride length is a key factor: shorter strides (about 40-45cm) are suitable for smaller users, while taller users will benefit from 50cm or more. Look for adjustable resistance levels and incline options if you want to vary the intensity and muscle groups worked. Consoles with Bluetooth and app support can help track progress and keep workouts engaging, and some higher-end models include large touchscreens with streaming apps, fans, speakers and wireless charging pads. If space is a concern, compact or folding designs are worth exploring.\nAre there any maintenance concerns?\nEllipticals are generally low-maintenance compared with treadmills. Most use magnetic resistance systems that don’t require ongoing adjustment as a treadmill’s belt does. Look out for manufacturer warranties that cover any wear and tear. Suspension ellipticals – which remove the traditional track and wheel system – tend to be even quieter and need virtually no lubrication.\nFor more ways to get fit at home:\nThe best treadmills, tested by our expert runner\nPersonal trainers on the best home exercise kit\nLeon Poultney is a lifelong fitness enthusiast who can often be found trying not to kill himself on a mountain bike/surfboard/other extreme thing, often at the request of an editor.

(Finally).\nIn no particular order, here are the most read feature articles of the year.\nMy chilling week on Roblox: sexually assaulted and shat on as a child avatar roaming the online world\nThe Guardian covered Roblox a lot in 2025, mostly from the perspective of child safety. As Sarah Martin discovered in this article, it is extremely easy to get into inappropriate situations and chats in this free-for-all of a game platform, which has more than 150m daily users (most of them children). I am no fan of Roblox and don’t let my own kids play it, but if your little ones get joy out of it and you don’t want to prohibit the game entirely I recommend making sure it’s supervised where possible and those parental controls are locked down.\nI cannot stop playing this preposterous game about falling down a mountain\nFor some reason this tale of my self-flagellating travails with Baby Steps seemed to speak to a lot of people. I felt somewhat vindicated for spending more than 12 hours of my life marching a useless person up a hill.\nMaster System at 40: the truth about Sega’s most underrated console\nOur games correspondent Keith Stuart, goes down one of his favourite rabbit holes here, emerging with a wonderfully researched tribute to one of Sega’s lesser-appreciated consoles. Revisionist history often crowns the NES as the winner of the 80s console wars, but that was only true in Japan and the US – in Europe, home computers and the Sega Master System reigned.\nElon Musk stands accused of pretending to be good at video games. The irony is delicious\nI must admit that this was extremely satisfying to write. After boasting about his gaming prowess on X, Elon Musk was revealed to have been cheating in some baffling attempt to appropriate gamer credibility. As the year wore on, this proved to be just one of many embarrassing self-owns from the richest man in the world.\nWhy Trump’s White House is using video game memes to recruit for ICE\nGames have a lot of economic and cultural power. They were the original site of the modern online culture wars, during Gamergate, and now the Trump administration isn’t shy to use gamer imagery to mobilise its base. This report from Alyssa Mercante is a story about how Pokémon and Halo imagery is being used to recruit for ICE, but also a story about where games sit now in the wider political context of our times.\nMeet the new James Bond: how 007 First Light earned its licence to thrill\nWho needs Grand Theft Auto: the upcoming game that Guardian readers are most psyched for in 2026 is 007 First Light. Possibly because the films’ future was still up in the air when it was announced, or maybe because the love for GoldenEye 007 still runs deep. Joshua Rivera interviews the people at IO Interactive who persuaded Eon Productions to let them loose on James Bond.\nUnreal estate: the 12 greatest homes in video game history\nList features get a bad rap but this is such a good, thoughtful example of the form, in my (biased) opinion, from Keith Stuart and Christian Donlan. We remember the places we tread in games as if they were real, and some of these virtual mansions feel like childhood homes. (We should be so lucky as to grow up in Croft Manor.)\nGaming in their golden years: why millions of seniors are playing video games\nI know many Pushing Buttons readers are gamers of a certain vintage. Adrienne Matei speaks to some of Twitch’s older video game streamers (much love to TacticalGramma) to find out why half of people over 60 play video games, and the potential benefits of doing so.\nWhy do some gamers invert their controls? Scientists now have answers – but they’re not what you think\nThis story has been ongoing in the Guardian games pages for years, ever since Keith wrote what he thought would be a very niche article querying why some people play games upside down. Finally, after that article inspired an actual scientific study, we have the answer.\nBillion-dollar video game: is this the most expensive piece of entertainment ever made?\nI have been interested in the spaceship game Star Citizen for a long time, mostly because I have wondered where the hundreds of millions of pounds it has raised in funding were actually going. (It’s been “in development” since 2012 and its creators don’t pretend it is anywhere close to finished.) Oliver Holmes talks to players to find out why they have invested thousands in this science-fiction dream. Since this article was published, Star Citizen’s revenue has risen to $924,266,846, and it now has six million players.\nWhat to play\nThis week, I will be playing Guitar Hero and Rock Band, as I have small children and can’t go out for Hogmanay. So instead I’m getting all the ancient plastic instruments out of the attic and bringing the party to me. I can’t insist that you do anything so impractical – last time I tried this I got the dreaded red ring of death on my trusty old Xbox 360 and the whole plan fell apart – but if you do have some forgotten SingStar mics and an old PlayStation two or three hidden away, this is your PSA that all of it still works, and actually it’s just as fun as it was in 2008. Happy new year!\nAvailable on: 2010s console of your choice\nEstimated playtime: Twenty years and counting\nWhat to click\nQuestion Block\nNo reader question this week because we’re all still on holiday, but to kick off 2026, I’d like to invite you to write in with a few sentences on your most anticipated game(s) of the next year.

But then, in the year just past, when bigotry in frontline politics took off its training wheels and othering became the sport that everyone can play, the notion that someone who clearly belongs here should not belong here ceased to shock.\nBad stuff happened in 2025. The big stuff you know: the violent, toxically nativist besieging of asylum seeker hotels and the condoning of it by rightwing politicians and media outlets. The deployment up and down the country by hard-right activists of the British and St George’s flag, as a symbol, not of collective adhesion (as it surely can be) but of intimidation. The very public claims that Farage, a man with pretensions to lead our country, hurt people as a racist school bully and refuses to atone or suitably acknowledge their hurt now that he is a dog-whistling adult.\nBut I’m also thinking of less high-profile stuff. Like the friend who went for a weekend out of London into summery, leafy Middle England and, while waiting at a road junction, was assailed as a “black bitch” by a car passenger waiting at the lights, seeking to prove to an even younger passenger – perhaps his own son – that he wasn’t constrained by the strictures of woke.\nLike the student who, along with his father, entered a pub in the West Country – to sample the local colour, watch a bit of football – and was advised to leave because it wasn’t a good or safe place for “Pakis”. Like the health worker friend whose job entails driving into towns and villages, who continued to do so amid the summer explosion of union flags but who said that as a black man entering those places, he felt, for the first time, the need to watch his back. All were acting as if they belong, with infinite justification. All were given reason to doubt. Diehard populists and racists want that kind of Britain and they’ve had a good year. According to a new study by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), the number of people absorbing and mirroring hard right narratives is rising. Time to take stock: divided, resentful, hostile to all but a default culture – is that the sort of country the rest of us want?\nAgainst this backdrop, and at a time when a small but growing minority says you have to be white to be British, I have been thinking about minority belonging and attachment. I was born here, schooled here, have worked and paid taxes here, have served communities: but as the son of Windrush parents, how solid is my footing here? My late parents arrived in the 1950s and thought their status was secure. Then came the 1971 Immigration Act, which ripped up the rights they had as Commonwealth citizens and necessitated that they scramble to find the money to solidify their status under the government’s new arrangements. As a child I overheard the strained discussions about where the money was going to come from. The sound of shock and uncertainty.\nWe are settled, but never quite cosy. How can we be? Using the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the home secretary can pull the rug out from under a British citizen, without notification, if doing so meets their particular criteria of the public good. Earlier this year, research by the Runnymede Trust suggested that 9 million people – mainly those with dual nationalities – are vulnerable to losing the citizenship they thought was theirs, with minority citizens 12 times more vulnerable than white. This is us: you belong until, maybe, one day, you don’t.\nGo home, Farage’s man said, and with that he echoed the exhortation of choice from nativist crowds outside asylum seeker hotels this summer. In the 50s and 60s, my parents’ generation of Windrush-era migrants used to hear that a lot too. But then, as now, it was a nonsense. Home to where? Where you have lived the longest? To your last port of call? To wherever will have you? We don’t know. That’s why politicians sought to shuttle folk off to Rwanda in the hope they would sort out the home/belonging conundrum themselves.\nWhere am I from? Where’s home if not here? Well certainly there is a quiet, leafy bit of Jamaica that my parents left in the 50s and returned to almost 40 years later. But this year, having paid the fee and explored my DNA, I’ve found there is a viable case that home could be a lot of places. Via Mum, according to the Ancestry results, there are traces from Benin and Togo, with a good bit of Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, a smidgen of Nigeria, a little bit of Mali and a sliver of north-east Scotland. There’s even a drop of Iceland. Go figure.\nFrom Dad, a bit of Benin and Togo, a bit more from Côte d’Ivoire, but most notably Nigeria. I am unsurprised. A Nigerian friend once glanced at a picture of my father and said, never mind Jamaica, “He’s from Nigeria: no question”. But here, again a mix: a chunk of Devon and Somerset, a little bit of Cameroon and Mali. Some Senegal, some Panama and Costa Rica. And then a trace of the Netherlands. Well, I do enjoy trips to Rotterdam.\nI find all this energising, and certainly it challenges the idea that we are identity parcels labelled from one destination, ready to be returned to sender.\nI am not a citizen of nowhere, as demonised by the populists, but through history, politics, cruelty and happenstance, a creature from almost everywhere. My guess is that many of you are the same – and that David Lammy is similar, too.\nThat’s the truth of it, and a conversation about home and belonging that starts from there would undoubtedly be more positive. Let’s have it.\n-\nHugh Muir is executive editor, Opinion", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/01/racist-go-home-place-dna-test-countries", "published_at": "2026-01-01T06:00:33+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Volunteers such as these, Lord Rooker observed, “keep society going”.\nFew would disagree. The Guardian’s Christmas charity appeal showcases similarly vital work being undertaken up and down the country. Yet heading into 2026, this vast network of voluntary organisations faces formidable headwinds and an ominous financial crunch. The prolonged impact of austerity, the pandemic and an ongoing cost of living crisis mean that demand for their services continues to rise. But state funding – both from central government and hollowed-out local authorities – has become more and more inadequate, and charitable giving has declined to the lowest level since tracking began. Fewer people are volunteering, and costs are dramatically up – not least as a result of the rise in employers’ national insurance contributions, which kicked in last April.\nFor some of the country’s household name charities, this perfect storm ensured that 2025 was an annus horribilis. The mental health charity Samaritans announced in July that it would close half of its 200 branches. Macmillan Cancer Support has shed a quarter of its staff and scaled back hardship grants. Other jobs have been – or are at risk of being – lost at Oxfam and the counselling charity Relate. Institutions such as the National Trust have been targeted by “anti-woke” campaigners more interested in stoking culture wars than safeguarding the viability of a crucial component of the public realm.\nCivic reckoning\nAt the other end of the scale, thousands of smaller grassroots organisations are simply struggling to stay afloat, digging into reserves and cutting services. A survey by Voluntary Norfolk in the summer found that half of the county’s charities feared they would be forced to let staff go. Burnout in overstretched and insecure workplaces is a growing concern.\nA Labour government aspiring to place such organisations at the heart of civic renewal should treat this state of affairs as a scandal and a challenge. In July, Sir Keir Starmer launched the civil society covenant – continuing with the post-2010 framing of the non-state, non-market sphere as one shaped not only by formal charities and non-profits, but by community and faith groups too. But much-needed collaboration will not flourish on the basis of warm words alone.\nA reset, not for the first time, is needed. The modern history of voluntarism has been one of cultural reinvention, and shifting boundaries of responsibility in relation to Whitehall. In the 1960s and 1970s, a new wave of campaigning charities professionalised the sector and shone a light on the deficiencies and outdated approaches of the postwar welfare state. Organisations such as the Child Poverty Action Group, Shelter and Friends of the Earth acted as critical friends to Labour governments, for which they constituted a radical hinterland and crucial source of ideas.\nCounter-revolution followed, as Conservative administrations shrank the state and appealed to virtuous citizens to fill the void. Margaret Thatcher’s putative revival of “Victorian values” in the 1980s, and David Cameron’s “big society” in the 2010s, promoted the moral superiority of individual and communal self-reliance over debilitating “welfare dependency”. That, at least, was the self‑serving political narrative. The disastrous social consequences of recession and austerity were meanwhile dumped at the doors of churches and charities that were ill-equipped to cope.\nBy contrast, Sir Keir’s notion of a covenantal relationship carries promising echoes of New Labour’s earlier idea of a “compact”. As chancellor in the 2000s, Gordon Brown presided over a boom in contract funding to voluntary welfare providers and a new focus on social enterprises – both viewed as vehicles through which to expand choice and deepen civic engagement. Taking inspiration from the celebrated US sociologist Robert Putnam, whose work spoke to an early communitarian strand in New Labour thinking, Mr Brown hailed “a quiet revolution in how voluntary action and charitable work serve the community”.\nUnderfunded but indispensable\nThat was then, though, before the 2008 crash inaugurated two lost decades of flatlining growth and pared-back Whitehall budgets. Politically polarised, preoccupied with issues of social cohesion, and dealing with the costs of an ageing population, Britain is now in dire need of a new golden age of voluntarism. But the current financial squeeze on charities, which the government has done too little to address, is pointing in the opposite direction. For the majority of charities regularly surveyed by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, grants and contracts have not covered costs since 2020. Worryingly for the future, donations have dipped most steeply among the young, with “affordability” cited as the principal factor behind the decline.\nFor its idea of a “covenant” to mean anything, Labour must begin to find ways to ensure the voluntary sector can access both the financial resources and the human resources it needs. As countless studies have attested, the country’s 160,000‑plus charities contribute to the economy not only directly, but through preventive action that saves the state money it would otherwise spend when problems turn into crises. Properly valuing that latter contribution would, in itself, justify a transformative injection of funds into their coffers.\nA sector which is a proven social and economic asset deserves better than a constant, failing battle to do more with less. Charities are trusted by users in a way that the state and local councils are not, and their priorities are not distorted by the profit-seeking motives of market‑based providers. At a grassroots level, this unique position can allow them to be pathfinders and pioneers, forging deep and creative connections with the communities in which they are embedded. The government rightly talks up the prospect of an alliance that will empower the voluntary sector to fulfil its proper vocation. In 2026, it will be time to walk the walk.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
