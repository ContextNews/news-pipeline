Mamdani's astonishing rise over the last year took him from a marginal role as a backbench New York state lawmaker to the pinnacle of power in the largest city in the U.S.\n\"Thank you so much to everyone for being here, Happy New Year to New Yorkers,\" Mamdani said, flashing his trademark grin. \"This is truly the honor and privilege of a lifetime.\"\nThe oath was administered by New York state Attorney General Letitia James, a fellow Democrat and a close Mamdani ally. \"Congratulations, Mr. Mayor,\" she said, to cheers.\nA much larger public ceremony will be held later on New Year's Day on the steps of City Hall, with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders — one of Mamdani's political mentors — and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez expected to take part.\nAn immigrant's victory, a focus on affordability\nAn immigrant born in Uganda to parents with roots in India, Mamdani's political triumph in 2025 came at a time when President Trump and his top advisors were rapidly reshaping U.S. policy to sharply limit immigration, especially for Muslims and people from African countries.\nMamdani's critics, including Trump but also many leaders in the Democratic Party, also raised concerns about his membership in the Democratic Socialists of America as well as his frequent criticism of Israel and the war in Gaza.\nTrump falsely described Mamdani as a \"communist\" and said his growing influence was \"a disaster waiting to happen. We can't have a communist in charge of a great, supposedly free enterprise kind of a representative city,\" he said.\nThose attacks didn't slow Mamdani's march to victory. In the general election, he defeated Andrew Cuomo, once a Democratic Party titan, by nearly ten points.\n\"The future is in our hands,\" Mamdani said during his victory speech in November. \"In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light.\"\nMuch of Mamdani's campaign focused on kitchen table issues and affordability. He promised free bus service, universal child care, government-run grocery stores, and a freeze on rents for apartments that fall under the city's authority.\nWhile focusing on pocket book concerns, Mamdani also managed to charm many of his early opponents, building a broad coalition of supporters — many of them young — and winning endorsements from some of New York City's most influential Jewish leaders.\nIn a meeting that followed his November win, even Trump promised to support Mamdani, despite his harsh rhetoric during the campaign: \"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him - a big help, because I want New York City to be great,\" Trump said.\nAchieving Mamdani's ambitious campaign promises won't be easy. Many of his proposals require corporate and personal tax hikes for the wealthy, which won't happen without support from more centrist Democrats in Albany, the state capital. But New York Governor Kathy Hochul has already signaled support for Mamdani's goal of free childcare.\nMamdani has also drawn praise for building a management team that includes experienced veterans — including his decision to keep NYPD commissioner Jessica Tisch in his cabinet. But there have been missteps. Last month, one of Mamdani's top appointments withdrew after the Anti-Defamation League surfaced social media posts from more than a decade ago widely viewed as insensitive and anti-Semitic.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2026/01/01/nx-s1-5663372/zohran-mamdani-sworn-in-as-new-york-city-mayor-capping-historic-rise", "published_at": "2026-01-01T00:58:09-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

As per Rose Parade rules, every inch of the float must be decorated with only natural, organic materials.\nBlue waves sweep up into the tailfeathers of the design's symbolic centerpiece:\n\"A phoenix, rising,\" the 76-year-old described, looking up at the representation of the mythical bird born from ashes. \"And that's how we all feel, that we're going to rise above this and rebuild and bring back our communities.\"\nNearly a year ago, the Eaton Fire tore through whole neighborhoods including Leyba's, leaving behind an ashy forest of chimneys not far from the parade route, just one week after the 2025 New Year's Day celebration. The grandstand was still up, covered in windblown debris as Leyba's home burned down.\n\"I told the kids, pack an overnight bag, we'll be back tomorrow,\" she remembered. \"We never came back, and we never said goodbye to our home.\"\nBut she's finding her community again through work on the float, which is decorated entirely by fire survivors.\nThe Rose Parade is a New Year's Day tradition for millions of viewers who tune in on TV to see the creative displays of Southern California's natural bounty roll through the streets of Pasadena. For locals, it has long been a point of pride to be included among the many float crews, marching bands, and equestrian performers that have participated in the event since the first Tournament of Roses in 1890.\n\"I'm going, my God, I'm representing Altadena, all these people who have lost their homes and live in the community,\" marveled Leyba. \"So, it's an honor.\"\n\"It's really kind of a living memorial of beautiful flowers and organic material, in a very LA experience that the world is watching,\" said Miguel Santana, CEO of California Community Foundation, a charity organization that funds wildfire recovery and sponsored the float.\nSantana said many survivors are having a tough time as the anniversary of the fires approaches.\n\"People are really starting to feel a real mental breakdown,\" he said. \"Folks are really struggling to navigate an insurance system that is failing them. For many people, the fact that the federal government hasn't provided the relief that it has for other natural disasters around the country, they're struggling.\"\nIn addition to reminding the nation of the ongoing need for assistance, Santana hoped the float would be a healing way to bring survivors together and create something beautiful to mark the moment.\n\"One person shared today that this is the first event that he's attended following the fires,\" Santana recalled. \"He had lost his sister and was reluctant to go to anything, but because the Rose Parade is such a part of his own life being from Altadena, it felt right.\"\nThat survivor decorated one of 31 sunflowers; each represents someone who died in the fires. During construction in the float barn, the honor of installing the sunflowers was reserved for surviving friends and family, many of whom shared stories of their loved ones as they worked.\n\"We're hoping that, even for just one day, when they see that float going down a street that they're all familiar with, that they know that the world does care about them, that they're not alone in their journey of grief,\" says Santana.\n\"At first, it was very taxing to be around people,\" said Myra Berg, a survivor of the Palisades Fire. \"But when I look around me and see other people who have lost their homes or who have smoke damage, I want to help.\"\nBerg said she liked being up high in the scaffolds, working on the phoenix.\n\"I enjoyed the hell out of it!\"\nLike many of the volunteers, it's not the only construction project she's got going on right now — she hopes to have her Malibu home rebuilt around this time next year — but the speed at which the float has come together is gratifying compared to the slow pace of permitting and rebuilding a house.\n\"Another reporter asked if working on the float has been therapeutic. And I thought, 'Oh, therapeutic! I'm moving forward at this point,\" Berg jokes.\n\"I think it's good for the world to know that there is something that honors the survivors and the victims. People forget that these things happen. It's a nice way to reach out and say, 'Yes, we're ok.

A public inauguration in the afternoon has been planned to take place near City Hall, followed by a block party.\nJames said on social media that she was honored to swear in Mamdani at the historic subway station: \"Our subways connect us all, and they represent exactly what our next mayor is fighting for: a city every New Yorker can thrive in,\" she wrote.\nA relic of civic innovation\nTrains first departed the City Hall station on Oct. 27, 1904, as the first stop on the city's first subway line.

Previous attacks have been in the Caribbean Sea and in the eastern Pacific Ocean.\nA video of Tuesday's attack posted by Southern Command on social media shows three boats traveling in a close formation, which is unusual, and the military said they were in a convoy along known narco-trafficking routes and \"had transferred narcotics between the three vessels prior to the strikes.\" The military did not provide evidence to back up the claim.\nThe military said three people were killed when the first boat was struck, while people in the other two boats jumped overboard and distanced themselves from the vessels before they were attacked. Southern Command said it immediately notified the U.S. Coast Guard to activate search and rescue efforts.\nSouthern Command's statement did not say whether those who jumped off the boats were rescued.\nCalling in the Coast Guard is notable because the U.S. military drew heavy scrutiny after U.S. forces killed the survivors of an attack in early September with a follow-up strike to their disabled boat. Some Democratic lawmakers and legal experts said the military committed a crime, while the Trump administration and some Republican lawmakers say the follow-up strike was legal.\nU.S. forces attacked two more boats on Wednesday, killing five people who were allegedly smuggling drugs along known trafficking routes, Southern Command said in a separate statement. It did not provide evidence of the alleged trafficking or reveal the body of water in which the attacks occurred.

The document shows how Smith during the course of a daylong deposition repeatedly defended the basis for pursuing indictments against Trump and vigorously rejected Republican suggestions that his investigations were politically motivated.\n\"The evidence here made clear that President Trump was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy. These crimes were committed for his benefit. The attack that happened at the Capitol, part of this case, does not happen without him. The other co-conspirators were doing this for his benefit,\" Smith said, bristling at a question about whether his investigations were meant to prevent Trump from reclaiming the presidency in 2024.\n\"So in terms of why we would pursue a case against him, I entirely disagree with any characterization that our work was in any way meant to hamper him in the presidential election,\" he added.\nThe Dec. 17 deposition was conducted privately despite Smith's request to testify publicly. The release of the transcript and video of the interview, so far Smith's only appearance on Capitol Hill since leaving his special counsel position last January, adds to the public understanding of the decision-making behind two of the most consequential Justice Department investigations in recent history.\nTrump was indicted on charges of conspiring to undo the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and of willfully retaining classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both cases were abandoned after Trump's 2024 election win, with Smith citing Justice Department policy against the indictment of a sitting president.\nSmith repeatedly made clear his belief that the evidence gathered against Trump was strong enough to sustain a conviction. Part of the strength of the Jan. 6 case, Smith said, was the extent to which it relied on the testimony of Trump allies and supporters who cooperated with the investigation.\n\"We had an elector in Pennsylvania who is a former congressman, who was going to be an elector for President Trump, who said that what they were trying to do was an attempt to overthrow the government and illegal,\" Smith said. \"Our case was built on, frankly, Republicans who put their allegiance to the country before the party.\"\nAccounts from Republicans willing to stand up against the falsehood that the election had been stolen \"even though it could mean trouble for them\" created what Smith described as the \"most powerful\" evidence against Trump.\nWhen it came to the Capitol riot itself, Smith said, the evidence showed that Trump \"caused it and that he exploited it and that it was foreseeable to him.\"\nAsked whether there was evidence that Trump had instructed supporters to riot at the Capitol, Smith said that Trump in the weeks leading to the insurrection got \"people to believe fraud claims that weren't true.\"\n\"He made false statements to state legislatures, to his supporters in all sorts of contexts and was aware in the days leading up to Jan. 6th that his supporters were angry when he invited them and then he directed them to the Capitol,\" Smith said.\n\"Now, once they were at the Capitol and once the attack on the Capitol happened, he refused to stop it. He instead issued a tweet that without question in my mind endangered the life of his own vice president,\" he added. \"And when the violence was going on, he had to be pushed repeatedly by his staff members to do anything to quell it.\"\nSome of the deposition focused on Republican anger at revelations that the Smith team had obtained, and analyzed, phone records of GOP lawmakers who were in contact with Trump on Jan. 6. Smith defended the maneuver as lawful and by-the-book, and suggested that outrage over the tactic should be directed at Trump and not his team of prosecutors.\n\"Well, I think who should be accountable for this is Donald Trump. These records are people, in the case of the senators, Donald Trump directed his co-conspirators to call these people to further delay the proceedings. He chose to do that,\" Smith said. If Donald Trump had chosen to call a number of Democratic senators, we would have gotten toll records for Democratic senators.\"\nThe communications between Trump and Republican supporters in Congress were an important component of the case, Smith said. He cited an interview his office did with Mark Meadows in which Trump's former chief of staff referenced that Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican and current chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, had been in touch with the White House on the afternoon of the riot.\n\"And what I recall was Meadows stating that 'I've never seen Jim Jordan scared of anything,' and the fact that we were in this different situation now where people were scared really made it clear that what was going on at the Capitol could not be mistaken for anything other than what it was,\" Smith said.\nSmith was also asked whether his team evaluated former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson's explosive claim that Trump that grabbed at the steering wheel of the presidential SUV when the Secret Service refused to let him go to the Capitol after a rally at the Ellipse on Jan. 6, 2021.\nSmith told lawmakers that investigators interviewed the officer who was in the car, \"who said that President Trump was very angry and wanted to go to the Capitol,\" but the officer's version of events \"was not the same as what Cassidy Hutchinson said she heard from somebody secondhand.\"", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2025/12/31/g-s1-104190/capitol-riot-trump-jack-smith-transcript", "published_at": "2025-12-31T21:15:19-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Guard members left California after a sharp rebuke from a U.S. District Court judge earlier this month.

While the show is a work of fiction, theoretical wormholes have making appearances for decades not only in science fiction but in actual science.", "content": "What Stranger Things gets right about wormholes\nThe wormhole concept is explained in the fifth season of Stranger Things when science teacher Scott Clarke — played by Randy Havens –– tries to get his class interested in it. \"What's neat about wormholes?\" he asks them, standing in front of a chalkboard.\nHis star student, Erica — played by Priah Ferguson — eagerly raises her hand.\n\"They allow matter to travel between galaxies or dimensions without crossing the space between,\" she says from the front row.\nThe story is set in Indiana in a fictional town called Hawkins that gets caught up with a paranormal world and its various villains. Much of Stranger Things is a love letter to the 80s; this scene is straight out of a John Hughes movie.\nCredit for its scientific underpinnings however, goes to Albert Einstein.\nWhat is a wormhole?\nWormholes are a staple of Hollywood and science fiction — a handy device for any kind of space or time travel. They make appearances in places including the writing of Carl Sagan, Star Trek, or the 2014 film Interstellar.\n\"Just think of all the places mankind could go,\" Haven says in wonder during the Stranger Things classroom scene. \"Another galaxy, another time even.\"\nThe wormhole concept emerged from Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Theoretical physicists still use it to explore scientific questions today. \"It's a hugely interesting and helpful toy model for physicists to play with,\" says Sean Carroll, professor of theoretical physics at Johns Hopkins University.\nAt the core of Einstein's theory is the idea that the universe is basically a single swath of fabric, with space and time woven into one continuum. In 1935, Einstein and his colleague Nathan Rosen found a mathematical solution that suggested this spacetime continuum could form a kind of tunnel connecting two distant points, called an Einstein-Rosen bridge. Later physicists realized that such a tunnel — now called a wormhole — could act like a cosmic shortcut.\n\" If you travel faster than the speed of light, then there's really no difference between traveling to the future and traveling to the past,\" says Carroll.\nCarroll and other scientists stress that wormholes are theoretical. There are many practical obstacles to their existence. But as a device — whether for plot or for science — their applications are endless. \"You can use them to study quantum entanglement and its relationship to emergent space time,\" he says.\nWormholes: Connecting hard science and pop culture\nPhysicist John Archibald Wheeler used the term wormhole in 1957; it was popularized when the astronomer and planetary scientist Carl Sagan wrote about wormholes as a way to facilitate interstellar travel in his novel Contact.\nSince then, says Carroll, Hollywood and the field of physics have had a kind of symbiotic relationship around wormholes. \" The pop-culture need for a way to get across space very, very quickly has actually been a big reason why physicists talk about wormholes all the time these days,\" he says.\nIn 1988, theoretical physicists Kip Thorne and Michael Morris published a scientific investigation into the existence of wormholes. Their work showed that wormholes would require exotic forms of matter to hold them open — making them impossible to exist or traverse.\nNo matter to Hollywood writers, who continued to lean on them for interstellar travel. Today they are a much loved trope. Carroll has been a consultant to directors and writers on the subject, including those of the 2011 film Thor. In a meeting with the director, he remembers offering a wormhole as a device to get Thor from Earth to another planet quickly. \"They said, 'We can't call it a wormhole, that sounds too '80s,'\" he recalls.\nIn the movie, a scientist played by Natalie Portman's character uses the original name, Einstein-Rosen bridge. When another character asks what that is, she clarifies, \"it's a wormhole.\"\n\"So yes,\" says Carroll, \"it's completely entered the popular imagination.\"\nIn 2022, a wormhole controversy broke out when a team of physicists published a paper in the journal Nature that claimed they created a kind of holographic wormhole using Google's quantum computer chip, Sycamore. Scientists objected to their characterization, pointing out that it could mislead the public into thinking it proved the existence of actual wormholes.\n\"They were doing kind of very straightforward things that just used standard quantum mechanics, making various kinds of exotic conjectures,\" says Peter Woit, who teaches mathematics at Columbia University.\nWormholes, he says, are a known and tempting intoxicant to the public.\n\"They had a whole well-thought-out publicity campaign,\" he says, which he calls \"scientifically dubious,\" but \"incredibly effective.\"\nBeyond the wormhole\nThe Stranger Things fever has also taken hold in the UK, says Carsten Welsch, a professor of physics at University of Liverpool. Welsch regularly takes advantage of his students' enthusiasm by using the series and concepts like wormholes in the classroom.\n\" It's a really good way to talk about science, which can be quite a challenge, especially with, with teenagers,\" he says. \"Normally the moment you mention physics or engineering, they run away.\"\nHe started using the show for instruction after his daughter told him he could no longer rely on Star Wars to help explain the principles of physics. \"She told me I have to do something different because that doesn't connect with everybody,\" he says. \"And she loves Stranger Things.\"\nWelsch admires the show's use of many of the principles of science and theoretical physics, beyond the wormhole. The world of the upside down — which figures largely into the plot — he calls \"nearly a perfect analogy\" for the idea of antimatter research.\nIn the show, the upside down is a mirror image to the physical world, existing in a dimension below the Earth. \"The anti-particle is a mirror image to the particle,\" he explains. \" When you overlay some of these images, you can literally picture exactly what's going on in the show as it happens in our labs.\"\nWelsch is grateful to the creators of Stranger Things for folding these scientific concepts into the show, and says parsing what about their representations is true or possible creates an opportunity for rich inquiry. \" It's basically opening a dialogue about — are there maybe other forces? Are there things that we do not understand in the universe?\"\nThe nerds are the ones saving the world in this series. In the Stranger Things classroom scene, Erica's classmates are too cool or too bored to care about wormholes.

{"article_id": "1959c4f36c31425c", "source": "npr", "headline": "Meet five new species discovered in 2025", "body": "A bumpy snailfish, Andean mouse opossum and ancient sea cow were just some of the many species described in 2025.", "content": "Meet five new species discovered in 2025\nEven as some scientists search for signs of life beyond Earth, other researchers have been discovering new species on our own humble planet faster than ever before.\nFrom high up in the mountains to the deep sea, take a tour across the world to meet five new species discovered in 2025.\nAn ancient sea cow in the Persian Gulf\nCows often get a bad rap for contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, but a newly discovered species of their ocean counterparts suggests that sea cows have been key contributors to a natural climate change solution for the past 21 million years.\nThis long-extinct sea cow's fossil remains were discovered in Al Maszhabiya, Qatar, which is now known to be the richest fossil sea cow deposit in the world. Like today's manatees and dugongs, it mainly grazed on seagrass and was considered an \"ecosystem engineer\" in the coastal waters of the Persian Gulf, where it primarily lived.\nWith their fleshy muzzles, these mammals would browse the seafloor, grab the plants, and use their tusks to snip the roots and eat them. In the process, they lift up nutrients from the seafloor that would otherwise be buried, which other animals in the ecosystem can use. These nutrients, in addition to the sea cow's excrement, help cultivate a healthier and more diverse ecosystem.\n\"Supporting seagrass communities through ecosystem engineering is a great natural climate solution, because seagrass communities store an incredible amount of carbon,\" says Nicholas Pyenson, curator of fossil marine mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.\nThe name of the new species, Salwasiren qatarensis, honors the fossil's discovery site in Qatar, and the Bay of Salwa in the Persian Gulf, where the largest herd of dugongs can be found today. But Pyenson says Salwa, an Arabic word which roughly translates to \"solace,\" is also a nod to the potential for the new species to \"elevate the visibility and protection of natural heritage,\" adding that \"natural heritage doesn't actually, in all cases, respect geopolitical boundaries.\"\nPyenson is referring to the fact that the seagrass meadow in the Bay of Salwa spans the coasts of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. His colleagues are currently in the process of applying for UNESCO World Heritage status to protect the region.\n\"This is a great example of science diplomacy,\" Pyenson says, \"where data sharing, making data open access and available when you publish, has the potential to actually form a metaphorical bridge between countries that maybe have not historically seen eye to eye.\"\nYou can see a 3D model of the sea cow fossil here.\nA mini marsupial in the Andes Mountains\nA beady-eyed mouse opossum living high up in the Peruvian Andes wasn't what Silvia Pavan initially set out to find during her expedition in Río Abiseo National Park, but the new species gives yet another reason why this special region is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nPavan, an assistant professor at Cal Poly Humboldt, was on the hunt for a specific squirrel species when she and her colleagues came across an animal they eventually named Marmosa chachapoya to honor the Chachapoya people who formerly occupied the area.\nThe tiny marsupial (which, despite its scientific name, is not a marmoset) was the first small mammal that the researchers collected on their trip. While the animal looked a lot like a mouse opossum, its long and delicate snout and home high in the mountains set it apart from other marmosa species. But once Pavan brought the samples back, DNA analysis — coupled with a close examination of its skull — proved that this was indeed a new species.\nThe high-altitude area of the mountains where the expedition took place is difficult to access, but Pavan says these underexplored areas are even more important to study: \"We do not know yet completely what we have, and it highlights how much we still need to explore and study the area, and how unique and important [it] is for biodiversity.\"\nWith the threat of climate change and human impact, Pavan says, \"the species are being lost before we know they exist.\"\nOn this trip alone, the team of researchers collected roughly 100 different specimens that they are continuing to identify.\nAn undercover spider in Northern California\nMarshal Hedin was walking along the river near where he grew up in Northern California when he came across a spider he hadn't seen before. Fifteen years later, the professor of biology at San Diego State University finally got to identify it as a new species of an entirely new genus, which he named after his home of Siskiyou County.\nBrown spider species like Siskiyu armilla are very difficult to tell apart using only their physical characteristics. Many species look similar because they live in the same kind of habitat: under rocks or in other dark, humid places.\nTo make sure the spider Hedin found was genetically different from existing species, he and his colleagues decided to perform a DNA analysis. So he returned to the river to search for a new specimen of the rare spider (and brought his son along with him too).\nCoauthor Rodrigo Monjaraz Ruedas, an assistant curator of entomology at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles who focused on the DNA analysis, was surprised to find that there was such a huge diversity of spider species in the area.\nHe says that if we simply assume that spiders that look similar are the same species without actually examining their DNA, \"we're going to be missing a lot of the actual diversity these spiders have.\"\nCalifornia plays an especially important role in this diversity, according to Monjaraz Ruedas. As part of a project from the California Institute of Biodiversity, which hasn't yet been published, he has found that close to 40% of the total number of described species of spiders in the U.S. can be found in the state.\nHedin, who was once oblivious to the diversity of species his home boasts, says that this journey has brought him full circle: \"Now I know that it's a very unique place.\" He hopes that this discovery shows the other folks living along the river how special their home is.\nAnd \"this is just the tip of the iceberg,\" Monjaraz Ruedas says, because they're still examining 40 to 50 other spiders that might also be new species.\nA smiley snailfish from the deep sea\nNearly 11,000 feet into the deep sea, scientists discovered a new species that caught the attention — and affection — of viewers from around the world. The bumpy snailfish was captured on video by researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute during their expedition off the shores of Central California — and with its big eyes, feathery fins and a mouth bearing the suggestion of a smile, it was an instant hit.\nTo help determine if the floppy pink sea creature was new or one of the 400 existing species of snailfish, they assembled a team of scientists, including Mackenzie Gerringer, an associate professor of biology at the State University of New York at Geneseo.\nEven though Gerringer has \"never met a snailfish [she] didn't love,\" she knows that the deep sea, where some of the species live, is seen as a bit of an alien environment by many people, which can come with a negative connotation.\nShe says the new species can help people question their assumptions about the deep sea because \"you're left with these fishes that are, in my opinion, quite cute, and they really look quite fragile in an environment that we think of as being very harsh.\"\nThe research team also identified two other species of snailfish, which Gerringer says highlights just how much there still is to learn about the deep sea.\nWhile discovering a new species can be very exciting, Gerringer believes the importance of the practice goes beyond that.\n\"It's critical to know who is in these ecosystems, so that we can understand how they're working, so that we can protect habitats like the deep sea that we know play hugely important roles,\" she says. Some of those roles, including the deep sea's ability to store enormous amounts of carbon, are especially important given the threat of climate change.\nLive-birthing toads in Tanzania\nMany people remember learning about the typical life cycle of frogs and toads in elementary school: Eggs turn into tadpoles, which eventually become adults. But scientists have found three new species of toads in Tanzania that do something very unusual: they give birth to live young.\nAnother striking thing about these new species, which are all part of the genus Nectophrynoides: The journey to discover them took over 100 years. The first toad in this genus was described in the early 1900s, and because all the specimens collected looked so similar, they were all thought to belong to a singular species.\nBut Christoph Liedtke, an academic researcher from the Spanish National Research Council who has spent the last decade studying these toads, wondered whether there was more biodiversity in the highlands of the Eastern Arc mountains of Tanzania than previously thought. So he and his colleagues tried to see if there was more than one species in the Nectophrynoides genus.\nThis was no easy task because many of the specimens they needed to examine and compare to modern-day samples were collected before the time of DNA sequencing. Coauthor John Lyakurwa, an assistant lecturer at the University of Dar es Salaam, says that the process was like a \"big puzzle that we had to solve.\"\nSo they teamed up with researchers from Denmark and Belgium to extract DNA from over 200 museum specimens. From there, they used next-generation sequencing to identify three new species in the genus, which was more than previously thought.\nIt's not clear how these toads will fare in the future. Like many species, their populations are in decline, with one species already extinct and others not being spotted for the past 20 years. For his PhD thesis, Lyakurwa has been focusing on understanding why these toad populations have been shrinking. Especially because of their unusual method of reproduction, he stresses that \"if we lose them, we lose a very big evolutionary history.\"", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2025/12/31/nx-s1-5662605/five-new-species-discovered-2025", "published_at": "2025-12-31T14:20:59-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

He participated in a White House roundtable in October.", "content": "What to know about Nick Shirley, the YouTuber alleging day care fraud in Minnesota\nThe Trump administration is freezing child care funding to the state of Minnesota in response to a viral video that purports to expose extensive fraud by federally funded day care centers.\nNick Shirley, a 23-year-old self-described \"independent YouTube journalist,\" posted the 42-minute video on X and YouTube the day after Christmas.\nIn it, he and an older man — identified only as \"David\" — visit various seemingly empty day care centers, bombarding Somali employees with questions and accusing them of not providing services to any children despite receiving public funds. The pair claim to have exposed over $110 million in fraud.\nAllegations of social services fraud in Minnesota have been the subject of federal investigations and mainstream media coverage for years.\nIn one high-profile example, more than 90 individuals have been charged since 2022 in the ongoing case of a Minnesota nonprofit that prosecutors say misappropriated some $250 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds intended to feed children in need, calling it \"the largest Covid-19 fraud scheme in the country.\"\nAnd a federal prosecutor said earlier this month that half or more of the roughly $18 billion in federal funds that supported 14 Minnesota-run programs since 2018 may have been stolen.\nHowever, Shirley's specific allegations have not been verified, with some challenging them in recent days. The manager of one Minnesota day care center has since said Shirley visited outside of its regular hours, while a CNN camera crew interviewing Shirley outside a different center filmed caregivers dropping off their kids in the background (he dismissed them as \"showing face\").\n\"How do I know that [the allegations are] true?\" Shirley responded when asked. \"Well, we showed you guys what was happening, and then you guys can go ahead and make your own analysis.\"\nThe lack of evidence hasn't stopped a number of prominent conservatives — including Elon Musk and key members of the Trump administration — from amplifying and acting on Shirley's claims. As of Wednesday, Shirley's video has over 131 million views on X and 2.5 million on YouTube.\nVice President Vance reposted Shirley's video the day after it went live, writing, \"This dude has done far more useful journalism than any of the winners of the 2024 [Pulitzer] prizes.\" (Those prizes went to journalists who covered a range of topics, from billionaires' influence over the Supreme Court to catastrophic flooding in California and missing Black girls and women in Chicago.)\nFBI Director Kash Patel also responded, writing on X that \"even before the public conversation escalated online, the FBI had surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs.\"\nShirley, suddenly in the national spotlight, has expressed concerns about his safety and is asking supporters to donate to his security, including by selling $50 sweatshirts on his website. And he's continued to criticize Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and the mainstream media for their perceived inaction on the issue.\n\"Mainstream media is more mad at me then they are at the FACT that billions of YOUR dollars are being used for fraudulent business,\" Shirley tweeted Wednesday. \"I am not an enemy of the people, they are. I'm with you, they are against you.\"\nShirley started out as a vlogger\nShirley has been making shock-value YouTube videos for years, starting with pranks before wading into political exposés.\nThe Utah native vlogged consistently throughout high school, amassing some 7,000 followers before graduating in 2020, according to a profile that year from local NBC affiliate KSL-TV.\n\"Some people might not know who Nick Shirley is yet, but one day, they will,\" it reads.\nOne of his earliest stunts was flying to New York City at age 16 without telling his parents. They escalated from there: sneaking into influencer Jake Paul's wedding, tricking TikTokkers into auditioning for a fake Justin Bieber music video, riding a bike over a ramp lit on fire. He also filmed himself in the crowd outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.\nThen came a hiatus: Shirley announced in December 2021 that he would be taking a two-year break from YouTube to serve on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Santiago, Chile.\nHe returned to the platform in 2023 with a video interviewing undocumented immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona. From that point on, his work took on a decidedly political bent, with man-on-the-street style interviews focused on topics including illegal immigration, the 2024 election, President Trump's deployment of federal troops to blue cities and the ensuing protests against them.\nHis two most-viewed videos are from this period, filmed from the El Salvadoran mega-prison housing deportees alleged to be gang members and another in Rio de Janeiro, titled \"I Infiltrated Rio Brazil's Most Dangerous Gang.\"\nThe description of his YouTube Channel — which has 1.29 million subscribers as of Wednesday — reads: \"Here to entertain and bring the truth to all.\"\nAn \"independent journalist\" with an agenda\nShirley's rise to prominence hit a new milestone in October, when he was invited to participate in a White House roundtable about the \"antifa\" movement — the far-left ideology opposed to fascism, which Trump has designated a domestic terrorist organization.\nAt the event, Shirley introduced himself as a \"100% independent YouTube journalist\" and said that while he's traveled to 15 countries for that work, \"the most dangerous place I've been has been here in the United States\" because of anti-Trump protests.\n\"I'm attacked every time I do my job,\" he said, without citing specifics. \"When I leave my house to go to work, I'm violently assaulted. I've been bear sprayed and beaten down. I've been almost killed.\"\nAccording to recent research from the Harvard Kennedy School, the thousands of local protests during Trump's second term have yielded an \"extremely low number of injuries, property damage or arrests.\"\nShirley directly accused the mainstream media — particularly broadcasters — of undercovering and downplaying the violence of those protests. Trump responded by asking him to name the worst offenders, to which Shirley replied: \"I'm not talking about Fox … Newsmax or any outlet that resembles them.\"\nShirley is part of a broader group of right-leaning journalists and political commentators who do not work for any particular outlet. The White House has embraced what it calls \"new media,\" giving them unprecedented levels of access at the same time as it places restrictions on established journalistic outlets.\nUniversity of Minnesota media law professor Jane Kirtley told member station MPR News that individuals do not necessarily need a formal affiliation to do fine journalism. But she says many of today's news influencers prioritize fearmongering over fact-checking, something she says she observes in Shirley's reporting.\n\"They have a narrative, and they do everything they can to advance that narrative, but they seem to spend little to no time looking for the other side of the story, and that's what good investigative journalism has to do,\" she added.\nCorrection Dec. 31, 2025\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly said Nick Shirley and his colleague claimed to have uncovered $110,000 in fraud.

Olive, North Carolina.\nSCOTT DETROW, HOST:\nAcross the country, cities and towns are preparing to drop all kinds of objects at midnight to mark the first moments of the New Year. In Lebanon, Pennsylvania, it is giant baloney attached to a disco ball. And that might be a good pairing with Mount Olive, North Carolina. Member station WFAE's Nick de la Canal takes us there as they prepare for tonight's big moment.\nNICK DE LA CANAL, BYLINE: OK, so I'm standing in the Pickle Parlor of downtown Mount Olive, North Carolina, about to see the town's most famous object, the New Year's Eve pickle.\nI'm so excited. Shall we go check it out?\nLYNN WILLIAMS: Sure.\nDE LA CANAL: Lynn Williams is showing me around the pickle-themed gift shop. She's a spokesperson for the Mt. Olive Pickle Company. There are pickle hats, T-shirts, rows of pickle jars and, in the back, resting on a wide shelf...\nWow. OK.\nIt is the big, green plastic pickle the town lowers into a jar every New Year's Eve.\nWILLIAMS: It's about 3 1/2 feet. It's maybe 6 or 8 pounds. It is a sweet petite.\nDE LA CANAL: Now, this pickle is being retired because the company is commissioning a new bigger one for its 100th anniversary this year. And if you're wondering why a town would drop a pickle on New Year's Eve, the answer is baked - or maybe brined - into Mount Olive's history.\nWILLIAMS: In the early 1900s, this was a small little village, a commercial center for a big agricultural area.\nDE LA CANAL: Farmers could grow lots of cucumbers, but there wasn't much demand.\nWILLIAMS: So the businesspeople thought, if you could create a new market for farmers, the whole town would benefit.\nDE LA CANAL: Thus, the Mt. Olive Pickle Company was born in 1926. It grew into one of the town's largest employers and a major source of local pride. In 1999, company executives thought it'd be funny to drop a pickle on New Year's Eve as a marketing stunt. But to locals, it quickly became a really big dill (ph).\nWILLIAMS: And we thought, what a hoot. All these people had the same amount of weird sense of humor that we did, and from then, it's just grown.\nDE LA CANAL: Across the country, many towns and cities drop objects on New Year's Eve tied to local identity. They include a potato in Boise, Idaho, a cheese wedge in Plymouth, Wisconsin, a moon pie in Mobile, Alabama, even a drag queen in a shoe in Key West.\nAMY GROSSMANN: They often reflect regional economies. They point to local labor histories, but they also can celebrate what helped a community survive or thrive.\nDE LA CANAL: Amy Grossmann is with the North Carolina Folklife Society. She says, just look at the orange drop in Miami, representing the state's citrus industry. And then there are seafood drops, like a shrimp in coastal Georgia and a lobster drop in Maine.\nGROSSMANN: They can be a way of saying to people, this is what made us.\nDE LA CANAL: Some drops have even stirred controversy, like in Brasstown, North Carolina, where residents dropped a live possum until pushback from animal rights activists ended the practice in 2019. Tallapoosa, Georgia, still drops a stuffed possum each year. Back in the Mt. Olive Pickle Parlor, shopper Stephen Edwards says he's excited for this year's centennial drop.\nSTEPHEN EDWARDS: If there's one thing that defines this town, it's definitely pickles.\nDE LA CANAL: Beside him, his 9-year-old niece, Ella Edwards, has her own ideas for the centennial pickle.\nELLA EDWARDS: Maybe they cut it open, and there's pickles inside.\nDE LA CANAL: Oh, like a pickle pinata.\nELLA: Yeah.\nDE LA CANAL: For the Mount Olive Chamber of Commerce, this year's drop is a can't-miss event, says its president, Julie Beck.\nJULIE BECK: If you come out that night, you'll have a dill-lightful (ph) time, and you'll try some dill-icious (ph) food, and it's a big dill.\nDE LA CANAL: And she hopes the pickle will usher in a new year that's more sweet than sour.\nFor NPR News, I'm Nick de la Canal in Mount Olive, North Carolina.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nCopyright © 2025 NPR.

The city's solution appears successful two years later, but funding for it is set to run out.\nSCOTT DETROW, HOST:\nIn 2023, Phoenix faced a court order to disperse a massive homeless encampment. Part of the city's response was to create a campground downtown for people experiencing homelessness. It's running smoothly, but the future of the site is uncertain as funding begins to dry up. From member station KJZZ, Katherine Davis-Young reports.\nKATHERINE DAVIS-YOUNG, BYLINE: Earlier this year, Michael Travis was living in a Phoenix apartment when his rent increased almost 30%. Pretty soon, he faced the extremely stressful experience of living on the street.\nMICHAEL TRAVIS: It's a different day every day. There's a lot of things that's going on. You got drugs going on out there. You got people dying outside.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: He tried going to a homeless shelter, but he didn't feel much safer inside the crowded, chaotic facility. Then he got a referral to Phoenix's Safe Outdoor Space. It's a four-acre lot downtown with a huge shade structure covering about 200 tents pitched on AstroTurf. Travis has his own tent. He has his dog with him, and he says this is better than being on the street or in a shelter.\nTRAVIS: These security are more thorough in what they do, and the staff as well.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: The site has all the services that indoor shelters have, says Phoenix's Homeless Office director Rachel Milne.\nRACHEL MILNE: So back here, we've got all of our restrooms, hand-washing stations, showers, laundry.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: And even though guests sleep in tents, there's a warehouse in the middle where they can eat meals or escape the elements.\nMILNE: This is what made this site so attractive to us. In addition to all of the shade out there, having a place where people could come inside in the summer or the winter or a monsoon.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: Before this opened in 2023, a downtown homeless encampment had grown so large that neighbors sued and a judge ordered the city to clear the area. Officials wanted to offer shelter to all of the nearly 1,000 people camped there. But Milne says...\nMILNE: We knew pretty quickly that not everyone was going to accept our offer of indoor sites.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: So the city bought this industrial lot nearby to create another alternative. It wasn't the first of its kind. A 2023 study in the journal Urban Geography showed dozens of sites like this across the U.S. took off during the pandemic as homelessness increased, but tight quarters and shelters posed a health risk. But they're often controversial. In Phoenix, neighbors voiced concern that downtown was already burdened with most of the city's homeless services, and some asked why Phoenix would spend millions to house people in tents rather than building more shelters.\nBILL MORLAN: One of my stipulations was that I really thought it needed to be a temporary solution.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: Bill Morlan owns an electric supply business in the neighborhood. He asked city council to only approve the site for three years, allowing time to respond to the homelessness lawsuit but committing to an end date. The council agreed to that three-year limit. Two years in, homelessness continues to increase, and Morlan's feelings have changed. He says the campground hasn't been disruptive and it's still needed.\nMORLAN: I would hope to see them continue to fund it at the levels that it's being funded and continue it.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: Funding could be a challenge. The city has spent more than 6 million a year to operate the site, all of which has come from pandemic-era federal aid so far. Those funds expire in 2026, and Milne says it will be up to the city council to decide what happens to this site after its third year.\nMILNE: Might not look exactly like this a year from now or two years from now.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: But more than 2,000 people have now come through the Safe Outdoor Space. About a third have gone on to treatment, indoor shelter or housing. That's a better success rate than some other shelters, Milne says. While the future of the campground is uncertain, she says the last two years prove it can work.

The Trump administration calls this one of its latest America First policies. Rachel Cohen, from the Mountain West News Bureau, reports from a town that was built around park visitors.\nRACHEL COHEN, BYLINE: Gary Hall, the mayor of Estes Park, Colorado, says there's a lot to see and do here.\nGARY HALL: There's a really old 5 and 10 cent-type shop. And that has everything.\nCOHEN: There's the iconic Stanley Hotel and a 90-year-old saltwater taffy shop. But the main attraction is Rocky Mountain National Park. Starting January 1, non-U.S. residents visiting the park will have to pay more than the current $35 per vehicle for a week-long pass, an additional $100 per person. That also applies at parks including Yosemite, the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum explained the change in a social media video.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nDOUG BURGUM: Ensures they contribute their fair share to help preserve and maintain these treasured places.\nCOHEN: Around 14 million international visitors toured national parks in 2018, according to the U.S. Travel Association. In prior years, the U.K., China and Germany were their top home countries. Hall worries the higher fees send them the wrong message.\nHALL: We don't really like you, but if you want to come, you can pay a whole bunch of extra money. I mean, that's what it feels like.\nCOHEN: Mckenzie McMillan thinks the surcharge could backfire. He's with a travel agency called The Travel Group based in Vancouver, Canada.\nMCKENZIE MCMILLAN: International travelers, they're spending significant more money per day in destination than domestic travelers are. So it's perplexing that they would put up a barrier to international visitors.\nCOHEN: But McMillan says the higher park fees aren't top of mind for many of his clients, partly because interest in traveling to the U.S. has already dropped sharply starting, he says, after President Trump's talk of making Canada the 51st state. But Tate Watkins says the fees could help parks. He works for the Property and Environment Research Center, which describes itself as a free-market conservation nonprofit. Watkins says the added revenue could chip away at the billions of dollars in park maintenance backlogs.\nTATE WATKINS: It means that parks have more resources to help serve those people, serve them better and essentially cope with the additional strains that more people inevitably bring.\nCOHEN: A key study Watkins did on Yellowstone earlier this year found that raising fees could bring in $55 million a year and projected they would only decrease visitation by just over 1%. That rings true for Thomas Pemberton, owner of Estes Park Tour Guides. About 1 in 5 of his customers comes from overseas. He says the surcharge could make the park a less appealing day trip, but he doesn't expect a major hit to his business.\nTHOMAS PEMBERTON: If you can afford a vacation in the States for three weeks, this is a minor, little blip.\nCOHEN: But he's unsure how the new policy will work in practice and how it will be enforced.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MACHINE CLANGING)\nCOHEN: Taffy shop owner Mark Igel packs up holiday orders of pink cinnamon, green peppermint and red-and-white candy cane taffy. He sees the new international fees as just one more hurdle.\nMARK IGEL: Scheduling a visit to the park, timed entry, construction in Estes Park that every visitor has to deal with in order to come in and spend $20 on a box of taffy.\nCOHEN: Igel doesn't expect a dramatic impact. But he says he'll be watching to see how these America first fees play out on main streets like this.\nFor NPR News, I'm Rachel Cohen.\n(SOUNDBITE OF KACEY MUSGRAVES SONG, \"SLOW BURN\")\nCopyright © 2025 NPR.

As Rebecca Smith with member station KBIA in Columbia, Missouri, reports, these changes are having a disproportionate effect on one already vulnerable group, LGBTQ people.\nREBECCA SMITH, BYLINE: Emilia Stauffer walks towards the back of the GLO Center in Springfield, Missouri, carrying a heavy box of canned vegetables to a small closet that's packed to the brim with boxes of shelf-stable foods, hygiene products and more.\nEMILIA STAUFFER: So this is where everything gets stored.\nSMITH: Stauffer is the community services specialist for the GLO Center, which supports the LGBTQ+ community throughout Southeast Missouri. In early 2025, the center recognized the rising need in their community for help accessing resources such as housing, health care and food.\nSTAUFFER: We have a population that is underemployed, underinsured, either not able or scared to access services.\nSMITH: In a 2025 report, the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, which studies LGBTQ+ law and policy, reported that 2.1 million LGBTQ+ adults were enrolled in SNAP nationwide. But now, following the passage of Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill, which puts limits on the food assistance program, it could be harder for them to receive and retain benefits. Stauffer says for her clients, that's not a new challenge. Many don't seek out help due to fear of discrimination or the risk of violence.\nSTAUFFER: They're literally terrified. I know we're here to talk about food, but just even the idea of being flagged as trans is terrifying.\nSMITH: People often have to present identification at food banks and pantries, which could inadvertently out transgender and gender-nonconforming people whose identities may not match the gender on their IDs. Plus many food pantries are tied to religious groups. One 2022 analysis, published in the BMC Public Health journal, found that more than 60% of U.S. food pantries were affiliated with faith-based groups.\nSTAUFFER: Not all faith organizations are the same, but when one has experienced religious trauma, it's easier to overgeneralize than to make that risk.\nSMITH: Because of this, Stauffer meets with groups in the area to determine if they would be safe and welcoming for her clients, but she says it can still be hard for people to go into spaces that historically have been unwelcoming. Brad Sears agrees. He's one of the founders of the Williams Institute and studies food insecurity in the LGBTQ+ community. He says there's many reasons beyond just fear of discrimination that LGBTQ+ people are food insecure and less likely to use SNAP than their straight or cisgender peers, such as higher rates of poverty and less of a support system.\nBRAD SEARS: And, you know, the vast majority of people overall and in the LGBT community who rely on SNAP are either disabled, or they're raising young children.\n(CROSSTALK)\nSMITH: Since March 2025, the GLO Center in Springfield has worked with at least 250 individuals and families. As Missouri implements SNAP changes, which reduces benefits for some and makes others ineligible altogether, the center has already seen a fourfold increase in need. Here's executive director Aaron Kitchens.\nAARON KITCHENS: The queer community is - we're known for our resilience. And so we want to take action not just 'cause it's the right thing to do, but also because these are our friends and family. Like, this is our community.\nSMITH: Kitchens says the center will continue to find ways to provide direct care to the LGBTQ+ community in the region. All folks have to do is call or drop by.

It was important to us to experience these markets because we really enjoy Christmas festivities, and the mix of culture and history is hard to find anywhere else.\nWe walked about 10 miles a day in a packed schedule through a couple dozen Christmas markets in Hungary, Germany and Austria. No two were quite alike.\nThe market at Vienna's 18th century Schönbrunn Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was among the most special. When I first saw this huge lit-up star archway with its message of welcome, I gasped. The market, in the palace's grand courtyard, was full of attractions including an ice rink, ice stock games (like curling), a Ferris wheel, carousel and tons of food and craft booths.\nWe made a point to try local specialties like Käsespätzle (a German macaroni and cheese) and Glühwein, or mulled wine. Most Christmas markets across Europe serve Glühwein in collectible mugs with the market's logo or shaped like Santa's boot. You can pay a deposit and return the mug or keep it as a memento.\nWhat I loved most was the sense of community at these markets. They can get crowded, but everyone's there to enjoy the food, wine and fun. You often end up chatting with strangers or hearing about another stall to check out.\nAt the Altwiener Christkindl Market, also in Vienna, we talked with an artisan about a New Year's tradition, Schwein gehabt, which means \"had a pig\" and symbolizes prosperity. In Germany and Austria, owning a pig meant wealth. Around New Year's, people gift pig-shaped charms as tokens of good fortune.

But Israel is now barring those groups from bringing aid or international staff to the Palestinian enclave. NPR's Aya Batrawy reports.\nAYA BATRAWY, BYLINE: Under new Israeli rules, at least 37 aid organizations will no longer be able to operate as they have been for decades in Gaza. These include widely recognized aid groups like Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, which operates hospital wards, clinics and mental health programs in Gaza. Israel now demands these organizations provide a detailed list of their staff and funding information. But MSF, who've had 15 of their Palestinian staff killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza in the war, are concerned their staff could be targeted as a result.\nPASCAL QUASAR: We have expressed our concerns to the Israeli authorities about sharing the staff list because it is unclear, still, for us, what they are going to use it for.\nBATRAWY: That's MSF emergency coordinator Pascal Quasar. She says they and other aid groups have held discussions with Israeli officials for months now about what this personal data will be used for, but they've received no clear answers.\nPASCAL QUASAR: The use of the personal data information for now is still unclear and it has lacked transparency.\nBATRAWY: The U.N. says around 400 aid workers were killed in Israeli attacks in the war. Many of them were targeted directly while working. Israel has accused some of being agents of Hamas and says its new long list of requirements is designed to prevent the infiltration of, quote, \"terrorist operatives\" in humanitarian aid distribution. But many aid groups didn't comply and Israel canceled the permits of dozens. The list of banned groups now includes Oxfam, which works on desalination and clean water, The Norwegian Refugee Council, which oversees tents and shelter supplies, Mercy Corps, which distributes food and basic aid, and many others. These aid groups also have provided detailed, critical accounts of what is happening in Gaza at a time when Israel is still barring international press from independent access.\n(SOUNDBITE OF WIND BLOWING)\nBATRAWY: It's winter now in Gaza, and people's makeshift tents are flooding with rain. Children have died in the cold. Israel, which had already been blocking many of these groups from bringing in aid says this decision will have no major impact. But Gaza relies on aid for survival, and a joint statement by 10 countries like the U.K., France and Canada, says this will shut down a third of healthcare facilities in Gaza, calling it unacceptable.\nAya Batrawy, NPR News, Dubai.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nCopyright © 2025 NPR.

Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.\nToday's top stories\nThe flu season is off to a rough start this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that at least 7.5 million people have been sickened, and more than 3,100 people have died from the flu this season. The surge in cases appears to be driven primarily by a new strain of the virus known as subclade K of influenza A(H3N2), which emerged over the summer in Australia.\n- 🎧 The new strain doesn't seem to be more severe or dangerous than previous ones, NPR's Gabrielle Emanuel tells Up First. Instead, this year's flu vaccine appears to be mismatched against the virus because it was formulated before the strain emerged. Early data from the U.K. show that the vaccine remains effective at preventing hospitalization. Some health experts, however, have raised concerns that the federal government has failed to launch a strong flu vaccination campaign.\nPresident Trump's critics say that a strike on a Venezuelan facility is dragging the U.S. even closer to a more dangerous conflict. This week, the president revealed new details about an attack against a Venezuelan dock allegedly used to load drugs onto boats. The latest operation marks the first known U.S. strike inside Venezuela — an escalation of Trump's campaign against Nicolás Maduro's government.\n- 🎧 The strike is significant because it raises the risk of killing people who have nothing to do with narcotics trafficking, NPR's Franco Ordoñez says. Up until this strike, the U.S. was targeting some sanctioned oil tankers and boats suspected of trafficking drugs. Both of those operations have taken place in international waters.\nIran is experiencing its largest protests in years as thousands of people, unhappy with the state of the economy, flood the streets. Inflation in the country has skyrocketed, and the currency has plummeted to a record low. Public anger is growing over sanctions against the ruling government.\n- 🎧 Months of anger and frustration over water and energy shortages, civil rights abuses and widespread corruption have fueled the current unrest, NPR's Jackie Northam says. These criticisms, combined with the economic protests, have the potential to spiral into something significantly larger. The 12-day war Iran had with Israel over the summer was costly. There is now a widespread belief that Israel will start another conflict with the country, which would add more economic uncertainty, Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, tells Northam.\nLiving better\nLiving Better is a special series about what it takes to stay healthy in America.\nDecember is the busiest time of year for package deliveries and for the porch pirates who steal them.

It's a throwback to the anti-religious Soviet era, when Christmas was canceled and replaced by New Year's.\n\"It's still, for many, the big holiday,\" says food writer Polina Chesnakova, who moved to the U.S. when the Soviet Union collapsed and grew up in a community of Soviet refugees.\nClassic dishes include shuba, known as herring under a fur coat, and Olivier salad, a Russian potato salad. Both star mayonnaise, the industrial condiment that disguised the sparse, bland ingredients available in the Soviet era.\nToday, though, many Ukrainians are stepping away from the Soviet shadow and all that mayonnaise — and emphasizing Christmas over New Year's, by rediscovering traditional holiday dishes.\n\"A lot of Ukrainian chefs discover our old culture and we try [to] renew our rich culture,\" says Mykola Yudin, head chef at Ruta, a Ukrainian restaurant in Washington, D.C.\nA centerpiece of the Ukrainian Christmas table is kutia, a sweet, warm porridge of pearled barley mixed with berries, nuts and stewed dried fruit.\nMixed into the kutia porridge is uzvar, a punch of boiled dried fruits. It's also a drink you serve separately with the meal.\n\"It's an old recipe of my grandmother,\" Yudin says.\nYudin, 36, grew up in Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine. When pro-Russian separatists captured the region in 2014, he moved to the capital Kyiv, where he worked in restaurants. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, he fled again, to the U.S.\nThis year he represented Ukraine at a culinary competition of embassies in the U.S. His black currant liqueur won the award for best beverage.\nHe has read books about Ukrainian cuisine from hundreds of years ago, and was amazed to discover natural ingredients Ukrainians used before the Soviet era — from almond flour to vanilla.\nHe and restaurant manager Anastasiia Briukh, who also fled Ukraine when war broke out in 2022, sent their families back home in Ukraine money to buy power banks — because Russian attacks this Christmas season have knocked out electricity.\nUkraine's president has been holding talks with President Trump on a peace proposal — including a proposed compromise on territory in eastern Ukraine where Yudin, the chef, is from.\n\"Ukrainians are always open for compromises,\" Yudin says, through an interpreter. \"We value our culture and our territory a lot, but the most important part is our people.\"\nAs a new year nears, they are far away from their families in Ukraine, but they celebrate food that tastes like home.\nAnton Loboda assisted with interpretation for this piece.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2025/12/31/nx-s1-5660765/ukrainian-food-holidays", "published_at": "2025-12-31T07:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

She went on to lead his party, known as the BNP, and in 1990, brought it to victory and became the country's first female prime minister. Over the next few decades, she veered between power and prison as she wrestled with her rival, the other woman who dominated Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina.\nMany mourners shared a clip of the speech she gave to address rumors that she would live in exile.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nKHALEDA ZIA: (Non-English language spoken).\nHADID: She says, \"I have nowhere else to live, save for this country. This is where I belong.\" Khaleda Zia was admired for her defiance. Critics say that ultimately papered over her faults, too. She made alliances with hardliners. She jailed her own opponents. And she, too, spent the last few years of her life between prison and house arrest on charges of corruption that she said were politically motivated.\nHer freedom finally came the day after her rival, Sheikh Hasina, was ousted and exiled in August 2024 amid mass protests.

The country's currency is plummeting amid concerns Israel will restart its war with Iran, a move President Trump signaled he would approve.\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\nIran is seeing its biggest protest in years. Thousands of people have taken to the streets in several cities across the country to protest the economy.\nA MARTÍNEZ, HOST:\nInflation in Iran has skyrocketed, and the country's currency has plummeted to a record low. Anger is growing over sanctions on the country's ruling government, and businesses have closed as many students have joined the demonstrations.\nMARTIN: NPR's international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam has been following these developments, and she's with us now to tell us more about it. Good morning, Jackie.\nJACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.\nMARTIN: So first, could you just describe these protests and what prompted them?\nNORTHAM: What started this round of protests was, as you say, the economy, which is in very bad shape. You know, Iran has struggled under sanctions for more than a decade. And because of that, its oil exports, which are the lifeblood of the country's economy, are sharply curtailed. And so, too, is investment. The local currency, the rial, has plummeted. Inflation is running over 40%. And the government recently published a draft of the budget, which predicted that the real incomes of the salaried middle class will fall by about half. So on top of everything else, that seemed to ignite these protests.\nMARTIN: How is the regime reacting to these protests so far?\nNORTHAM: We're starting to see the security forces crack down. You know, there are videos on social media showing them firing tear gas into the crowd. Also, the authorities today announced a shutdown of government offices, banks, schools, universities across more than 20 provinces, and they said it was due to cold weather. They didn't mention the protests. The country's moderate president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is urging the regime to listen to what he called the legitimate demands of the protesters. As far as the economy, the head of the central bank resigned, and the bank started throwing U.S. dollars into the market to help prop up the rial, which helped a bit, but, you know, it doesn't have unlimited resources to do that.\nI spoke with Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, and he's an economics professor at Virginia Tech specializing in the Iranian economy. And he said another thing is that the 12-day war with Israel this past summer was expensive, and there's a widespread belief now that Israel will start another war, which is smothering investment.\nDJAVAD SALEHI-ISFAHANI: That introduces a kind of uncertainty into an economy that's already very uncertain because of sanctions, because of government policies. So you have kind of a perfect storm now reaching over Iran's economy.\nNORTHAM: The threat of another war grew larger when President Trump said on Monday that the U.S. would back an Israeli attack if Iran appeared to be building up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.\nMARTIN: And given what's going on in Iran right now, is there a sense that this could threaten the regime?\nNORTHAM: The protests haven't reached that point yet, Michel. You know, there was a serious challenge to the regime in 2022 during an uprising after an Iranian woman died in police custody after being arrested for not wearing a headscarf. And those protests lasted for over a month, and more than 500 people were killed, 20,000 people were arrested. You know, we are a long way from that. But there's been anger and frustration for months in Iran over severe water and energy shortages, civil rights abuses and widespread corruption. You add all this on to the protests about the economy, and, you know, there are serious concerns that this could spiral into something much larger.\nMARTIN: And before we let you go, President Trump said on Monday that the U.S. would back an Israeli attack if Iran appeared to be building up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. How has Iran reacted to that?\nNORTHAM: Well, they said they would come down hard. They said that they would retaliate in kind to anything that the U.S. can throw at Iran. You know, at the end of the day, the hope is that there can be some negotiations, but neither side are in the position to start those.\nMARTIN: That is NPR international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam. Jackie, thank you.\nNORTHAM: Thank you.\nCopyright © 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

To look more closely at what's driving the protests in Iran, we turn to Hooman Majd. He's an Iranian American author and also an NBC contributor. So you're in touch with people in Iran. What have they told you about life under this economy?\nHOOMAN MAJD: Oh, it's horrible. I mean, you know, the best way to describe the past year, at least, is what, you know, the - Queen Elizabeth once called England's annus horribilis, a terrible, terrible year, for Iran. What started out relatively optimistically with Trump taking office and starting negotiations with Iran turned into war in June, which caused a huge depreciation of Iran's currency and uncertainty about the market. And, you know, most imports in Iran are based on the dollar. And when you lose 40% of your purchasing power, it becomes very difficult to maintain a lifestyle that you're accustomed to. I mean, people in Iran are really unhappy more about the economy than anything else.\nSocial freedoms have been relaxed quite a bit since the Women, Life, Freedom protests that were mentioned earlier in 2022. Women now regularly go out without hijab. This is not something that is being - causing concern for people.\nMARTÍNEZ: Yeah.\nMAJD: Political freedoms are not really what people are concerned about. It's really the cost of living.\nMARTÍNEZ: That James Carville line, right? It's the economy, stupid.\nMAJD: It's the economy, stupid. I mean...\nMARTÍNEZ: Yeah.\nMAJD: A quick example is people - a regular person in Iran, doing a regular job - I can't really describe what that would be, whether it's a government official or someone - a barista in a high-end coffee shop, for example, in Tehran, is making less than $100 a month.\nMARTÍNEZ: Wow.\nMAJD: And Iran is not a country - at today's exchange rate. And Iran is not a country where the prices of goods are very, very low, like, you know, a desperate third-world country, for example.\nMARTÍNEZ: So - but wait. So who do they blame then? I mean, who do the people in Iran blame? The government, sanctions? Who are they blaming?\nMAJD: Well, they definitely will always blame the government, and they'll blame the government for mismanagement and corruption. They'll also blame sanctions. But when you blame sanctions, you can also blame your own government. Why did you not make a deal? Or why did you make a deal that Trump was able to tear up, as Trump said in 2018? I mean, everything went downhill from 2018 economically with the reimposition of sanctions. When the JCPOA, the original nuclear deal under Obama, was signed, there was great optimism in Iran. There was - you know, people were very happy about it. They were happy with their government.\nWhen Trump came to power and came to office and tore up that deal, everything started going downhill. And what happened in January of this year is when Trump took office and said he was going to make a deal, there was optimism. And the rial actually initially went probably, I'd say, 50% higher than it had been because of that optimism. And as we know, Steve Witkoff, Trump's Mideast envoy, was having talks with Iran, with Iranian foreign minister regularly. And in the middle of those talks, Israel attacked.\nMARTÍNEZ: Yeah.\nMAJD: So they're blaming - I mean, the people blame everything,\nMARTÍNEZ: Yeah, everything.\nMAJD: And they just want a solution - and they want a solution. But, you know, as the report earlier said, this is not yet an Iranian Spring. It's not the Arab Spring. It's not 100,000 people in Tahrir Square.\nMARTÍNEZ: So we're not quite there yet. You mentioned Trump, though, and I'm wondering, Hooman, when it comes to President Trump, he's supporting the protesters, but he has not called for regime change. So how much would you say that he factors into what people in Iran are feeling?\nMAJD: Well, I think he definitely factors in because - I mean, he's factored in ever since he's been in office - I think, you know, his support of Israel, his bombing of Iran and what he said just this week with - in the press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that he would support Israel attacking Iran, not just on the nuclear issue, but on the ballistic missiles. And now, that's a big issue for Iran because the ballistic missiles that Iran has, the missiles it was able to use, in the war with Israel is really its only line of defense for the country. So if you're a nationalist Iranian, if you're someone who is proud of your country, regardless of the government, you're going to be very upset about that, and you're going to consider this...\nMARTÍNEZ: Yeah.\nMAJD: ...Very threatening and potentially destabilizing Iran even more. So people are very worried right now. I mean, everybody I talk to is extremely worried about the future.\nMARTÍNEZ: Hooman Majd, an Iranian American author and NBC contributor. Thank you very much for sharing your thoughts on this.\nMAJD: My pleasure. Thank you.\nCopyright © 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.
