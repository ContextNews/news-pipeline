Heat ½ tbsp oil in a saucepan and cook 1 finely sliced small onion until soft.\nAdd 1 finely chopped garlic clove, 1 finely chopped red chilli and ¼ tsp smoked paprika, and cook for 2 minutes.\nTip in 450g chopped fresh tomatoes, 75ml red-wine vinegar and 50g soft light-brown sugar, and bring to the boil.\nTurn the heat down and simmer for about 20 minutes. The mixture should be thick and a little jammy. Season and taste – you might want to adjust the sweet-sour balance by adding some more vinegar or more sugar. Leave to cool.\nPreheat the oven to 160C/150C fan/gas mark 3.\nPut 350g spinach in a saucepan and add 2 tbsp water. Cover and set over a low to medium heat, turning the spinach a couple of times as it cooks. Within 4-5 minutes it will have wilted to softness.\nDrain. Once it’s cool enough to handle, press out the excess water, then chop roughly.\nMelt about 10g of the butter in a frying pan and sauté the spinach. Season. It should be buttery but not wet. Leave to cool.\nMake four sandwiches using the 8 slices of white bread and some of the butter (the rest is for frying the sandwiches in). On each base piece of bread divide half the sliced gruyère or comté, then the spinach and then the other half of the cheese. Put the second piece of buttered bread on top. Cut each sandwich in half.\nBeat the 7 large eggs with 3 tbsp milk in a broad, shallow dish (you may find it easier to use two dishes). Season.\nDip the sandwiches in the egg mixture, leave them to soak for a little while, then turn them over. You want to soak them until they have absorbed a lot of the egg, but not so long that they have become soft and are beginning to fall apart.\nHeat the rest of the butter with about 1 tbsp oil across two large frying pans.\nOver a medium heat, fry the sandwiches, flipping them over every so often, until you can see the egg batter has cooked and the cheese has melted. You need to press down with a spatula on the sandwiches so that the cheese inside gets close to the heat of the base of the pan. The sandwiches should turn lovely and golden.\nTransfer them to a dish lined with kitchen paper and keep them warm in a low oven while you fry 8-12 rashers streaky bacon in the same pan.\nServe the French toast with crispy bacon on top and a dollop of the tomato relish.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/everyday/breakfast/gruyere-spinach-french-toast-bacon-tomato-relish-recipe/", "published_at": "2025-12-31T13:52:35+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

There was no conviction, no energy, no quality, just a familiar listlessness that was painful to watch.\nFor Wolves, who possessed the game’s best player in the dynamic, youthful figure of Mateus Mane, this was one of their brightest showings in a torrid season.\nThey are still without a win at the halfway stage but this result ended a run of 11 successive Premier League defeats and will offer manager Rob Edwards some crumbs of comfort heading into the new year.\nThey ran further than United, had more touches in their opponent’s penalty area than the home side and a higher xG. But for the United goalkeeper Senne Lammens, comfortably his team’s stand-out performer, they might even have taken the three points.\nAmorim veered between the agitated and the angry on the touchline throughout the game and had to listen to fans booing not just the half-time and full-time whistles but also his own substitutions.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2025/12/30/man-utd-vs-wolves-live-score-latest-lineups-premier-league/", "published_at": "2025-12-31T12:19:20+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}
