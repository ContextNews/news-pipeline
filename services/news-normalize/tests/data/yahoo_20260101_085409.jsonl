The Interior Department said it was terminating the lease because the nonprofit had not implemented required capital improvements and failed to meet the terms of the lease.\nWhile it was unclear what the Trump administration's plans are for the golf courses, the move gives Trump, whose private company has developed numerous golf courses in the U.S. and abroad, the chance to remake links overlooking the Potomac River and in Rock Creek Park and a site that is part of Black golf history.\nOfficials for the National Links Trust said in a statement that they were “devastated” by the decision to terminate the lease and defended their management of the courses. They said $8.5 million had gone toward capital improvements at the courses and that rounds played and revenue had more than doubled in their tenure managing the courses. The nonprofit has agreed to keep managing the courses for the time being, but long-term renovations will stop.\n“While this termination is a major setback, we remain stubbornly hopeful that a path forward can be found that preserves affordable and accessible public golf in the nation’s capital for generations to come,” the officials added.\nThe Department of the Interior's decision comes as Trump rebrands civic spaces in Washington and deploys National Guard members to the streets for public safety. The Kennedy Center added Trump's name this month after the center's board of trustees — made up of Trump appointees — voted to change the name of the performing arts space designated by Congress as a memorial to John F.

It was eight degrees on the 29th and eight degrees or six degrees for a record low in 1968 on this day (Dec. 30).

If true, this would be the first video of its kind.\nThe team captured this footage by rigging a deep-sea camera to a polar tourism vessel.\nHumans spend nearly their entire lives on land, but the Earth we call home is really a water world. With 71 percent of the Earth’s surface covered by water, this expansive ecosystem has been difficult to study, and many animals of the deep ocean remain a complete mystery. One of the most spellbinding of these animals is the colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni). When full-grown, this creature is about as long as a bus and weighs nearly 1,100 pounds.\nBelieved to live in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, this immense cephalopod—the largest invertebrate species on the planet— has never been observed in its natural habitat. Scientists only get a good look at these animals when trawlers accidentally catch them in their nets. But a new kind of oceanographic study seems to have struck gold last year when international research team and non-profit called Kolossal appeared to have stumbled across a juvenile colossal squid during one of its four trips to Antarctica from December 2022 to March 2023.\nThe team used a novel approach for imaging the ocean—outfitting a polar tourism vessel called the Ocean Endeavor with a deep-sea camera. Thankfully, the research team released the footage, which the website IFLScience promptly posted to YouTube.\n“Antarctica is experiencing rapid and complex change, and it is critical to have a better understanding of these changes for the region’s ocean ecosystems,” the Kolossal team wrote in a paper detailing the method in 2024. “The costs and logistical challenges to operate scientific research vessels prohibits the scaling of crucial science and discovery in the region. Yet, the tourism industry in Antarctica is growing rapidly, and collaboration between tourism companies and researchers provides important access to the region.”\nWhile leveraging tourism for marine exploration is a logistical win-win, finding verified footage of a colossal squid is as hard as ever. Even the short clip of the above specimen isn’t confirmed, as the video could be capturing an adult glass squid Galiteuthis glacialis or perhaps even a species completely unknown to science. The video is being peer-reviewed by experts, but it’s unlikely that scientists will ever know for sure. But because footage of any squid species in the Southern Ocean is rare, the footage is a huge victory for marine biologists studying these famously elusive animals regardless of its contents.\n“The two known Cranchiidae taxa seen in the Antarctic are Galiteuthis glacialis and Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni,” Aaron Evans, who is peer reviewing the footage, told IFLScience. “The squid seen here could belong to different life stages of either of those taxa—and is an exciting example of wild cranchiid behavior, as I cannot think of existing video footage of either of those squid in their natural environment.”\nAlthough the team’s stated goal is to capture footage of an adult colossal squid in its natural environment, according to IFLScience, the camera filmed nearly 80 species. Among them were giant volcano sponges, Antarctic sunflower stars, and many other marine invertebrates.\nFor now, the world’s largest invertebrate species frustratingly remains one of the animal kingdom’s largest mysteries. But as marine biologists team up with tourism vessels to explore the oceans, some of the our water planet’s biggest questions could slowly be answered.\nYou Might Also Like", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/first-time-ever-colossal-squid-140800659.html", "published_at": "2025-12-31T14:08:00+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush — a role that is akin to being the general manager of the residence.\n“All the presidents that I had an opportunity to serve always talked about some possibility of an enlarged area” for entertaining, Walters said in an interview with The Associated Press about his recently published memoir.\nTrump has been talking about building a White House ballroom for years, even before he entered the political arena. In July, the White House announced a 90,000-square-foot space would be built on the east side of the complex to accommodate 650 seated guests at a then-estimated cost of $200 million. Trump has said it will be paid for with private donations, including from him.\nThe Republican president later upped the proposed ballroom’s capacity to 999 people and, by October, had demolished the two-story East Wing of the White House to build it there. In December, he updated the price tag to $400 million — double the original estimate.\nImages of the East Wing being demolished shocked historians, preservationists and others, but Walters said there is a long history of projects on the campus, ranging from conservatories, greenhouses and stables being torn down to build the West Wing in 1902, to the expansion of the residence with a third floor, to the addition of the East Wing itself during World War II to provide workspace for the first lady, her staff and other White House offices.\n“So there's always been construction going on around the White House,” Walters said.\nOther presidents bemoaned the lack of space for entertaining\nWhen Walters was on the job, the capacity of the largest public rooms in the White House was among the first topics he discussed with the incoming president, first lady and their social secretary, he said. The presidents he served all talked about the limited number of people the White House could handle.\nWhen set up for a state dinner, the State Dining Room can hold about 130 people: 13 round tables each with seating for 10, Walters said. The East Room can accommodate about 300 chairs — fewer if space is needed for television cameras.\nTrump complains often that both rooms are too small. He also has complained about the use of large tents on the south grounds, the main workaround for big events such as ritzy state dinners for foreign leaders. Walters said the tents had issues.\n“When it rained, the water flows downhill and the grass became soggy, no matter what we tried to do,” Walters said. “We dug culverts around the outside of the tent to try and get the water.\" Tents damaged the grass, requiring more work to reseed it, he said.\nMore in Politics\nTrump, 79, Falls for Karoline Leavitt ‘Rate My Butt’ Account\nWalters admitted it was a bit jarring to see the East Wing torn down, and said he had fond personal memories of the space. “I met my wife at the White House and she worked in the East Wing, so that was a joy for me,” said Walters, 79.\nHis wife, Barbara, was a receptionist in the visitors office during the administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. The couple recently celebrated 48 years of marriage.\nBroken bones alter usher's career trajectory\nWalters owes his place in history as the longest-serving White House chief usher to the misfortune of a broken ankle.\nHe was 23 in early 1970, honorably discharged from the Army and looking for a job that would allow him to finish college at night. The Executive Protective Service, a precursor to the U.S. Secret Service, was hiring and accepted him.\nBut shortly before the graduation ceremony, Walters broke an ankle playing football. He could not patrol out of uniform, wearing a cast and hobbling around on crutches, so he was given a temporary assignment in the White House Police Control and Appointments Center. He stayed for five years.\n“This injury also changed the course of my career,” Walters wrote in his memoir, “White House Memories: 1970-2007: Recollections of the Longest-Serving Chief Usher.” He gained an ”in-depth knowledge of the ways and security systems of the White House that would ultimately greatly benefit me in my future role in the Usher's Office.\"\nA few months after being promoted to sergeant in 1975, he learned of an opening in the Usher's Office. He applied and joined as an assistant in early 1976.\nA decade later, he was elevated to chief usher by Reagan, who gave Walters the top job in the residence overseeing maintenance, construction and renovation projects, and food service, along with administrative, financial and personnel functions. He managed a staff of about 90 butlers, housekeepers, cooks, florists, electricians, engineers, plumbers and others.\nWalters retired in 2007 after 37 years at the White House, including a record 21 years as chief usher. He served under seven presidents, from Nixon to George W.

Barmore is facing a domestic assault and battery charge after his girlfriend told police he threw her to the ground in August at his home outside Boston.\nA criminal complaint issued Dec. 18 claims Barmore, 26, briefly took the woman's phone, threw her to the ground and grabbed her by the shirt inside the home in Mansfield, Massachusetts.\nMansfield Police Sgt. John Armstrong said the woman called police on Aug. 25 to report what had occurred almost three weeks earlier. The woman told police she had stayed at the home periodically during their relationship of several years.\nBarmore's lawyer, David Meier, issued a statement Wednesday saying “the evidence will demonstrate that no criminal conduct took place.” Meier called it a personal matter and said he expected it to be \"resolved in the near future and both parties will move forward together.”\nThe woman told police she took their daughter early the morning of Aug. 8 into Barmore's bedroom, where Barmore was upset because the thermostat was 2 degrees warmer than he preferred. She said their daughter wanted to see him.\nShe claimed Barmore “picked up the child, placed her on the floor just outside the master bedroom, turned back into the room and slammed the door shut,” according to police.\nAs the woman packed her belongings to leave later in the day, Barmore took the phone from her hand and disconnected a call with the woman's mother, according to the criminal complaint. When she headed for the front door to call for help, police said, Barmore allegedly “grabbed her before she could and threw her to the floor.\"\nBarmore grabbed her by the shirt but “eventually let go” and the woman got up, she told police. A car provided by the team picked up the woman and their daughter and drove them to Delaware. She provided police with a photo showing bruises she said occurred when she was thrown to the floor.\nNew England coach Mike Vrabel said Barmore was away from the team with an illness Wednesday but that he hadn’t heard anything that would make him unavailable to play Sunday.\n“We’ve made a statement and we’ve taken the allegations very seriously,” Vrabel said, referring to allegations against both Barmore and receiver Stefon Diggs. Diggs has been charged with felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery in a dispute with his former private chef.\n“I don’t think we have to jump to any sort of conclusions right now. Let the process take its toll,” Vrabel said.\nAn arraignment was scheduled for early February. The charge is a misdemeanor.\nThe team's public relations office emailed a statement saying it had been aware of the matter when it occurred and notified the league.\n“The matter remains part of an ongoing legal process. We will respect that process, continue to monitor the situation closely, as we have over the past few months, and cooperate fully with the league,” the Patriots said.\nBarmore was a second-round pick in 2021 out of the University of Alabama.\n___\nScolforo reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

From bears to deer, moose, and beavers, the province has thriving populations.\nOne of the more exciting animals in the area? The mountain lion, also known as a cougar. But what if one runs right across your path?\nWhat's happening?\nAlberta resident Tina Hayes (@outwestbannockbites) shared a video documenting her husband's recent excursion.\n\"My husband was driving down the back road with his Hunter, and they captured this beautiful cougar. Walking distance from our place!\" Hayes wrote.\nCommenters were keen to share their own experiences with cougars.\n\"Will be hurtful on the deer population. We have one or two in the area that we hunt and it's noticeable how many less deer there are,\" one viewer wrote.\n\"They are way more common than you think,\" another shared.\nWhy is this important?\nAccording to the Government of Alberta, cougars usually live in wooded, rocky areas rather than flat, open terrain. While they occasionally pass through river valleys and other corridors, if they are found in flatter and more residential areas, it's possible they are experiencing habitat loss.\nHabitat loss can be driven by a number of factors, including development projects, which often push into wild spaces. Construction can decimate ecosystems, impact animals' food supplies, and disturb their behavior.\nExacerbated by human-induced changes in weather patterns, wildlife seeking food and water sometimes roam into nearby communities, increasing the chance of human-wildlife encounters.\nDo you think humans are doing enough to protect endangered animals? Click your choice to see results and speak your mind. |\nExperienced at a distance, such encounters can leave human witnesses with a sense of awe, even as they may also be a concerning sign of habitat destruction. Up close, these encounters could mean danger for animals and for humans, including an increased risk of car crashes when animals cross roadways, as in this case in Alberta.\nPushing into new zones could also prove disruptive and dangerous for other species. As one commenter pointed out, ecosystem imbalance could be impactful on deer populations. Down the line, this could have knock-on effects for the plant life deer typically consume.\nWhat's being done?\nThe Alberta government moved to increase cougar hunting, according to a June report from The Narwhal, which quoted conservation specialist Ruiping Luo as saying the hunting quota changes \"were not based on science and there were other factors, like economics, interfering.\"\nWildlife experts generally recommend addressing human-wildlife encounters through land conservation, habitat rehabilitation, transferring animals to safer locations, and prioritizing trail cameras to monitor animal populations and keep people safe.\nIn the meantime, should you encounter a cougar in the wild, officials recommend steps that include backing away, not running, never turning your back, and being prepared to fight back using bear spray and anything else at hand.\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/driver-captures-stunning-video-wild-030000533.html", "published_at": "2026-01-01T03:00:00+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Scout Motors’ decision to sell cars directly to customers triggered fierce backlash from franchise dealers, highlighting long-simmering tensions between traditional retail networks and emerging direct-to-consumer business models.\nThe clash sharpened in Colorado, where the state Motor Vehicle Dealer Board’s decision to grant Scout a dealer license unsettled established dealers, while raising broader questions about the future of auto retailing.\nA New Sales Model Meets Old-Guard Resistance\nScout Motors is a Volkswagen Group-backed EV brand. The company deliberately pursued a sales approach more commonly associated with Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid.\nUnlike conventional manufacturers that rely on independent franchise dealers to sell and service vehicles, Scout intends to manage everything from reservations to delivery through its own facilities and online platform. That model promises transparent pricing, streamlined transactions, and a more controlled experience for customers.\nBut dealers see a threat to the industry’s longstanding franchise system, which they argue has underpinned local economies, provided guaranteed service networks, and protected consumers.\nOn a recent episode of Inside Automotive, industry veteran Mike Maroone, CEO of Mike Maroone Auto and former AutoNation executive, described Colorado’s regulatory approval as a “circumvention of the traditional franchise system” that undermines dealer investments and protections established over decades.\nHe dismissed Scout’s claims of operating separately from its corporate parent, Volkswagen, using a familiar saying to make his point: “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.”\nMaroone’s critique reflects a fundamental dispute about corporate structure and brand identity. Scout insists that it is a distinct brand with its own business model, but dealers counter that financial backing from Volkswagen and deep operational ties make that distinction superficial. They argue that allowing a manufacturer-backed brand to bypass the dealer network sets a worrying precedent that could unravel protections franchisees rely on.\nAn Existential Battle for the Franchise System\nThe Colorado decision is especially significant because the state boasts one of the strongest electric vehicle markets in the country, with roughly 27 percent of all vehicle sales being electric. Federal and state incentives have helped fuel demand, though shifts in incentive structures have recently moderated growth. Even in a strong market, dealers feel pressured as new direct sales approaches gain regulatory footholds.\nMaroone has proposed that dealers consider a multipronged response that could include litigation, negotiation, and political advocacy. He underscored the value of dealer associations in unifying opposition and leveraging political capital to defend the status quo. In his view, the threat is existential rather than theoretical, with manufacturer-owned direct sales potentially eroding the economic foundations of independent dealers.\nThe friction goes beyond Colorado. Dealer groups nationwide, including the National Automobile Dealers Association, have pledged to challenge Scout’s direct-to-consumer strategy in courts and statehouses across the country. These challenges echo earlier disputes over Tesla and other electric vehicle makers that have similarly eschewed franchise networks, testing state franchise laws that were drafted long before internet-based sales were possible.\nIn some states, dealers have already escalated their opposition into litigation. For example, in Florida, Volkswagen and Audi dealers filed a lawsuit claiming Scout’s direct sales violated state law by accepting deposits for vehicles not yet in production. They contended that taking deposits constituted sales under state definitions and sought injunctions to halt the practice. The dispute underscored how legal interpretations of sales activity vary widely across states.\nA Battle Over the Future of Car Buying\nScout’s supporters argue that the direct model aligns with evolving consumer expectations shaped by online retail and digital services. They contend that eliminating intermediaries can reduce friction and cost while offering buyers a more transparent experience. Scout’s leadership has expressed optimism about consumer demand for its Terra pickup and Traveler SUV, even as dealer pushback grows.\nAt its core, the conflict encapsulates a broader industry transformation. Traditional dealers emphasize their local economic impact and service capacity. Direct-to-consumer proponents highlight efficiency and modern customer engagement. As Scout and similar brands expand, the legal, economic, and political wrangling will likely continue, shaping how Americans buy vehicles in the decades ahead.", "url": "https://autos.yahoo.com/policy-and-environment/articles/us-auto-dealers-drags-scout-171509642.html", "published_at": "2025-12-31T17:15:09+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

But when combined with the other materials used in computers, some of which are toxic and can seep out of landfills and into soil and water, this is a genuine source of pollution.\nIs Microsoft doing anything about this?\nMicrosoft took some small steps to slightly stagger the retirement of Windows 10 PCs, such as continuing to provide security updates for a little longer.\nHowever, this only draws out the problem; it does not reduce the total number of machines that must be discarded because they cannot be upgraded to Windows 11.\nWhat can I do about obsolete electronics?\nIf you have a PC or laptop that you cannot upgrade to the new edition of Windows, don't just throw it away.\nYou can likely get money for it through the right programs, because even if you don't have a use for it yourself, the computer or its parts may be useful to someone else.

The goal comes as Tokyo’s main ally, the United States, pushes for more military assistance in Asia and a military hawk and ultra-conservative takes over Japan's leadership.\nJapan says it is still a peaceful nation and the buildup is necessary for a more self-reliant military that can better deter China. But Beijing and other critics see Japan as deviating from its postwar peace pledge, pointing to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's statement soon after taking office that any Chinese military action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response.\nJapan’s transformation into one of the world’s major defense spenders has developed over decades and raises the question of whether the ongoing buildup is a violation of its pacifist constitution.\nHere is a closer look.\nJapan’s constitution has been hollowed out\nAfter World War II, Japan was not supposed to have a military.\nDuring the 1945-1952 U.S. occupation, American officials wanted to stamp out the militarism that led to Japanese aggression across Asia before and during the war.\nUnder Article 9 of the U.S.-drafted 1947 constitution, Japan renounced the use of force to settle international disputes, and the right to maintain land, sea and air forces for that purpose.\nThe U.S. changed its mind about Japanese militarism when the Korean War started in 1950. Japan became an ally, not a threat, leading to the creation of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces in 1954. Article 9 is now widely seen as the legal basis for Japan to have a sufficient military to defend itself.\nJapan has since repeatedly stretched the definition of self-defense, allowing overseas dispatches of its troops as part of international peacekeeping operations, though mostly avoiding combat missions.\nA big change came in 2014, under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who wanted Japan to have a normal military. Abe newly interpreted Article 9 as legalizing collective defense. The following year, a security law allowed Japan to use force if the United States or other friendly nations come under enemy attack, even if Japan is not being attacked.\nThis was Abe’s attempt to have a normal military without formally changing the constitution.\nTakaichi angered China by giving a hypothetical example of such a situation, a deviation from former leaders’ strategic ambiguity.\nTensions with China worsen\nThe flap with Beijing escalated in December when Chinese aircraft locked their radars, considered possible preparation for firing missiles, on Japanese planes during Chinese aircraft carrier drills near southwestern Japan.\nTwo Chinese aircraft carriers also were spotted in June operating near the southern Japanese island of Iwo Jima for the first time. This led to worry in Tokyo about Beijing’s rapidly expanding military activity far beyond its borders and in areas around islands claimed by both countries.\nTakaichi’s Cabinet last week approved a record defense budget plan. It exceeds 9 trillion yen ($58 billion) for the coming year and aims to fortify its strike-back capability and coastal defense with cruise missiles and unmanned arsenals.\nIn Beijing later that day, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized the Takaichi government for accelerating the pace of its military buildup and expansion, and added: “Japan is deviating from the path of peaceful development it has long claimed to uphold and is moving further and further in a dangerous direction.”\nChina, which spends a huge amount on its own defense, may also see Takaichi as a defender of Japanese wartime aggression. Before taking office, she was a regular at Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan’s 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals. Victims of Japanese aggression, especially China and the Koreas, see visits to the shrine as tantamount to a lack of remorse about Japan’s wartime past.\nTakaichi stayed away from Yasukuni in 2025 and sent a religious ornament marking the Aug. 15 anniversary of Japan’s defeat as a personal gesture instead of praying at the shrine.\nJapan takes on more offensive roles\nA fundamental change came in December 2022 when former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s government adopted a security strategy stating the need for Japan to acquire strike-back capability with long-range missiles, a major break from Japan’s self-defense-only policy.\nThe strategy names China as Japan’s biggest strategic challenge and calls for a more offensive role for Japanese troops under its security alliance with the U.S as the allies work more closely together.\nMasahiro Sakata, former head of the Cabinet Legislative Bureau, described the move as “the death of Article 9.”\nAfter the war, Japan long prioritized economic development over defense while relying largely on the U.S. by hosting about 50,000 American troops who also serve the region.\nJapan maintained a defense spending cap of 1% of GDP until the annual defense budget started to rise under Abe’s nearly decade-long leadership, to about 1.1%. Takaichi is certain to achieve a 2% target by March, two years earlier than planned, and is expected to push for more spending in coming years as Japan is under growing pressure after NATO adopted a new target of 5%.\nJapan plans to promote defense industry\nTakaichi’s revised security and defense policy would aim to further bolster Japan with unmanned combative weapons and long-range missiles. It is expected to scrap remaining restrictions on arms exports to promote the development of Japan’s defense industry and cooperation with friendly nations.\nJapan has long banned arms exports but has significantly eased restrictions in recent years and is now developing next-generation fighter jets with the UK and Italy while finalizing a deal to sell frigates to Australia. Japan also will to provide support for construction and maintenance for U.S. warships.\nA government-commissioned panel has proposed Japan consider developing a nuclear submarine to achieve a more long-distance deterrence capability, a controversial idea for a country that has long maintained non-nuclear principles.\nJapan has requested Washington ensure protection through the extended deterrence of nuclear weapons. A number of officials recently expressed support for Japan’s nuclear possession, which has led to criticism from Japanese atomic bomb survivors and other pacifist groups.\nJapan stands by its three non-nuclear principles of not possessing, not producing and not allowing its presence, according to Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, although he said Japan is considering all options for a possible new submarine.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/pacifist-japan-slowly-transformed-exclusively-120215058.html", "published_at": "2025-12-31T12:02:15+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Thick clouds of dust rose over the camp as residents watched from a distance, according to an AFP news agency journalist at the scene.\n“Being torn away from our homes, our neighbourhoods and our memories is deeply painful,” said Mutaz Mahr, whose building was among those destroyed.\n“The occupation tries by every means to wear us down and pressure us,” he told AFP, referring to Israel.\n“Our home is dear to us, the memories are dear to us, the family, the neighbours, and the good people are dear to us,” he said as bulldozers advanced. “The first time, our grandparents were displaced, and this is the second time.”\nMahr said he and about 25 relatives were sheltering in a 100-square-metre (120-square-yard) apartment after being driven out of the camp.\nThe Israeli military claimed the demolitions formed part of an operation against Palestinian resistance groups, a claim that could not be independently verified. Palestinian residents and rights groups say the destruction amounts to collective punishment and forced displacement under occupation.\nNihaya al-Jendi, a member of Nur Shams’s popular committee, said the scale of displacement had already reached crisis levels before the latest raid.\n“Today, more than 1,500 families from the camp are still unable to return,” Jendi told AFP. “This is a major catastrophe – a real humanitarian disaster for Palestinian refugees – unfolding before the eyes of the world.”\nIsrael launched what it calls a security operation earlier this year targeting refugee camps in the northern West Bank, including Nur Shams, Tulkarem and Jenin.\nAt least 850 homes have been demolished or severely damaged across the three camps, according to Human Rights Watch, which analysed satellite imagery. The group said the destruction appears designed to carve out “clear buffer” zones and permanently reshape the camps’ urban fabric, tightening Israeli control.\nMore settlements approved\nAs refugee homes are reduced to rubble, Israel is pushing ahead with illegal settlement expansion. On Wednesday, Israeli authorities approved plans for 126 settler housing units in the Sa-Nur outpost in the northern West Bank, according to Israeli media.\nChannel 7 reported that the High Planning Council, operating under Israel’s Civil Administration, greenlit a detailed plan that would allow illegal settlers to return to Sa-Nur, which was evacuated in 2005.\nThe outpost was dismantled under then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon’s unilateral disengagement plan, which removed settlements from Gaza and four northern West Bank sites. That policy was reversed in March 2024 when Israel’s parliament repealed the disengagement law through legislation known as the “Cancellation of the Disengagement Law”.\nChannel 7 said the new plan could take effect within two months.\nIsraeli moves against the UN\nThe demolitions and settlement approvals come as Israel escalates pressure on the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned an Israeli move to cut electricity or water to facilities owned by UNRWA, his spokesperson said on Wednesday.\nThe measure would “further impede” the agency’s ability to function, the spokesperson added. “The Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations remains applicable to UNRWA, its property and assets,” said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, stressing that UNRWA is an “integral” part of the UN system.\nUNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini denounced the decision as part of a “systematic campaign to discredit UNRWA and thereby obstruct” its work supporting Palestinian refugees.\nIn 2024, Israel’s parliament passed a law banning the agency from operating in the country and barring officials from contact with it. UNRWA continues to operate in occupied East Jerusalem, which the UN recognises as occupied territory despite Israel’s annexation claims.\nThe agency provides education, healthcare and humanitarian aid to millions of Palestinians across Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. As Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza grinds on, critics say the parallel assault on UNRWA and West Bank communities signals a broader effort to dismantle the refugee question altogether.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/israel-escalates-west-bank-demolitions-074631417.html", "published_at": "2026-01-01T07:46:31+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

In the eastern city of Leipzig, where riots broke out in previous years, police and first responders were attacked with fireworks.\nIn the western city of Bielefeld, two 18-year-old men died after suffering fatal facial injuries in separate accidents involving homemade fireworks.\nBerlin welcomed 2026 with a seven-and-a-half-minute fireworks display at the Brandenburg Gate and countless private fireworks. The capital's traditional New Year's Eve party featuring live performances was cancelled after the city government said it would no longer fund it, and was replaced with a DJ party at the Berlin landmark.\nMeanwhile in Hamburg, thousands of people welcomed in 2026 at public broadcaster ZDF's New Year's Eve show in rainy weather. For the first time, the \"Silvester in Concert\" show did not take place in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin but on a floating stage on the Elbe in front of the Westfield shopping centre.\nAt midnight, there was a spectacular fireworks display, which was set off by tugs behind the stage.\nIn Hamburg, organizers said that around 10,000 people celebrated the arrival of 2026 at a large New Year's Eve party on Ludwigstraße. Everything was very peaceful, said Katrin Strauch from event agency Gral. \"There were no incidents, nothing at all.\"\nThose who welcomed the New Year outside were best advised to dress warmly. In parts of Germany, the German Weather Service advised caution due to snow and slippery conditions. In the north, it was expected to become increasingly stormy on Thursday morning.\nBerlin New Year's celebrations calmer than in past\nBerlin Police spokesman Florian Nath told dpa in a preliminary assessment that, as of 3 am, police had \"no reports of serious injuries among our colleagues or among revellers. Nor did we have any serious incidents or property damage like last year.\"\nPolice officers were however attacked with fireworks, 21 of them suffering minor injuries.\nMore in U.S.\nThe police were partially successful in countering the dynamics of criminal perpetrators who moved among the crowd of peaceful revellers. The concept of a large firework-free zone worked particularly well at Alexanderplatz.\nThe demonstration and party at the Victory Column were peaceful. Instead of the 16,000 participants who had registered, only a few hundred showed up, according to the spokesperson. The celebration at the Brandenburg Gate, which attracted many thousands of visitors, also passed without incident.\nPolice in Leipzig attacked with fireworks\nIn Leipzig, police and emergency services were attacked with fireworks, according to a police spokesperson. Among other measures, the police erected barriers in the Connewitz district, which is known for riots.\nHowever, the incidents and fires in Leipzig were not limited to the known areas; there were also several fires in Leipzig city centre, where rubbish bins were set alight.\nIn recent years, there have been regular riots in Leipzig on New Year's Eve. Even before the turn of the year, police warned that it was not only the Connewitz district that could be affected.\nFire brigades constantly at work\nThere were also incidents in Hamburg during the night: according to police, passers-by and emergency services were pelted with fireworks in the Steilshoop district. No injuries were initially reported. Suspected perpetrators were identified, but it was initially unclear whether they had been arrested.\nFire brigades are also in constant action: fires were reported in several federal states during the night. Roof trusses were on fire, as were rubbish bins, hedges and cars. An initial assessment was not expected until New Year's Day.\nDiscussion of firework ban\nThis year, as in the past, many groups, from health professionals to environmentalists, called for a ban on fireworks in the run-up to New Year's Eve.\nDoctors' representatives, police officers and animal rights activists all suggested a general ban on the use of private firecrackers and rockets due to the number of injuries caused.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/attacks-police-arrests-germany-nation-041031885.html", "published_at": "2026-01-01T04:10:31+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

This attention focuses not only on business ethics but also on the apparent contradictions between Mynett’s commercial interests and the religious identity central to Omar’s public persona.\nMynett, a political consultant turned venture capitalist, is currently the subject of a lawsuit alleging fraud and breach of contract in connection with \"eStCru,\" a California-based wine business in which he is a partner.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Washington, DC, claims that Mynett and his business partner, Will Hailer, defrauded investor Naeem Mohd. According to court documents, Mohd alleges he was persuaded to invest $300,000 based on a guarantee of a 200% return within 18 months, but the plaintiff's promises were never fulfilled.\nAlthough the principal investment was reportedly repaid after a delay, the lawsuit alleges that the promised profits were never paid. It accuses the partners of misrepresenting the company’s financial health. Mynett has denied the allegations, characterizing the matter as a contract dispute.\nThe wine business and Islamic law\nBeyond the financial dispute, the wine business's existence has raised eyebrows among observers of Omar’s career.\nA spokesperson for the congresswoman stated that Omar and Mynett married \"Islamically and legally\" in 2020. Traditional Sunni Islam, to which Omar belongs, religiously forbids a Muslim woman from marrying a non-Muslim man. The statement implied that Mynett had either converted to Islam or that the couple had undertaken a religious ceremony satisfying Sharia requirements.\nHowever, the production, sale, and consumption of alcohol are strictly prohibited by Islamic law (haram). Mynett’s active role at a winery and the specific pursuit of profit from alcohol sales present a theological conflict with the faith Omar frequently cites as a guiding moral compass in her legislative work.\nThe congresswoman has not publicly addressed this discrepancy. Her office has maintained a strict separation between her legislative duties and her husband’s private ventures, stating she has no involvement in his business dealings.\nThis is not the first time Mynett’s finances have intersected with Omar’s political life. During her 2020 re-election campaign, Mynett’s consulting firm, the E Street Group, received nearly $3 million from Omar’s campaign funds. While the Federal Election Commission (FEC) found no legal wrongdoing, the arrangement drew sharp bipartisan criticism and accusations of ethical impropriety.\nMynett is also facing legal pressure on other fronts. His venture capital firm, eSt Ventures, was recently sued by South Dakota cannabis companies for failing to fulfill fundraising commitments. Reports indicate the firm admitted to owing investors over $1 million.\nFor Omar, a leading figure in the progressive \"Squad\" known for moral absolutism on issues of justice, the silence regarding her husband’s involvement in the alcohol industry and the allegations of defrauding investors stands out as a notable divergence from her usual vocal stance on accountability.\nReuters contributed to this report.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fraud-claims-wine-money-sharia-083519424.html", "published_at": "2026-01-01T08:35:19+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

During President Donald Trump's first administration, James began investigating his business practices in New York, and in 2024, a judge found that Trump fraudulently overstated his net worth to deceive lenders.\nMore in U.S.\nThe Trump administration has targeted James during his second term, accusing her of mortgage fraud.\nGrant Reeher, a Syracuse University political science professor, said James's role in the inauguration would send a message to core supporters that Mamdani is \"going to be independent of the president.”\nNew York City's first Muslim mayor\nThe Uganda-born Mamdani, who will be New York City's first Muslim mayor, has been a sharp critic of Trump on issues such as immigration and said his differences with the president were numerous after a warm White House meeting.\nBut being sworn in by the state attorney general may say more about Mamdani's political alliances than rivalries. In 2014, Bill de Blasio, whom Mamdani regards as the best New York City mayor of his lifetime, was sworn in privately by then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman at the start of the first of his two terms.\nSenator Bernie Sanders, a progressive Brooklyn-born Vermont senator whom Mamdani calls his inspiration, presided over de Blasio's 2018 public inauguration and will play a similar role for Mamdani. Liberal Democratic US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is also on the agenda for the inauguration ceremony.\nPlans for Mamdani's public inauguration include a ceremony on City Hall's steps and a program of music and speeches for 4,000 guests in City Hall Plaza. In addition, tens of thousands of people will be able to watch a livestream of what Mamdani's team has dubbed the “Inauguration of a New Era” in free viewing areas set up along Broadway.\nMamdani raised $2.6 million for the transition and celebrations from nearly 30,000 contributors, more than other mayors on record this century, both in total and in single donations, according to official campaign data that presents disclosures of inaugural expenses beginning with Michael Bloomberg's first term in 2001.\nSami Zaman, the owner of Astoria's low-key Afghan restaurant Sami's Kabab House, where Astoria resident Mamdani filmed a campaign video with Sanders, was on the inaugural committee alongside filmmakers, writers, and activists.\nAfter becoming mayor, Mamdani will move from his one-bedroom Astoria apartment, protected from sharp price hikes by the city rent-stabilization program, to Gracie Mansion, the official residence of New York City mayors on Manhattan's upscale Upper East Side.\nBankers and others in New York, the nation's financial capital, had expressed concern about Mamdani, but since his election, many have explored how to work with him.\nThe city has had another mayor associated with democratic socialism, David Dinkins. Dinkins did not make much of his association with the Democratic Socialists of America. During his 1990-1993 term, he overcame budget deficits and persuaded private businesses to remain in New York, according to city archivists.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/mayor-york-rings-2026-zohran-081759942.html", "published_at": "2026-01-01T08:17:59+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

More free national park days\nThere will be more free entry dates at national parks in 2026, but only U.S. residents will be eligible for these \"patriotic fee-free days.\"\nPresident’s Day: Feb. 16\nMemorial Day: May 31\nFlag Day/President Donald Trump’s birthday: June 14\nIndependence Day weekend: July 3–5\n110th Birthday of the National Park Service: Aug. 25\nConstitution Day: Sept. 17\nTheodore Roosevelt’s birthday: Oct. 27\nVeterans Day: Nov. 11\nIn recent years, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the first day of National Park Week, Juneteenth, Great American Outdoors Act signing Day, and National Public Lands Day have been free-entry days for all visitors, in addition to Veterans Day.\nMost of the 433 sites in the National Park System do not charge entry fees, but many of the most popular ones do. Entry fees typically top out at $35 per private vehicle.\nTravelers can see which parks charge fees and how much they cost on the National Park Service's website.\nFree park days: Americans react to national parks ditching free entry on Juneteenth, MLK Day\n2. Higher fees for foreign tourists\nEffective Jan. 1, \"nonresidents without an annual pass will pay a $100 per person fee to enter 11 of the most visited national parks, in addition to the standard entrance fee,\" among other charges, the Department of Interior announced in late November.\nAffected national parks:\nAcadia National Park in Maine\nBryce Canyon National Park in Utah\nEverglades National Park in Florida\nGlacier National Park in Montana\nGrand Canyon National Park in Arizona\nGrand Teton National Park in Wyoming\nRocky Mountain National Park in Colorado\nSequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks in California\nYellowstone National Park in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming\nYosemite National Park in California\nZion National Park in Utah\nSequoia and Kings Canyon are technically different parks, but they operate as one.\nAlso starting Jan. 1, non-U.S. residents will have to pay more for the America the Beautiful annual pass. The public lands pass will cost them $250, while U.S. residents will continue to pay $80 for a year-long access.\n\"These policies ensure that U.S. taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a news release in line with an executive order designed to \"allow more Americans to visit national parks.\"\nResidents will be asked to enter their ZIP code when buying passes through Recreation.gov and show a U.S. government-issued photo ID when using the passes. Visitors without such identification will be asked to upgrade to a nonresident annual pass, according to the Interior Department. It also said existing passes will continue to be honored until expiration.\n3. New digital park passes\nNew digital America the Beautiful passes have been rolled out for annual passholders, military, seniors, fourth graders, visitors with disabilities and volunteers with at least 250 hours of service at federal recreation sites.\nPasses will also cover two motorcycles per pass instead of one.\nThey can be stored on mobile devices and linked to physical cards for user convenience. In the past, if a visitor purchased an annual pass and lost the physical card, they'd have to buy a new one.\nMore in U.S.\nBoth digital and physical passes feature new artwork with \"patriotic designs that honor America’s landscapes, heritage and outdoor legacy,\" the Interior Department said. One pass features presidents George Washington and Donald Trump side by side.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 3 national park changes visitors should know for 2026", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/3-big-changes-americas-national-080141812.html", "published_at": "2026-01-01T08:01:41+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Bernie Sanders, one of the mayor’s political heroes. That will be followed by what his office is billing as a public block party on a stretch of Broadway known as the “Canyon of Heroes,” famous for its ticker-tape parades.\nMamdani now begins one of the most unrelenting jobs in American politics as one of the country’s most-watched politicians.\nIn addition to being the city's first Muslim mayor, Mamdani is also its first of South Asian descent and the first to be born in Africa. At 34, Mamdani is also the city’s youngest mayor in generations.\nIn a campaign that helped make “affordability” a buzzword across the political spectrum, the democratic socialist promised to bring transformative change with policies intended to lower the cost of living in one of the world’s most expensive cities. His platform included free child care, free buses, a rent freeze for about 1 million households, and a pilot of city-run grocery stores.\nBut he will also have to face other responsibilities: handling trash and snow and rats, while getting blamed for subway delays and potholes.\nMamdani was born in Kampala, Uganda, the son of filmmaker Mira Nair and Mahmood Mamdani, an academic and author. His family moved to New York City when he was 7, with Mamdani growing up in a post-9/11 city where Muslims didn’t always feel welcome. He became an American citizen in 2018.\nMore in U.S.\nHe worked on political campaigns for Democratic candidates in the city before he sought public office himself, winning a state Assembly seat in 2020 to represent a section of Queens.\nMamdani and his wife, Rama Duwaji, will depart their one-bedroom, rent stabilized apartment in the outer-borough to take up residence in the stately mayoral residence in Manhattan.\nMamdani inherits a city on the upswing, after years of slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Violent crime has dropped to pre-pandemic lows. Tourists are back. Unemployment, which soared during the pandemic years, is also back to pre-COVID levels.\nYet deep concerns remain about high prices and rising rents in the city.\nHe’ll also have to deal with Republican President Donald Trump.\nDuring the mayoral race, Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from the city if Mamdani won and mused about sending National Guard troops to the city.\nBut Trump surprised supporters and foes alike by inviting the Democrat to the White House for what ended up being a cordial meeting in November.\n“I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job,” Trump said.\nStill, tensions between the two leaders are almost certain to resurface, given their deep policy disagreements, particularly over immigration.\nMamdani also faces skepticism and opposition from some members of the city’s Jewish community over his criticisms of Israel’s government.\nThe new mayor and his team have spent the weeks since his election victory preparing for the transition, surrounding Mamdani with seasoned hands who have worked inside or alongside city government.\nThat included persuading the city’s police commissioner, Jessica Tisch, to remain in her position — a move that helped calm fears in the business community that the administration might be planning radical changes in policing strategy.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/zohran-mamdani-sworn-york-city-050506468.html", "published_at": "2026-01-01T05:05:06+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The Treasury Department at the time described the consortium, launched by former Israeli intelligence official Tal Dilian, as \"a complex international web of decentralized companies that built and commercialized a comprehensive suite of highly invasive spyware products.\"\nA Treasury spokesman declined to comment.\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the removal \"was done as part of the normal administrative process in response to a petition request for reconsideration.\" The official added that each of the individuals had \"demonstrated measures to separate themselves from the Intellexa Consortium.\"\nIntellexa representatives did not immediately respond to email messages requesting comment.\nThe notice said sanctions were lifted on Sara Hamou, whom the U.S. government accused of providing managerial services to Intellexa, Andrea Gambazzi, whose company was alleged by the U.S. government to have held the distribution rights to the Predator spyware, and Merom Harpaz, described by U.S. officials as a top executive in the consortium.\nGambazzi, Hamou and Harpaz did not immediately reply to messages sent to them directly or to their representatives.

Public golf courses\nBy Jeff Mason\nWASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration this week canceled a lease held by the nonprofit National Links Trust to oversee three public golf courses in Washington, a fresh opportunity for the president to put his stamp on a part of city life.\nIn a letter to NLT on Tuesday, Trump's Interior Department said it was terminating the 50-year-lease the group received in 2020 to run the golf courses. The agency accused the nonprofit of failing to make required investments in the properties and failing to pay rent.\nNLT disputed the allegations that it had defaulted on its lease or not paid what was required. It said the Interior Department had provided little information about the issue.\n\"Our lease allows rent to be offset by course improvements and rent offsets were approved by the National Park Service,\" it said in an emailed statement. \"NLT has worked hand in hand with the National Park Service over five years and the first we heard about any rent issue was in the last few weeks, after we received the default notice.\"\nThe National Park Service is part of the Interior Department.\nTrump, a Republican who came back into power earlier this year, has swept through Washington on multiple fronts since his return, deploying the National Guard to patrol its streets, renaming the Kennedy Center performing-arts venue as the Trump-Kennedy Center via a board he installed, and threatening to take over control of city government.\nThe president's actions locally mirror his governing nationally, where Trump has launched onslaughts against universities, law firms, the media and other institutions, and levied tariffs that upended international relationships and caused swings in financial markets.\nAn avid golfer himself, Trump owns private golf courses all over the world, including one in nearby Virginia.\nThe NLT has overseen three public courses in Washington: East Potomac Park, Rock Creek Park and Langston Golf Course. The Interior Department said in its letter that NLT had not done capital improvements or renovations at each course that were required as part of the lease and had not shown the National Parks Service that it had a plan to do so.\n\"NLT failed to provide NPS with reasonable assurances that NLT has the necessary funding, ability or plan in place to fulfill its capital investment obligations,\" it said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.\nThe organization said it would continue to administer the golf courses for the time being to keep them open.

{"article_id": "03634de4d5c7a8c2", "source": "yahoo", "headline": "7 takeaways from Jack Smith’s congressional testimony", "body": "", "content": "7 takeaways from Jack Smith’s congressional testimony\nHouse Republicans decided to publicly release the transcript of special counsel Jack Smith’s Dec. 17 closed-door deposition on New Year’s Eve — while most of Washington was tuned out for the holiday.\nSmith used the day-long grilling before the House Judiciary Committee to mount a robust defense of his investigation into Donald Trump for seeking to subvert the 2020 election. He forcefully rebutted claims that his work was tainted by politics and delivered a granular defense of his office’s tactics and prosecution strategy — all while repeatedly restating his view that Trump was guilty of a historic crime. He also revealed some new information about his witness list, and gave Judiciary Republicans a new opening to attack Cassidy Hutchinson’s infamous testimony.\nA spokesperson for Smith declined to comment.\nHere’s what we learned from the 255-page transcript:\nSmith built his case around Trump’s allies\nSome of Smith’s most substantive testimony centered on his never-implemented trial strategy: using Republicans who believed in Trump to make the case against him.\n“The president was preying on the party allegiance of people who supported him,” Smith said. “The evidence that I felt was most powerful was the evidence that came from people in his own party who … put country before party and were willing to tell the truth to him, even though it could mean trouble for them.”\nSmith repeatedly drew on diehard Republicans to make the case against the man they wanted to become president but who they acknowledged had been defeated. Smith said former Vice President Mike Pence and several of the GOP elector nominees — like Pennsylvania’s Lawrence Tabas — would have fit that bill and made strong trial witnesses.\n“That witness, Mr. Tabas, was of a similar group of witnesses who — these are not enemies of the president. These are people in his party who supported him,” Smith continued. “And I think the fact that they were telling him these things … would have had great weight and great credibility with a jury.”\nSmith said he came to believe that Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, tweet attacking Pence while he was at the Capitol “without question” exacerbated the danger to Pence’s life.\nSmith hadn’t made his final charging decisions\nThe former special counsel said he never officially decided whether to bring additional charges against the figures he alleged were Trump’s co-conspirators — including attorneys Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Kenneth Chesebro, John Eastman and Boris Epshteyn.\n“I had not made final determinations about that at the time that President Trump won reelection, meaning that our office was going to be closed down,” Smith said.\nSmith said he had no plans to call Eastman — an architect of Trump’s last-ditch bid to stop Joe Biden’s Electoral College certification in January 2021 — as a trial witness but said he would have welcomed Trump calling Eastman to the stand as a defense witness.\nSmith noted he interviewed Epshteyn, Giuliani and other alleged co-conspirators in the course of the investigation.\nLawmakers failed to knock Smith off his game\nThe former special counsel repeatedly leaned into the defense of his probe and expressed confidence that a jury would have convicted Trump if the case went to trial.\nHe refused to take Democrats’ bait to attack Republicans for refusing, so far, to give him a public hearing. And he avoided straying into discussions that might have forced him to reveal subjects still protected by grand jury secrecy or a federal judge’s order that barred him from disclosing details of his second investigation into President Trump’s hoarding of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office in 2021.\n“Did you have the opportunity to interview Mr. Pence as part of your investigation?” a staffer asked Smith at one point.\nMore in Politics\nTrump, 79, Falls for Karoline Leavitt ‘Rate My Butt’ Account\n“I think the answer to that question might involve [grand jury information], and so I'm not going to answer that,” Smith said.\nWhen Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) pressed Smith about the structure of his classified documents report, Smith again demurred.\n“I don't think I should even talk about that. I don't want to have any — any implication that I gave some sort of insight about how that report is constructed,’ he said.\nSmith repeatedly reminded lawmakers that he’s open to sharing the results of his classified documents investigation, but was restricted by the ruling from a federal judge in Florida who maintained Smith's report must stay under seal. The day of Smith’s deposition, the Department of Justice also sent an email to Smith’s team emphasizing the court order prevented him from sharing nonpublic information with Congress.\nAt one point, a staffer questioning Smith suggested it would be far more difficult to retrieve materials from Mar-a-Lago compared to elsewhere.\n“I mean, a person can't just walk into Mar-a-Lago and try to abscond with these materials, right?” the person, whose identity was redacted, asked.\n“I would very much like to answer that question, but I cannot answer that question due to the final report,” Smith responded.\nSmith forcefully rejected any hint of political bias\nRepublicans and Democrats repeatedly teed it up for him: Did politics influence Smith’s decision to become special counsel or the way he handled his investigation? Did the White House ever lean on him or senior Justice Department officials like former Attorney General Merrick Garland and his deputy Lisa Monaco?\nEach time Smith was unequivocal: Not for a moment.\nSmith maintained he never communicated with Biden or White House staff before or during his investigation. He also said the timing of Trump’s announcement for president, his crowded calendar of criminal cases leading up to the 2024 election and the sensitivity of certain allegations were nonfactors in his decisions. He emphasized that he regularly consulted with Justice Department officials to ensure he abided by its guidelines.\n“We certainly were not in any way intending to affect the outcome of the election. And to make sure we complied with the policy, we met with Public Integrity to make sure we were doing that,” Smith said.\nMultiple people also asked Smith if he would be surprised if Trump directs his Department of Justice to target him. The former special counsel responded no.\n“I have no doubt that the president wants to seek retribution against me,” Smith said.\nLawmakers also pressed Smith about the executive order against his legal representation, Covington & Burling, in which Trump suspended security clearances for firm employees who had worked with Smith. It was one of several major law firms hit with penalties in the beginning of the second Trump administration.\n“I think it's to chill people from having an association with me,” Smith said.\nSmith didn’t pursue ‘uncooperative’ witnesses\nThough there were few new details in Smith’s testimony, he disclosed that he didn’t pursue interviews with three figures close to Trump: Steve Bannon, Roger Stone and Peter Navarro. The reason, he said, was they were relatively uncooperative with congressional investigators and were unnecessary for his team to discern the details of Trump’s bid to subvert the 2020 election.\n“Given the highly uncooperative nature of the individuals you talked about, I didn't think it would be fruitful to try to question them,” Smith said. “And the sort of information that they could provide us, in my view, wasn't worth immunizing them for their possible conduct.”\nBut Smith also described a text exchange between Bannon and Epshteyn on the evening of Jan. 6 in which Bannon described Trump as “still on fire” — an exchange he said was evidence that Trump did not see the riot as the end of his effort to prevent his defeat in the election.\nSmith defends pursuit of lawmakers’ phone records\nRepublicans and Democrats pressed Smith extensively about his pursuit of the phone records of Republican lawmakers who Trump and his allies contacted during the days and weeks before Jan. 6, 2021.\nSmith said he wanted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s records because he knew McCarthy spoke to the White House as violence unfolded that day. He also said the records they pursued were limited and intended to shore up the case if it went to trial — and all were obtained in accordance with DOJ policies governing the handling of investigations that touch on congressional records.\nSmith also emphasized he was not special counsel when Justice Department investigators obtained a two-year batch of House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan’s phone records.\nThe former special counsel displayed detailed knowledge about the way the Constitution’s Speech or Debate clause protects legislative activity from federal investigators and said he sought to comply with those limits. He noted that his office litigated Speech or Debate issues related to Pence and Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) during the course of the probe.\n“My office and I personally take the protections of the Speech or Debate Clause seriously,” he said. “They're an important part of separation of powers.”\nHouse GOP revel in Smith comments on Cassidy Hutchinson\nIn the aftermath of the transcript’s release, the Judiciary Republicans pointed to Smith’s comments about Cassidy Hutchinson, the former White House aide who in 2022 testified against Trump in a dramatic hearing before the Democratic-led Jan. 6 committee.\nHutchinson famously said another Trump aide told her that a furious Trump lunged for the wheel after learning the vehicle he was in was headed for the White House instead of the Capitol after his incendiary Jan. 6 speech. Trump has long denied the incident.\nSmith told congressional investigators his office spoke to at least one officer who was in the SUV for Trump’s return to the White House that day.\n“[M]y recollection with Ms. Hutchinson, at least one of the issues was a number of the things that she gave evidence on were secondhand hearsay, were things that she had heard from other people and, as a result, that testimony may or may not be admissible, and it certainly wouldn’t be as powerful as firsthand testimony,” Smith said.\n“The partisan January 6th Committee’s ENTIRE case was just destroyed by… Jack Smith,” the Judiciary GOP posted on X. “Star witness completely unreliable!”\nThe Jan. 6 committee grilled Hutchinson in part because Mark Meadows, her direct boss, declined to sit for an interview. Though Hutchinson’s story was among the most explosive aspects of its public hearings, the case the committee made — that Trump systematically attempted to sow doubt about the 2020 election results and lean on state and federal officials to subvert it — was the product of hundreds of interviews, many from Trump’s closest aides and allies.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/7-takeaways-jack-smith-congressional-231404118.html", "published_at": "2025-12-31T23:14:04+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

(AP) — Montana’s Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a misconduct case against the state’s attorney general after he defied court orders in a dispute over a law that gave the governor more power over the judiciary.\nA court-appointed panel last year found that Republican Attorney General Austin Knudsen repeatedly attacked the integrity of the justices in his defense of a 2021 law permitting the state’s Republican governor to directly fill judicial vacancies.\nThe panel had recommended that Knudsen's license to practice law be suspended for 90 days.\nJustices agreed in Wednesday's ruling that Knudsen had violated rules of professional conduct for attorneys.

He said in a statement Wednesday that the complaint against him had been a distraction.\n“I appreciate the Supreme Court bringing this frivolous complaint to a long-overdue conclusion,” Knudsen said. “We’ve said it from the very beginning, this was nothing more than a political stunt.”\nChief Justice Cory Swanson wrote that Wednesday’s order amounted to a “public admonition” over Knudsen’s misconduct.\n“We plainly warn all Montana attorneys, including Knudsen and his subordinates, to obey lawful orders of all courts,” Swanson wrote.\nThe dispute between Montana’s chief law enforcement officer and its high court centered on a law that was part of a nationwide GOP effort to forge a more conservative judiciary and was eventually upheld by Montana’s Supreme Court.\nIn his defense of the Legislature and the 2021 law, Knudsen's office in court filings accused Supreme Court justices of judicial misconduct, corruption, self-dealing, “actual impropriety” and having a conflict of interest.\nFollowing a complaint against Knudsen, the 13-member panel — a group of lawyers and others known as the Commission on Practice of the Montana Supreme Court — determined that the attorney general’s office “repeatedly, consistently and undeniably,” violated professional conduct rules.\nKnudsen had argued that any punishment should have been handled privately.\nMore in U.S.\nSwanson wrote Wednesday that the extensive litigation in the case was “far worse” than a private admonition that had been previously considered.\nAll but two of the court’s seven justices recused themselves from Knudsen’s case because of their involvement in the dispute with his office. They were replaced by five district court judges and joined by newly elected Chief Justice Swanson and Justice Katherine Bidegaray.\nSix of the seven sitting justices rejected the recommendation to suspend Knudsen, with only Bidegaray dissenting. She said Knudsen’s actions merited a public censure and 30-day suspension.\n“Erasing a complete disciplinary record is inconsistent with our constitutional responsibility and our precedent,” Bidegaray wrote. “Discipline is not punitive; it is protective—of the public, the courts, and the profession—and serves to preserve confidence in the fair and orderly administration of justice.”\nThe court unanimously rejected Knudsen's claims that as Montana's attorney general he was exempt from the disciplinary proceedings against him. Swanson wrote that it would be “unwise” to allow the attorney general to supervise hundreds of attorneys while exempting him from basic ethical standards of the profession.\nKnudsen acknowledged during a hearing last fall that a lot of things should have been done differently in representing the Legislature over the extent of its subpoena powers.\n“If I had this to do over, I probably would not have allowed language like this — so sharp — to be used,” Knudsen testified.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/montana-supreme-court-dismisses-misconduct-224815605.html", "published_at": "2025-12-31T22:48:15+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

But while Morgan Stanely analysts led by Joseph Moore have buy ratings on both chip stocks, Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) is their top pick within in the semiconductor industry for 2026.\nReaders should be aware that most Wall Street analysts have a different opinion.\nAmong 69 analysts, Nvidia has a median target price of $250 per share. That implies 33% upside from its current share price of $187.\nAmong 52 analysts, Broadcom has a median target price of $460 per share. That implies 31% upside from its current share price of $350.\nAmong 44 analysts, Micron has a median target price of $305 per share. That implies 4% upside from its current share price of $293.\nHere's what investors should know.\n1. Nvidia\nNvidia is well known for its best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs), chips used to speed up compute-intensive data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) training and inference. However, the company is truly formidable because of its full-stack strategy that spans adjacent hardware and software development tools.\nNvidia develops rack-scale systems that pair GPUs with CPUs and networking equipment, which lets the company optimize performance across the entire data center, while saving clients the trouble of integrating hardware from multiple suppliers.\nIn addition, Nvidia's CUDA software platform provides developers with an extensive suite of code libraries, frameworks, and pretrained models that simplify application development across numerous of use cases, from predictive analytics and content generation to conversational agents and autonomous machines.\nConsequently, while custom AI chips designed by rivals like Broadcom may be cheaper, Nvidia systems often have the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) when every expense is include. \"Our TCO is so good that even when the competitors' chips are free, it's not cheap enough,\" according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\nNvidia dominates the AI accelerator space today with more than 80% market share, and the company is likely to maintain its dominance for the foreseeable future because it offers customers the lowest TCO. Wall Street expects Nvidia's earnings to grow at 37% annually in the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 46 times earnings look attractive.\n2. Broadcom\nBroadcom is a key player in two parts of the AI supply chain: networking chips and custom accelerators. The company has 80% market share in high-speed Ethernet switching and routing chips, a market forecast to grow at 20% to 30% annually in the next few years, per JPMorgan Chase. Its latest Tomahawk 6 (switching) and Jericho 3 (routing) chips offer industry-leading performance.\nBroadcom is also the leading supplier of custom AI accelerators, also called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), with 70% to 80% market share. The company has five major ASIC customers: Alphabet's Google, Meta Platforms, TikTok parent ByteDance, OpenAI, and Anthropic. However, Broadcom has other prospective customers in the pipeline, including Apple, Arm Holdings, and xAI. The AI accelerator market is projected to expand at 29% annually through 2033, according to Grand View Research.\nBeyond semiconductors, Broadcom subsidiary VMware is a leader in virtualization software. Consultancy Gartner recently recognized the company as a leader in distributed hybrid infrastructure, a setup that uses virtualization to combine public and private clouds into one manageable system. The data center virtualization market is forecast to grow at 21% annually through 2033, according to Grand View.\nWall Street estimates Broadcom's adjusted earnings will grow at 36% annually during the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 51 times earnings look attractive.\n3. Micron Technology\nMicron develops memory and storage solutions for personal computers, mobile devices, data center servers, and automotive systems. The company sells DRAM (dynamic random access memory) products, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM) created by stacking DRAM chips, and NAND products.\nDRAM products offer fast, short-term memory for active applications, and NAND products provide slow, long-term memory for file storage. Both are important for artificial intelligence workloads; DRAM (especially HBM) products offer the bandwidth needed for training and inference, while NAND products provide the storage needed for datasets and AI models.\nImportantly, Micron is not the market leader in DRAM or NAND products, but the company is gaining market share in both categories and its primary competitors, Samsung and SK Hynix, are losing market share. Particularly important, Micron gained 10 percentage points of market share in HBM over the past year.\nWhy is Morgan Stanley so bullish? The analysts argue the ongoing AI buildout has led to the most severe DRAM and NAND shortage in the last three decades. That shortage is driving prices higher and Micron is well-positioned to benefit. Indeed, Wall Street expects Micron's earnings to grow at 48% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 28 times earnings look quite cheap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

{"article_id": "4f28239c894abe0d", "source": "yahoo", "headline": "7 Social Security Changes That Take Effect Today", "body": "", "content": "Nearly a quarter-century of annual surveys show that up to 90% of retirees rely on their monthly Social Security income to cover some portion of their expenses.\nSocial Security is a dynamic program, with changes made on an annual basis.\nSocial Security checks are seeing a historic increase, with meaningful changes also made for high earners, early filers, and workers with disabilities in 2026.\nFor most retirees, Social Security income is more than just a monthly check. It represents a financial foundation that many have admitted they'd struggle to make do without. According to 24 years of surveys from national pollster Gallup, 80% to 90% of retired respondents note relying on their Social Security income, in some capacity, to meet their expenses.\nOne of the factors responsible for making Social Security such a successful program in the 86 years since retired-worker benefits began being paid is that it's dynamic. Multiple facets of the program are updated annually, which can potentially benefit some or all recipients.\nAs we flip the calendar to 2026, seven significant Social Security changes take effect today.\n1. A historic cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) goes into effect\nNo change bears more importance for the more than 70 million people currently receiving a traditional Social Security benefit than the near-annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). This is the \"raise\" passed along to beneficiaries that attempts to account for the inflationary pressures they've contended with.\nHypothetically, if the cost of a large basket of goods and services regularly purchased by seniors increased by 3%, Social Security payouts would need to rise by the same percentage to avoid a loss of buying power. Social Security's COLA is a tool that helps beneficiaries combat the effects of inflation.\nOn Oct. 24, following a nine-day delay caused by the federal government shutdown, the Social Security Administration (SSA) announced a 2.8% COLA for 2026. The SSA estimates this 2.8% COLA will boost the average monthly retired-worker benefit by $56 to $2,071, and lift the average monthly payout for workers with disabilities by $44 to $1,630 in the new year.\nWhat makes this raise so special is that it marks the first time in 29 years that benefits have climbed at least 2.5% for five consecutive years.\nUnfortunately, a 9.7% year-over-year increase in Medicare's Part B premium for 2026, coupled with a still-robust inflation rate for shelter and medical care services (two spending categories that bear high importance for retirees), makes it likely that the purchasing power of a Social Security dollar will decline this year.\n2. High earners may be on the hook for a bigger tax bill\nSocial Security's annual changes aren't limited to current beneficiaries. One of this year's biggest changes takes aim at high-earning workers.\nAlthough Social Security has three sources of income, its primary funding source, responsible for over 91% of collected income in 2024, is the 12.4% payroll tax on earned income (wages and salary, but not investment income). In 2025, all earned income from $0.01 to $176,100 was subject to the payroll tax, with earnings above $176,100 exempted.\nIn 2026, the earnings tax cap (the $176,100 figure in 2025) is increasing to $184,500. For self-employed high earners who reach the cap, it means up to an additional $1,041.60 in payroll tax liability for the new year. Meanwhile, those employed by someone else can owe up to $520.80 extra.\nApproximately 6% of workers are expected to reach the earnings tax cap this year.\n3. The maximum monthly payout at full retirement age is climbing\nOn the other hand, a select group of retirees who earned a high average wage or salary throughout their lifetime will see the maximum monthly benefit at full retirement age jump in 2026.\nLast year, the largest possible monthly payment at full retirement age was $4,018, which was $196 more per month than in 2024. For 2026, high-earning retirees can receive up to $4,152 per month, representing a $134/month year-over-year jump.\nTo receive this maximum monthly payout at full retirement age -- which is something only around 2% of retirees achieve -- you'd need to:\nWait until full retirement age (67 for anyone born in or after 1960) to claim your retired-worker benefit.\nWork at least 35 years, since the SSA takes your 35 highest-earning, inflation-adjusted years into account when calculating your monthly payout.\nReach the taxable earnings cap in all 35 years the SSA uses in your calculation.\n4. Early filer withholding thresholds are increasing, yet again\nSocial Security's annual changes can be particularly meaningful for early filers (workers who began collecting their retirement benefit prior to reaching full retirement age).\nIn addition to a permanent monthly payout reduction for claiming benefits prior to reaching full retirement age, early filers may be subject to the retirement earnings test. The earnings test allows the SSA to withhold some or all of the Social Security income an early filer receives, depending on their income.\nFor instance, early filers who didn't reach full retirement age in 2025 had $1 in benefits withheld for every $2 in earned income above $23,400 ($1,950 per month). In 2026, withholding for early filers who won't reach full retirement age kicks in at $24,480 ($2,040 per month). In other words, early filers can generate $90/month more in income without being penalized.\nIt's a similar story for early filers who will reach their full retirement age in 2026. Last year, $1 in benefits was withheld for every $3 in earned income above $62,160 ($5,180 per month). In 2026, individuals in this category can earn $65,160 ($5,430 per month) before withholding begins.\nTake note that these income thresholds no longer apply once a beneficiary reaches their full retirement age.\n5. Substantial gainful activity limits for workers with disabilities are rising, too\nIn addition to early filers, the 7.14 million workers with disabilities who were receiving a monthly benefit, as of November 2025, may be impacted by changes made to the substantial gainful activity limits in 2026.\nIn 2025, non-blind workers with long-term disabilities were able to earn up to $1,620 per month without having their payout stopped by the SSA. This year, they'll be able to earn up to $1,690 each month, or $70 more than in 2025.\nThis increase is even larger, on a nominal-dollar basis, for blind workers with disabilities. Whereas these individuals could generate up to $2,700 in monthly earned income in 2025, they'll be allowed to bring home up to $2,830/month in the new year without their disabled-worker benefits ceasing.\n6. The bar to qualify for a Social Security benefit has modestly increased\nAnother Social Security change that affects future beneficiaries involves the bar they must clear to be eligible for a monthly payout.\nSocial Security benefits aren't a right -- most individuals obtain their coverage through employment. To receive a retired-worker benefit, 40 lifetime work credits are required, with a maximum of four credits that can be earned annually.\nThe silver lining is that the bar to earn these work credits is set relatively low. Last year, $1,810 in earned income equated to one lifetime work credit. If you earned $7,240 in wages or salary ($1,810 X 4), you maxed out your work credits for 2025.\nIn 2026, it'll take $1,890 in earned income ($80 more) to receive one work credit and $7,560 to collect all four credits (i.e., the maximum) for the year.\n7. Social Security recipients in The Mountain State may be able to keep more of their benefits\nLastly, more than 476,000 Social Security beneficiaries in West Virginia, based on SSA data from December 2023, have reason to smile.\nOn March 27, 2024, now-former Republican Governor Jim Justice of The Mountain State signed legislation to phase out the state-level taxation of Social Security benefits.\nSingle and married filers with adjusted gross incomes (AGIs) below $50,000 and $100,000, respectively, were already exempt from state-level taxation on their Social Security benefits. Beginning in the 2024 tax year, 35% of Social Security benefits were exempted from West Virginia's state income tax for AGIs above $50,000 (single filers) and $100,000 (couples filing jointly), respectively. In 2025, this exemption increased to 65%. Beginning today, 100% of Social Security income will be exempt from state-level taxation.\nThe $23,760 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income.\nOne easy trick could pay you as much as $23,760 more... each year!

Huffstutter and Julie Ingwersen\nCHICAGO, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture released details on Wednesday about how much row crop farmers will receive next year from a $12 billion aid program, but soybean growers say such payments fall short of helping those hurt by low crop prices and trade disputes.\nThe Farmer Bridge Assistance program is expected to distribute $11 billion in one-time payments to farmers, who will be paid on a per-acre rate if they planted one of the 19 commodity crops identified as being eligible for the program, USDA said in a statement on Wednesday.\nU.S. farmers produced massive corn and soybean harvests this fall amid a global glut of grain, and lost billions of dollars amid falling crop prices. Soybean farmers were particularly hard hit by the loss of soybean sales to China, by far the world's top buyer, when it turned to South American suppliers during stalled trade talks.\nWhile the aid is expected to help farmers prepare for the next planting season, growers and agricultural economists say the payments are a fraction of farm losses and will not rescue the sagging U.S. farm economy.\nThe highest per-acre payments will be paid to rice farmers, who could receive $132.89 an acre; cotton farmers, at $117.35 an acre; and oat farmers, at $81.75 an acre. Meanwhile, farmers are eligible for a payment of $44.36 per corn acre, $30.88 per soybean acre and $39.35 per wheat acre. The payments are calculated using 2025 planted acres, cost-of-production data, and market conditions, USDA said.\n“Due to significant trade losses this year, the payment rate for soybeans will likely not be enough for soybean farmers to keep their operations financially solvent as we move into the next planting season,” said Scott Metzger, an Ohio farmer and president of the American Soybean Association, a trade group that represents nearly a half-million soybean producers.\nSorghum growers are set to receive more than soybean growers at $48.11 per acre, and see the payments as a welcome help even as export demand has improved recently, said Tim Lust, chief executive officer of the National Sorghum Producers.\nOther crops that qualify include peanuts, sorghum, barley, canola, sunflower, lentils, peas, mustard, safflower, flax, large and small chickpeas, and sesame. The payments are expected to be received by February 28, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement.\nU.S. President Donald Trump initially unveiled the $12 billion aid package for American farmers on December 8, as farm groups and Republican farm-state lawmakers have sought the aid in part to support farmers with purchases of seeds, fertilizer and other expenses.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/usda-details-12-billion-farm-235456080.html", "published_at": "2025-12-31T23:54:56+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}
{"article_id": "d9506754c94c2ec8", "source": "yahoo", "headline": "Farmers can now learn how much aid they will get from the Trump administration", "body": "", "content": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Farmers are now learning how much aid they can expect to receive from a $12 billion package that President Donald Trump announced earlier this month.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture released the figures Wednesday for how much aid per acre farmers can plan on for each row crop. The details arrived after most farmers have already met with their bankers to arrange financing for next year's crops and placed orders for the seed and fertilizer they will need. But officials have promised that the payments should arrive by the end of February.\nSoybean farmers have been hit especially hard by Trump's trade war with China, which stopped buying any American crops after Trump announced his tariffs this spring. China is the world's largest buyer of soybeans. This aid package is expected to help farmers weather the trade disruptions until China buys more soybeans under an agreement announced in October and until provisions of Trump's massive budget bill take effect later this year.\nSoybean farmers will get $30.88 per acre while corn farmers will receive $44.36 per acre. Another crop hit hard when China stopped buying was sorghum, and those farmers will get $48.11 per acre. The amounts are based on a USDA formula on the cost of production.\nFarmers say they need more buyers for their crops\nBut farmers say the aid won't solve all their problems as they continue to deal with the soaring costs of fertilizer, seeds and labor that make it hard to turn a profit right now. Some agricultural trade groups have said they worry that thousands of farmers could go out of business, but others have said they believe most farmers have the financial resources and equity needed to survive.\nKentucky soybean farmer Caleb Ragland, who was president of the American Soybean Association until recently, said the aid is “a Band-Aid on a deep wound. We need competition and opportunities in the market to make our future brighter.”\nThe President of the National Corn Growers Association Jed Bower also urged the Trump administration to focus on cultivating additional uses for their crops. Farmers will benefit from having more buyers whether it is for ethanol and animal feed at home or for international markets.\n“Corn growers have been sounding the alarm about the fact that farmers have been faced with multiple consecutive years of low corn prices and high input costs,” Bower said. “While this financial assistance is helpful and welcomed, we urgently need the administration and Congress to develop markets in the United States and abroad that will provide growers with more long-term economic certainty.”\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that is the goal and promised to continue working to open new markets while strengthening the safety net for farmers.\nMinnesota Soybean Growers Association President Darin Johnson said the aid number for soybeans fell short of what farmers had been hoping for, so more help could be needed, though this package will help.\nMost farmers remain steadfast supporters of Trump even after the disruptions caused by the trade war. They generally support many of his other policies and believe they will get a better trade deal in the end.\nWhite House and farmers encouraged by China's purchases\nThese aid payments will add up to $11 billion for row crop farmers who raise corn, soybeans, wheat, sorghum and other crops. Another $1 billion has been set aside for specialty crops and sugar, but the administration hasn't released any details of aid for those crops.\nAfter Trump met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, the White House said Beijing had promised to buy at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of the calendar year, plus 25 million metric tons a year in each of the next three years. Officials have said China is on track to meet the 12 million metric ton goal by the end of February.\nAs of Dec. 18, China had bought about 6 million metric tons of soybeans, according to the latest USDA’s weekly report. Separately, the federal agency reported that China since then bought at least three more batches totaling 600,000 metric tons.\nBeijing has yet to confirm any commitment to buying 12 million metric tons of soybeans for this season, but the Chinese embassy in Washington said earlier this month that “agricultural trade cooperation between China and the United States is proceeding in an orderly manner.”\nHowever, the recent increase in international purchases is encouraging to farmers, said Tim Lust, CEO of the National Sorghum Producers, who has seen more than 1 million metric tons of sorghum purchased in just the past few weeks. Like soybeans, more than half of the sorghum crop is exported each year with China traditionally being the biggest buyer.\nThe aid payments will be capped at $155,000 per farmer or entity, and only farms that make less than $900,000 in adjusted gross income will be eligible. During the first Trump administration, a number of large farms found ways around the payment limits and collected millions.\nThe USDA says the average size of the 1.88 million farms nationwide was 466 acres last year, but many farmers are much larger than that as larger operations have continued to buy up neighboring farms over time.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/farmers-now-learn-much-aid-205709045.html", "published_at": "2025-12-31T20:57:09+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}
{"article_id": "038220e373670c18", "source": "yahoo", "headline": "Trump Is Promising That the U.S. Will Return to the Moon. Does That Really Make Little-Known SIDU Stock a Buy?", "body": "", "content": "Investor excitement around space stocks has been building rapidly as President Donald Trump renews his push for U.S. leadership in space and pledges a return to the Moon before the end of the decade. That rhetoric has helped lift the entire space technology sector, sending shares of both well-known names and obscure microcaps higher.\nOne of the beneficiaries of this shift has been Sidus Space (SIDU), a little-known microcap that has seen its shares soar as optimism around Trump’s space agenda spreads across the sector. Recent headlines around defense contracts and capital raises have only added fuel to the move. But beneath the excitement lies a critical question for investors: does a more aggressive U.S. push toward the Moon actually translate into meaningful financial upside for Sidus Space—or is the stock simply being swept higher by speculation and short-term momentum? Let’s take a closer look!\nValued at a market cap of $94.1 million, Sidus Space operates across the commercial space, aerospace, and defense sectors. The company acts as a space mission enabler, offering services that span satellite design, manufacturing, and data collection. Its flagship product, LizzieSat, is a 3D-printed, multi-mission satellite built for flexibility and cost efficiency, with the ability to integrate new technologies to support a wide range of mission needs. The company also provides AI-driven Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) through its Orlaith AI ecosystem, which features proprietary FeatherEdge and Cielo platforms for processing and delivering space-based data insights.\nShares of the innovative space and defense technology company have dropped 27% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. However, SIDU shares have spiked more than fourfold over the past month, largely driven by three key catalysts that I’ll outline below.\nWhy Sidus Space Stock Skyrocketed This Month\nOn Dec. 22, SIDU stock nearly doubled after the company announced it had secured a contract under the Missile Defense Agency’s (MDA) Scalable Homeland Innovative Enterprise Layered Defense (SHIELD) program. The SHIELD contract supports President Trump’s plan for the “Golden Dome” for America's missile defense system. The indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract has a ceiling value of $151 billion. Notably, securing a spot on the IDIQ makes Sidus Space eligible to compete for future task orders as the MDA defines work requirements, but it does not guarantee any revenue on its own.\n“This milestone reflects our ability to deliver integrated solutions across multiple domains and demonstrates the strength of our approach to building long-term capability within the defense sector,” said Carol Craig, founder and CEO of Sidus Space.\nEarlier, on Dec. 19, SIDU shares jumped more than 35% after President Trump signed an executive order titled “Ensuring American Space Superiority,” which formally calls for a U.S. return to the lunar surface by 2028, aligning with the final year of his second term. The directive represents an update to his first-term 2017 space policy, which had originally targeted 2024 for a human landing before facing delays.\nSidus Space took advantage of its stock surge by pricing two public offerings. The first offering closed last Wednesday, raising roughly $25 million in gross proceeds, while the second closed on Monday and generated about $16.2 million. Interestingly, SIDU shares sold off after the first offering was announced but rebounded once it closed, and the same pattern played out following the second offering. This suggests investors shifted their focus to the company’s long-term growth prospects, betting that the fresh capital will be used to fund future expansion. The company said it plans to deploy the new capital toward sales and marketing, operating expenses, product development, manufacturing expansion, working capital, and general corporate purposes.\nSuch capital raises are especially critical for companies generating only modest revenue while continuing to burn cash, and in SIDU’s case, the timing could hardly have been better. In the third quarter, the company’s revenue stood at $1.3 million, down 31% year-over-year (YoY). The revenue decline reflected a strategic pivot away from legacy services toward new commercial models. At the same time, its net loss widened 55% YoY to $6.0 million. The company held $12.7 million in cash as of Sept. 30, while cash burn totaled $14.1 million over the first nine months of the year, equating to roughly $4.7 million per quarter. However, following the recent capital raise, the company’s liquidity position appears solid.\nSpace Stocks Post Strong Year With Further Upside Likely Amid U.S. Lunar Mission Push\nSIDU’s stock gains have come amid a favorable backdrop for space technology companies. The sector has had a strong year, buoyed by rising excitement around a potential SpaceX IPO, increased launch activity, and President Trump’s executive order calling for a U.S. return to the Moon by 2028. Newly appointed NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said on CNBC last Friday that the U.S. will return to the Moon during President Trump’s second term. Isaacman told CNBC’s “Closing Bell Overtime” that Mr. Trump’s renewed commitment to lunar exploration is critical to unlocking what he called the “orbital economy.” “We want to have that opportunity to explore and realize the scientific, economic, and national security potential on the moon,” Isaacman said.\nIsaacman said lunar opportunities include building space-based data centers and infrastructure, along with the potential extraction of Helium-3, a rare gas embedded in the moon’s surface that could one day serve as a key fuel for fusion power. He added that once a “moon base” is established, NASA would look to invest in nuclear power and space-based nuclear propulsion to support further exploration. NASA is currently working with multiple contractors, including SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Boeing (BA), as part of its Artemis campaign, which is focused on returning to the Moon and laying the groundwork for future missions to Mars.\nMeanwhile, Sidus Space serves as a key subcontractor to Collins Aerospace on NASA’s $3.5 billion Exploration Extravehicular Activity Services (xEVAS) contract, helping develop next-generation spacesuits and hardware for the ISS and Artemis lunar missions. It also supports lunar exploration through other NASA programs such as the Intuitive Machines-led RACER lunar rover team. Earlier this month, Sidus Space announced it was serving as a subcontractor to MobLobSpace under a NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award focused on improving orbital debris monitoring. It’s also worth noting that this year, Sidus Space completed on-orbit operations of its advanced onboard edge computer, FeatherEdge GEN-2, integrated into the ongoing commissioning of LizzieSat-3.\nDoes the U.S. Lunar Mission Push Make SIDU Stock a Buy?\nUndoubtedly, the U.S. push to return to the Moon provides a positive backdrop for the entire space sector. However, it appears the key catalyst currently driving Sidus Space shares is the company’s inclusion on the SHIELD contract. In any case, I don’t view SIDU stock as a “Buy” at current levels. Buying the stock now would amount to chasing a rally, which is rarely a good idea, and the recent surge appears driven largely by speculation and short-squeeze dynamics rather than underlying fundamentals. That’s because neither a renewed commitment to lunar missions by the Trump administration nor inclusion on the SHIELD contract guarantees a direct financial impact.\nSidus Space has light coverage on Wall Street, with just one analyst following the stock and assigning it a “Strong Buy” rating. The analyst’s bullish stance is also reflected in SIDU stock’s $10 price target, which implies upside potential of more than 270%.\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
