They are all discussing how big the foetus is at various stages of pregnancy, using fruit and vegetables as a guide.\nDan from Edinburgh says that his baby, due in early January, was at one point the size of a grapefruit. Another father - Shaun from Gateshead - chimes in that his is cabbage-sized.\nAll six people - among them, a nurse, an electrician, a writer, a publicist, a physician's associate and a software developer - have travelled from across the country on a drizzly afternoon to take part in a social experiment.\nBBC Radio 4's Today programme plans to follow these families for five years, chronicling the ups and downs of looking after a young child in modern Britain.\nEarly childhood is an important stage of life in determining a child's long-term future, scientists say. But it's also a period that can get lost in our national politics, which so often seems to focus on the needs of the elderly and middle-aged.\nWes Streeting, the Health Secretary, says: \"Talk to the overwhelming majority of parents, good parents, they will take bullets for their children. I don't think that's reflected sufficiently in the state.\"\nAnd for many British parents raising a child can feel like a game of chance.\nAccess to childcare can be highly dependent on your postcode, campaigners say, and parental leave pay fluctuates wildly, depending on the generosity of employers, while others rely solely on statutory maternity and paternity leave pay.\nSo what effect does this so-called \"lottery\" of early years provision have, not only on the family but on the child and their future?\nGenerous employers vs statutory pay\nShaun, an electrician, is getting two weeks of paternity leave - the statutory minimum.\n\"It's not the best,\" he admits. \"And I found out the other day, if we had to go into hospital earlier for whatever reason, I would have to use holiday for that. [It] only starts when [the baby] is born.\"\nStill, he feels lucky. \"My work's been quite flexible.\"\nThe UK has a mixed record on maternity and paternity pay, explains Abby Jitendra, policy adviser at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank. Mothers get more time off compared with other European countries, but a relatively poor replacement for their wages, while fathers get one of the least generous deals in Europe, she argues.\nBut what really shines through is the sense of lottery. How much you're paid in your baby's first year is determined largely by your employer, she says - and this of course impacts how much time parents can afford to take off.\nThe state guarantees employed mothers a basic pay of 90% of their average weekly earnings for six weeks, and then a statutory minimum of £187.18 per week for the next 33 weeks (or 90% of their earnings, if that is lower). Employed fathers, meanwhile, receive that same statutory minimum for two weeks. Self-employed parents get a different benefit.\nBut certain employers - including some tech and financial services firms, and some highly unionised public sector employers - offer their staff much more. Some workers get six months off on full pay.\nThe income difference between those generous workplace policies and statutory provision is \"really night and day\", Ms Jitendra argues. It ultimately means that some parents are forced back to work much quicker than others, giving them less time with their children.\nIt is hard to pinpoint exactly what impact these policies have on a child's long-term future, says Emily Jones, an early years neuroscientist at Birkbeck, University of London.\nSome assume that a generous maternity or paternity leave policy benefits an infant, because it allows a parent to be at home for more time during their child's crucial first year of development. But Prof Jones says it is more complicated.\nWhat matters is that a baby has regular interaction with at least one \"stable attachment figure\", she says - it is not important whether that is a parent, or a nursery worker or childminder.\nWhat is true, she says, is that a generous parental leave policy can reduce stress in a household, which certainly benefits a child.\nWithout decent parental leave, she says, there is a risk that parents are forced to \"juggle\" work with childcare, or simply get by on a lower income.\n\"Those increases in stress, not being able to spend the time you have with [the] baby in a relaxed way - those are things that are going to be problematic.\"\nLow uptake of shared parental leave\nShaun and Miranda considered taking Shared Parental Leave (SPL), a state-funded scheme that allows parents to share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of state-funded pay - but they calculated that it wouldn't make financial sense for them.\nTake-up of shared parental leave has risen since it was introduced by the Coalition in 2015, but it remains low. Just 1% of mothers and 5% of fathers used it between 2015 and 2020, a government report from 2023 suggests.\nAmong those fathers who did not take shared parental leave, almost half (45%) were not even aware the scheme existed, the report found.\nCampaign group The Dad Shift, has argued that the scheme is \"failing working families\". According to the group's analysis of HMRC data, 95% of claims for state-funded SPL in 2024-25 were made by fathers or partners in the top half of earners.\nBut others argue that it should not be the responsibility of the state to ensure that everybody gets equal time off work to look after their child. Maxwell Marlow, director of public affairs at the Adam Smith Institute, a think tank, says there should be a \"baseline minimum\" maternity and paternity pay, but beyond that it should be left to individual workers to negotiate with their employers.\nAny attempt by the government to expand parental leave provision risks placing onerous demands on already-struggling businesses, he thinks.\nThe Department for Work and Pensions say they have launched a review into parental leave and pay \"to better support working families as part of our Plan for Change\".\nThe childcare 'postcode lottery'\nMiranda, a nurse, is already thinking about what happens when her maternity leave ends. Her own mother has saved up annual leave to use.\n\"Your mum's going to be very, very busy,\" Shaun laughs.\nWorking parents in England are now eligible for 30 hours of state-funded childcare per week during term-time, for children from the age of nine months to four.\nThe policy, which came fully into effect in September 2025, was initiated by the Conservatives and continued by Labour, and marked a \"step change\" in childcare provision, says Ms Jitendra.\nYet some families say they have fallen between the gaps.\nThat's because all adults in a household must be working and earn more than £10,158 but less than £100,000 per year to be eligible.\nOne father, David from London, whose wife was retraining to be an occupational therapist, told the BBC last year that he was devastated after realising they didn't qualify because she wasn't earning at the time.\n\"It seems to be a huge oversight,\" he said at the time.\nEven for those who do qualify, a place is not guaranteed as nursery provision varies so much.\nA report last year from Ofsted, the body that regulates and inspects early years education, found vast inequalities across different areas. For example, it identified Walsall in the West Midlands as a childcare \"desert\", with just 13.5 childcare places per 100 nursery-age children; while Richmond-upon-Thames in west London was named an \"oasis\", on account of its 39.8 places per 100 nursery-aged children. (This may sound low too but only 64% of children use formal childcare, and many only do so on certain days.)\nThis so-called postcode lottery is partly driven by money. Private nursery chains, which have become a bigger share of the childcare market in recent years, tend to open in more affluent areas where there is a greater profit incentive.\nBut the lottery is even more random than that. Even within postcodes, there's huge variability between nurseries based on training and experience of staff, argues Chris Pascal, a professor of early years education and the director of the Centre for Research in Early Childhood, a charity.\n\"It depends on [many things] - have they got people who love children, who enjoy their work, who have been professionally trained?\"\nA Department for Education spokesperson said they are investing £9.5bn into early years over 2026, part of an effort \"to back working parents\" by covering the costs of 30 hours childcare a week, saving families up to £7,500 per child per year.\nThey added: \"The latest data shows childcare capacity is continuing to grow, and our new school-based nurseries and government-funded childcare expansion are already playing a vital role in supporting families in more disadvantaged communities.\"\nBrain development and early socialisation\nSam Wass, a neuroscientist specialising in early years at the University of East London, says that during the first few years of a child's life, the learning capacity of an infant's brain \"far outstrips an adult's brain\".\nEarly socialisation is particularly important, he says. \"What babies need and what they learn from the best are simple, slow, repetitious, face-to-face interactions.\"\nSome experts think that the more support parents get - either from the state, or from their employer - the better their baby's brain develops.\nTake childcare. Prof Pascal argues that what a child crucially needs during their early years is interaction, both from adults and from other children - and that a high-quality nursery can be the ideal environment for this.\nThere, professionally trained staff can teach children how to play, explore, and negotiate conflicts with other children - all of which helps stimulate their brains.\n\"A quality nursery is astonishingly good in terms of advancing a child's life chances,\" she says.\nBut Prof Jones thinks the long-term impact of nursery on a child's development is more complicated. Before a child turns two, she says, they need a \"stable caregiver\" they can interact with.\nThey can get that at nursery but they can also find it at home, she says.\nIt's after a child is two that nursery becomes \"actively beneficial\". At that point, \"they start to interact with their peers and understand who other children are - that all becomes really important.\"\nBaby boxes and green spaces\nAnna and Dan, another couple taking part in the experiment, received a \"baby box\" in the post in the autumn - a cardboard box containing a digital thermometer, changing mat, mattress, health information, clothes, and baby books.\nThey live in Scotland, where every pregnant mother is entitled to one, as part of a policy introduced by the Holyrood government in 2017.\nAnna says it's a \"massive lifeline\". \"It really does provide everything you need for the first six months.\"\n\"We've heard about the box,\" Adam, from Staffordshire, says with a laugh. As he lives in England, he and his partner aren't eligible to receive one.\nIt's another of the other small differences that affect parents across the UK.\nThe benefits of the box aren't entirely clear. Research carried out at the University of Glasgow found that the introduction of the box brought no change to infant hospital admissions, though it did lead to a small increase in breastfeeding and a small decrease in tobacco exposure (perhaps because of health information included in the box on those topics).\nThe \"absolute effects were small\", the researchers concluded.\nThen there is the varying availability - and quality - of parks, playgrounds, and libraries depending on where you live.\nA report last year by charity, Fields in Trust, looked at how many people in Britain live within a 10-minute walk of an accessible green space (like a public park or an open sports field).\nIn big cities such as London, Manchester, and Liverpool, more than 95% of people have this benefit, the report found. But in other places - including East Lindsey in Lincolnshire - fewer than 75% do.\nProf Pascal says these public places are vital. \"For young children, play is the stuff of life. This is how they operate, learn, interact.\n\"For cognitive development, brain development, play is where the child is really pushing the boundaries.\"\nUltimately, parenting in modern Britain remains unpredictable. Small, seemingly unimportant details - like postcode, or employment status - can have big effects on the amount of help a parent receives during the early years of their child's life.\nProf Pascal wants to see a change of thinking in the UK, so it's no longer left to chance. \"Young children aren't just an individual or a family responsibility - they're a social and civic political responsibility,\" she argues.\nBut others say that big state handouts to parents end up placing a huge burden on the taxpayer - one that in their view the UK can't afford.\nBack at the children's centre, the soon-to-be parents are aware of the unpredictable nature of parenting.\n\"We can have all the theories in the world about what kind of parents we're going to be, says Anna. \"But it's going to depend on what kind of kid we get.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

It's for Amanda.\"\nAmanda had gone missing after a night out in her hometown of Hamilton in May 1992. Her body was found on waste ground the next day.\nBy any standards, the murder of the 19-year-old drama student had been exceptionally brutal.\nHer numerous injuries included a bite on her breast which the defence agreed had been inflicted by Auld.\nWhen the jury at the High Court in Glasgow announced the not proven verdict, Joe and Kate had no idea what it meant.\nThey listened in astonishment as the judge told Francis Auld he had been acquitted and was free to go.\nAfterwards, in a side room, lawyers explained that in the eyes of the law, not proven was exactly the same as not guilty. Auld had been cleared and could never be tried again.\nKate fainted.\nShe was carried from the building on a stretcher and taken to hospital.\nJoe said that throughout the case the police and prosecution had assured the couple that they had a very strong case and expected to get a guilty verdict.\n\"So when it was not proven, you were like, what exactly does that mean? There's something wrong here.\"\n\"It was the fear of knowing that the person who was responsible, in my eyes, was still out there and capable of doing it again,\" said Kate.\nA common interpretation of not proven was that the jury suspected the accused was guilty, but felt the prosecution had failed to prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt.\nGood luck finding that in a law book. As Joe and Kate were to discover, there was no written legal definition of not proven.\nOver the years, whenever juries asked, all judges could tell them was that it was a verdict of acquittal, just like not guilty.\nResearch has also shown that some people thought - incorrectly - that the accused could be tried again if the verdict was not proven.\nThat has been allowed in exceptional circumstances since 2011 under double jeopardy legislation, but the method of acquittal plays no part in that process.\nWithin weeks of the verdict in November 1992, Joe and Kate had set up a table in a street in Hamilton, gathering tens of thousands of signatures for a petition calling for not proven to go.\nJoe explained: \"I've never understood why you can have two verdicts which mean exactly the same thing.\n\"The only difference in law between not proven and not guilty is spelling.\n\"That's it. Why do we need them? Either you're guilty or not guilty.\"\nHamilton's Labour MP George Robertson believed some juries were using not proven as a \"cop out\" and put forward a private members' bill at Westminster proposing abolition.\nHe failed to win the backing of the then Conservative government and not proven survived.\nThe Duffys regarded the bill's failure as a stumbling block rather than a knockout blow. They set up a charity to help other families bereaved by murder, culpable homicide and suicide.\nThe beginning of the end\nTen years ago they established a counselling facility in Hamilton called the Manda Centre, the family's nickname for Amanda.\nIt was a case in 2015 that finally signalled the beginning of the end for not proven.\nA jury used it when they cleared a man accused of raping a student at St Andrews University.\nThe victim, known as Miss M, sued Stephen Coxen for damages in a civil court and won. The sheriff accepted she had been raped by Coxen.\nIt was said to be the first civil damages action for rape following an unsuccessful criminal prosecution in almost a century.\nThe outcome would have struck a chord with the Duffys. In 1995, Joe and Kate had sued Frances Auld over Amanda's death and won damages - which were never paid.\nA new campaign for abolition, led by Miss M and backed by Rape Crisis Scotland, argued that not proven was used disproportionately in sexual offence cases.\nThey said it offered juries \"an easy out\" and contributed to \"guilty people\" walking free.\nTheir case won support from leading politicians, including Nicola Sturgeon, who was first minister at the time.\nIn 2022, the SNP administration at Holyrood proposed a raft of legal reforms, including the removal of not proven.\nControversy over the verdict dates back to the mid-19th Century and the arguments for and against have changed very little over the years.\nCritics said it was confusing for juries and the public, failed to provide closure for alleged victims, and stigmatized the person on trial by appearing not to clear them completely.\nSupporters of the verdict argued that it was an important safeguard against wrongful convictions.\nScotland's top lawyers - the Faculty of Advocates - put it this way: \"The not proven verdict may be a safety valve for jurors who have not reached the threshold for conviction but reject the impossibility of guilt.\"\nBut this time, abolition had cross-party support and not proven's days were numbered.\nThe Scottish government's bill was passed by MSPs September this year, with Miss M and the Duffys watching from the public gallery at the Scottish Parliament.\nIn what was portrayed as a counter-balance, the legislation brought about another crucial change.\nScottish juries have 15 members. Until now, a guilty verdict could be returned through a simple majority - eight votes out of 15.\nFrom today, a two-thirds majority will be required. At least 10 out of 15 jurors will have to support a conviction.\nThe Scottish government said there was clear evidence that jurors were more likely to convict if they only had a choice of guilty or not guilty, and the change would ensure the system was fair and balanced.\nProsecutors at the Crown Office and campaigners at Rape Crisis Scotland fear the change will make it harder to get convictions.\nThe Law Society of Scotland would have preferred the unanimity or near-unanimity required by the jury system in England and Wales.\nIt could be years before the consequences of all of this become clear.\nIn 2016, prosecutors sought permission to put Francis Auld on trial for a second time over Amanda's murder, using the new double jeopardy law.\nTheir application was turned down by the courts. Auld died from cancer in 2017.\n\"The grief part, you learn to live with it,\" said Kate. \"You learn to live your life in a different way.\"\nThe couple paid tribute to Miss M and the part she played in bringing about the end of not proven.\n\"I take my hat off to her because she's really put herself out there,\" said Joe.\n\"There have been an awful lot of false dawns along the way but we've never, never given up.\n\"So for anybody who wants to campaign for something to be changed, don't stop, keep going for it.\n\"It might have taken us 33 years but you know something - we finally got there.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze8elpzz40o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-01T08:16:05+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

A serviceman standing next to the wreckage claims it is a Ukrainian Chaklun drone.\nThe BBC hasn't been able to verify the footage, and it is not possible to locate where it was shot.\nRussia would review its position on the ongoing peace negotiations as a result of the alleged incident, the Kremlin said.\nHowever, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, on Wednesday described the Russian claims as a \"deliberate distraction\" and an attempt to derail the peace process.\nIn his 20-minute address to the nation, Zelensky said that Ukraine did not want peace \"at any cost\", adding that \"we want the end of the war – not the end of Ukraine\".\nHe said that a Ukrainian withdrawal from the eastern Donbas region means \"everything will be over\", a reference to Russia's maximalist demand that Moscow secure full control of the industrial area in any peace agreement.\nMoscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.\nIts fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas.\nIn the address, Zelensky thanked leaders that have supported Ukraine, but said that \"intentions must become security guarantees, and therefore - be ratified\".\nFollowing talks between Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida earlier this week, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear.\n\"Signatures under weak agreements only fuel war,\" Zelensky said in his address. \"Either the world stops Russia's war, or Russia drags the world into its war.\"\nBy comparison, Putin's New Year address was much shorter.\nAddressing the war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a \"special military operation\", Putin said: \"We strive to bring joy and warmth through our care for those in need of support and, of course, to stand by our heroes – the participants in the special military operation – in both word and deed.\"\nSeparately, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year message to praise the \"invincible alliance\" between Pyongyang and Moscow, while praising soldiers who are fighting in \"alien lands\".\nNorth Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia in its invasion, along with missiles and long-range weapons, South Korean officials have said.\nAt least 600 of those soldiers have died, according to South Korean estimates.\nZelensky has expressed a desire for peace negotiations to resume and accelerate this month with the involvement of both US and European officials.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said European states and allies who are due to meet in Paris on 6 January \"will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European continent\".\nOn Wednesday, Trump's advisers held talks with Zelensky and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany about ending the war in Ukraine.\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff said they discussed \"strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart\".\nBut any deal will ultimately need Russian buy-in, which does not seem forthcoming - and which the alleged drone incident over Putin's residence may have pushed further into the distance.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddg7100ym2o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-01T05:22:01+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

They travelled over 807 miles (1,300km) of ocean before reaching the island of South Georgia.\nLeaving three of the men behind, Shackleton, Frank Worsley and Tom Crean trekked across the island for three days until they reached Stromness whaling station.\nAlison said the men made it to the villa in a dishevelled state.\nShe said: \"No-one recognised them, they must've looked terrifying.\n\"They knocked on the door of the villa and famously the whaling manager opened the door and said, 'who the hell are you?'\n\"Shackleton allegedly said: 'My name is Shackleton'.\"\nIt was the men's first contact with the outside world for 17 months.\nShackleton, Worsley and Crean were invited in to the villa where they had a hot meal and a bath, before immediately starting the rescue of the rest of their crew with the help of the whalers.\nAlison said: \"That's a really important part of The Endurance story and it effectively is the next chapter on from the sinking of the vessel.\"\nIn the coming weeks, digital specialists will go to South Georgia to scan the structure.\nAlison said: \"They're going to capture everything that lets us decide, at some point, how we're going to make this accessible to people.\n\"It will definitely be available on our website, for example.\n\"But we might also want to create a version where people can put a headset on and actually experience walking in to the room as it would've been in 1916.\"\nAlison said that \"heritage shouldn't be a privilege.\"\nShe said: \"You don't want it to just be something that inspires the people that can afford to come to an island.\n\"So many people are really fascinated by the story of Shackleton and the Endurance.\n\"It would be great to be able to tell everyone around the world who is keen on this story, this chapter.\n\"The most effective way to do that is to let them experience it for themselves through a digital version.\"\nThis season, 100 ships are expected to visit South Georgia, bringing around 18,000 visitors.\nShetlander Helen Balfour is the assistant curator at the South Georgia Museum in Grytviken, one of the island's former whaling stations.\nShe said she sees a lot of people interested in Shackleton at the museum.\n\"People are interested in the wildlife, but actually there's a lot of people who want to come to South Georgia to pay their respects to him.\"\nShackleton died on board his ship, Quest, in 1922 and was buried in Grytviken.\nHelen said: \"People want to come to toast 'The Boss' and it's something that a lot of the ships will make sure they schedule in to their time in South Georgia.\n\"I think people are really inspired by his leadership and his ability to get through anything.\n\"I think people are really intrigued by his expeditions and how he managed to keep going in the face of adversity.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm212zexpypo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-01T08:10:16+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

What's unusual is that nearly all belonged to women.\nThe new finds add to growing evidence that the burial ground was part of an early female religious community.\nFor the last four years, archaeologists have been excavating the site in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, close to the end of the runway at Cardiff airport.\nThe skeletons are buried in shallow graves cut into the limestone bedrock. While their bones and teeth show they lived hard lives, objects found amongst the graves suggest wealth and luxury.\nThe team have been scratching their heads trying to work out who these women were.\nNow the latest dig has provided a major clue: the outline of what could possibly be a small building.\n\"It's producing fragments of building stone, so it might be structural. We might be thinking of a small shrine or a chapel,\" says Dr Andy Seaman, from Cardiff University, who is leading the dig.\n\"I do think that we have a site which may be an early religious community.\"\nThe potential building is located in the centre of the cemetery and graves are clustered around it. It seems that people wanted to be buried as close to this feature as possible.\nSo close in fact, says Cardiff University archaeologist Tudur Davies, that some of these graves have several people in them.\n\"It's a highly desired location for people to be buried in,\" he says.\n\"Sometimes two, three, four individuals have been buried on the same spot, again and again. There doesn't appear to be as much of a taboo over putting bodies in the same place and just moving those still there to one side.\"\nArtefacts found at the site are revealing more about the people buried here.\nThe objects have been taken to Cardiff University's lab. Conservator Clare Emerson is painstakingly removing the dirt of the dig from an ornate copper brooch.\n\"We'd have to do some more analysis, but it's probably bronze,\" she says. \"Also we think it was possibly gilded, which would be a coating of gold over the top.\"\nThe ends, she explains, were covered in green enamel.\n\"This would have been a very decorative brooch. I think it's a very special find for the site.\"\nAlongside this piece of medieval bling, the team have also unearthed a pin made from bone with a detailed pattern and a comb intricately carved from antler.\nAnd there are some exquisite, multicoloured glass beads. Measuring about 3mm across, each one is a miniature delight. They were possibly stitched onto clothing or attached to a piece of jewellery.\nBut the domestic items found at the site tell us a lot too.\n\"We have a quern stone for grinding flour for bread. We've got pottery and glass for eating and drinking\" says Dr Andy Seaman.\n\"It's clearly not just a place for the dead. There's a living community here as well.\"\nHe thinks that the community was enclosed, living right next door to the cemetery, separated from the rest of society.\nThe pieces of this medieval puzzle are starting to come together. But there are still some questions.\nThe remains of a few men have been found - who were they? And some children too - were they related to any of the women?\nAnd while most of the people at the cemetery were buried with great care, two women were tossed in a ditch - one with her hands and feet tied. What had they done to deserve that?\nThe team are now trying to work out if this could be an example of very early Christianity.\n\"It's a period where the history is not yet written,\" says Dr Seaman.\n\"We don't really understand early church sites... how they functioned, what they looked like, how they were organised.\n\"We know that very well from later periods, but in this very formative period of history, it's not very well understood. So it's a really exciting opportunity.\"\nThe archaeologists will continue their excavations later this year.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd65wp8z9zo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-01T00:34:29+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

That is around half of the number of births recorded a decade ago, when China started to ease its rules on how many children people could have.\nStill, the tax on contraceptives, including condoms, birth control pills and devices, has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates, as well as ridicule. Some people point out that it would take a lot more than pricey condoms to persuade them to have children.\nAs one retailer urged shoppers to stock up ahead of the price hike, a social media user joked: \"I'll buy a lifetime's worth of condoms now.\"\nPeople can tell the difference between the price of a condom and that of raising a child, wrote another.\nChina is one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing. Costs are pushed up by school fees in a highly competitive academic environment, and the challenge women have juggling work and parenting, the study said.\nThe economic slowdown, partly brought on by a property crisis that has hit savings, has left families, and especially young people, feeling uncertain or less confident about their future.\n\"I have one child, and I don't want any more,\" says 36-year-old Daniel Luo, who lives in the eastern province of Henan.\n\"It's like when subway fares increase. When they go up by a yuan or two, people who take the subway don't change their habits. You still have to take the subway, right?\"\nHe says he is not concerned by the price hike. \"A box of condoms might cost an extra five yuan, maybe 10, at most 20. Over a year, that's just a few hundred yuan, completely affordable.\"\nBut cost might be a problem for others, and that's what worries Rosy Zhao, who lives in the city of Xi'an in central China.\nShe says making contraception, which is a necessity, more expensive could mean students or those struggling financially \"take a risk\".\nThat would be the policy's \"most dangerous potential outcome\", she added.\nObservers appear divided on the aim of the tax overhaul. The idea that a tax hike on condoms will impact birth rates is \"overthinking it\", says demographer Yi Fuxian from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nHe believes Beijing is keen to collect taxes \"wherever it can\" as it battles a housing market slump and growing national debt.\nAt nearly $1tn (£742bn), China's VAT revenue made up close to 40% of the country's tax collection last year.\nThe move to tax condoms is \"symbolic\" and reflects Beijing's attempts to encourage people to lift China's \"strikingly low\" fertility numbers, said Henrietta Levin from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nWhat is also hampering efforts, she adds, is that a lot of the policies and subsidies will have to be implemented by indebted provincial governments - and it's unclear if they can spare sufficient resources.\nChina's approach to urging people to have children also risks backfiring if people feel the government is being \"too intrusive\" about what is deeply personal choice, she said.\nRecently there have been media reports that women in some provinces have received calls from local officials asking about their menstrual cycles and plans to have children. The local health bureau in Yunnan province said such data was needed to identify expectant mothers.\nBut this has not helped the government's image, Ms Levin said. \"The [Communist] party can't help but insert itself into every decision that it cares about. So it ends up being its own worst enemy in some ways.\"\nObservers and women themselves say the country's male-dominated leadership fails to understand the social changes underpinning these broader shifts, which are not exclusive to China.\nCountries in the West and even those in the region, such as South Korea and Japan, have been struggling to lift birth rates as their population ages.\nPart of the reason is the burden of childcare, which disproportionately falls on women, research shows. But there are also other shifts, such as a decline in marriage and even dating.\nChina's measures miss the real problem: the way young people interact today, which increasingly avoids genuine human connections, Mr Luo from Henan said.\nHe points to rising sales of sex toys in China, which he believes is a sign that \"people are just satisfying themselves\" because \"interacting with another person has become more of a burden\".\nBeing online is easier and more comforting, he says, as \"the pressure is real\".\n\"Young people today deal with way more stress from society than people did 20 years ago. Sure, materially they're better off, but the expectations placed on them are much higher. Everyone's just exhausted.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxpk7r8w9yo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2025-12-31T23:07:11+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

This household would see a £3 rise in its annual bill from £1,755 to £1,758.\nHowever, the amount used varies significantly between households, so the best way to calculate the change is to work out the percentage change from your own usual annual bill.\nStanding charges - the fixed costs that cover the cost of running the network as well as government levies - will rise by 2% for electricity and 3% for gas, driving the overall increase.\nElectricity unit rates are rising, offset by a slight fall in gas rates, meaning that heavy users of electricity will see the biggest impact.\nThe price cap affects England, Wales and Scotland, as the sector in Northern Ireland is regulated separately.\nOfgem says people can often save money by moving to a fixed tariff. That sets the unit price for a certain period of time, so anyone already on a fixed deal will not see a change now.\nEmily Seymour, energy editor at consumer group Which?, said there were several deals on the market at prices lower than the price cap.\n\"As a rule of thumb, we'd recommend looking for deals cheaper than the current price cap, not longer than 12 months and without significant exit fees,\" she said.\nFor many households, the heating will be on for longer as we enter January and February, with snow and ice warnings in place for some areas.\nSome vulnerable households in certain areas of England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving cold weather payments, worth £25 a week, if the average temperature in a local area is recorded as, or forecast to be, 0C or below for seven days in a row.\nHouseholds can check their eligibility via a government online service. A separate winter heating payment operates in Scotland.\nThe £150 Warm Home Discount has been extended by the government to apply to more lower income households.\nSimon Francis, from the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said more needed to be done to help those who were struggling following the latest, small price increase.\n\"This is a case of every little hurts... we need to see much lower bills but also measures to keep people's homes warmer every winter.\"\nJames Jones and his wife Christine, like millions of other pensioners, have seen their winter fuel payment reinstated following a government U-turn on restricting the allowance.\n\"Obviously we've got it for the cold months. We've got the central heating on more. It's made a big difference. You know it's coming, so it's your standby,\" said Mr Jones.\nBut the Warrington couple are still cutting back on luxuries to cover bills.\n\"We get a rise on our pension but it gets taken off you by food, petrol and everything else going up all the time so really you don't benefit,\" he said.\nThere is some hope on the horizon in spring, though. In the Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said some levies placed on energy bills would go, lowering bills for millions of households by £150 a year from April.\nThat included cutting a scheme that was designed to tackle fuel poverty and help reduce carbon emissions, as well as shifting some costs onto general taxation.\nPeople on fixed deals in April would still benefit from the changes, the government has confirmed.\nHowever, about £30 will be knocked off those annual savings from April to pay for maintaining gas networks and strengthening the electricity transmission network.\nThere are also signs of lower wholesale costs, paid by suppliers.\nAnalysts at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight predict an 8% drop in the price cap in April - the equivalent of a fall of £138 to £1,620 a year for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzy5488qqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-01T00:03:14+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Bulgaria has held seven elections in the past four years - an eighth looks likely early next year.\n\"I don't want the euro, and I don't like the way it has been imposed on us,\" Todor, 50, a small business owner in the central town of Gabrovo, at the foot of the Balkan mountains, told the BBC.\n\"If there were a referendum, I reckon 70% of the people would vote against it.\"\nA referendum on euro adoption was proposed by President Rumen Radev but rejected by the outgoing government.\nTodor's business, producing coloured plastics for the domestic market, had a bad year because of high inflation, he said, and a fall in sales fuelled, he believed, by fear of the euro.\nOgnian Enev, 60, who owns a tea shop in central Sofia, was more enthusiastic. \"On the whole, it's a good thing. It's just a technical change. It doesn't bother me,\" he told the BBC.\nIn any case, he pointed out, people who bought flats or cars until now have got used to prices marked in euros.

From 1 February, it will no longer be permitted to pay in lev.\nHe hopes joining the single currency will be good for trade - many of his flavoured and fruit teas come from sellers in the eurozone, while the more expensive, high-end teas are imported direct from China and Japan.\nSince August 2025, all shops in Bulgaria have been required by law to display prices in both currencies.\nConveniently, €1 is worth about two lev (1.95583 to be exact). In response to public fears that prices will be rounded up, elaborate watchdogs have been created, to protect consumers. And some prices have been rounded down: the cost of public transport in the capital Sofia is due to fall slightly.\nThe design on the reverse side of the new eurocoins was chosen to overcome worries that Bulgaria is losing its sovereignty.

It will be no different if I'm playing and bowling.\n\"You always have a chance when guys are coming after you - it does bring you into the game a little bit more. If that presents out there, no issues.\"\nThe SCG traditionally assists slow bowlers - three of the four leading Test wicket-takers there are Australia spinners Shane Warne, Stuart MacGill and Lyon.\nBut Murphy's inclusion on Sunday (23:30 GMT on Saturday) is not guaranteed because of a mixed weather forecast and the limited impact spin has had in this Ashes series.\nOnly nine wickets have fallen to spin in four games, meaning this series is on course to have the fewest wickets taken by spinners in an Ashes series of at least four Tests, beating the 21 of England's 3-1 victory in Australia in 2010-11. This series will also comfortably have the fewest combined overs of spin bowled in an Ashes series.\nMurphy has taken 22 wickets in his seven Tests, though is yet to play at home.\n\"I still think there's a role to play for spin,\" said Murphy. \"You're not going to be thrown the ball and your role is to take wickets, it might be to play a holding role so the fast bowlers can have a break and then come back.\"\nEx-Australia batter Martyn in coma with meningitis\n- Published31 December 2025\nWe feel closer to him in Australia - Josh Baker's parents on dealing with loss\n- Published31 December 2025\nThrough a combination of green pitches and a Kookaburra ball offering greater assistance to seamers, spin has played a diminished role in Tests in Australia over the past decade.\nAustralia's number one spinner Lyon has seen the number of overs he has bowled in home series gradually fall.\nEngland won the fourth Test in Melbourne inside two days to cut the series deficit to 3-1. The Melbourne Cricket Ground pitch had 10mm of grass, meaning Australia did not play a spinner and England's Will Jacks did not bowl.\nOnly in the third Test in Adelaide, when Jacks and Lyon shared eight wickets, has spin played a prominent part.\n\"You've got to find ways to still be effective out there and still be able to play a role for what the team needs,\" added Murphy.\nAustralia were able to train at the SCG on New Year's Day, after England's earlier session was hit by rain.\nEngland's session was optional, and the only players in attendance who featured in Melbourne were captain Ben Stokes, Joe Root and Zak Crawley. Others spent time in the city with their families.\nThe tourists will make at least one change from the team that won in Melbourne, after seamer Gus Atkinson was ruled out with a hamstring injury.

His last game was on 2 October, almost three months ago.\nUnfortunately for Elliott he cannot join another team in January because he played for Liverpool in August - so he either needs to try to break into the Villa team or go back to Anfield and try to play there.\nYoane Wissa\nIt might seem strange to put a striker who cost £55m last summer on this list, but Yoane Wissa could do with a big 2026.\nAn injury on international duty for DR Congo ruled Wissa out until making his Newcastle debut on 6 December.\nBut the 29-year-old seems to be making up for lost time - and has scored in his first two Toon starts.\nEx-Brentford man Wissa had never played in Europe before this season, so will really want to prove himself at the top level now that he is back.\nIgor Thiago\nCould Brentford striker Igor Thiago play himself into Brazil's World Cup squad?\nThe 24-year-old has never won a cap at any age level, or even been in a senior squad, but he has 11 Premier League goals - only behind Erling Haaland.\nIf he ends up hitting 20, could Carlo Ancelotti ignore him? And could the Bees keep him?\nClaudio Braga\nUncapped Portuguese forward Claudio Braga has been one of the key attacking players in Hearts' remarkable challenge for the Scottish Premiership table.\nThe 26-year-old, a summer signing from Norwegian second-tier side Aalesunds, has scored eight goals in the league so far.\nHe had never played in a top flight before this season.

The INGOs said that could put them at risk.\nThe move was condemned by 10 countries, which said the rules would have a severe impact on access to essential services.\nIn a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the UK, France, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland said INGOs were integral to the humanitarian response in Gaza and that any attempt to stem their ability to operate was \"unacceptable\".\n\"Without them, it will be impossible to meet all urgent needs at the scale required,\" they warned.\nThe European Union's humanitarian chief, Hadja Lahbib, said: \"Israel's plans to block INGOs in Gaza means blocking life-saving aid.\"\nInternational humanitarian law \"leaves no room for doubt: aid must reach those in need,\" she added.\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk called the INGO suspensions \"outrageous\" and \"arbitrary\", and said they made \"an already intolerable situation even worse for the people of Gaza\".\nThe Humanitarian Country Team of the Occupied Palestinian Territory - a forum that brings together UN agencies and more than 200 local and international NGOs - urged the Israeli authorities to reconsider the registration decisions.\nIt has said INGOs run or support most of Gaza's field hospitals and primary healthcare centres, emergency shelter responses, water and sanitation services, nutrition stabilisation centres for children with acute malnutrition, and critical mine action activities.\nIsrael's ministry of diaspora affairs, which oversees registration applications, said the new measures would not affect the flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza.\nIt said aid continued to be delivered through \"approved and vetted channels\", including UN agencies, bilateral partners, and humanitarian organisations.\nIsraeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings and co-ordinates aid deliveries, meanwhile said the INGOs facing suspension \"did not bring aid into Gaza throughout the current ceasefire\", which began 11 weeks ago. It added that \"even in the past their combined contribution amounted to only about 1% of the total aid volume\".\nThe diaspora affairs ministry said the primary reason INGOs had their licences revoked was \"the refusal to provide complete and verifiable information regarding their employees,\" which it said was critical to preventing \"the infiltration of terrorist operatives into humanitarian structures\".\nFewer than 15% of the INGOs providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza were found to be in violation of the new regulatory framework, it added.\nThat framework includes several grounds for rejection, including:\n- Denying the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state\n- Denying the Holocaust or the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023\n- Supporting an armed struggle against Israel by an enemy state or terrorist organisation\n- Promoting \"delegitimisation campaigns\" against Israel\n- Calling for a boycott of Israel or committing to participate in one\n- Supporting the prosecution of Israeli security forces in foreign or international courts\nThe ministry of diaspora affairs also alleged that Israeli investigations had \"determined that individuals affiliated with [Médecins Sans Frontières] were linked to terrorist organisations, including the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas\", without providing any evidence.\n\"Despite repeated requests, the organisation failed to provide full disclosure regarding the identities and roles of these individuals,\" it said.\nMSF said it took such allegations extremely seriously and that it would \"never knowingly employ people engaging in military activity\".\n\"Any employee who engages in military activity would pose a danger to our staff and our patients. Publicly making such claims without substantiated evidence puts humanitarian staff at risk and undermines life-saving medical work,\" it added.\nMSF also warned that deregistration by Israeli authorities would effectively block it from operating in Gaza, \"where we support one in five hospital beds and one in three births, cutting off life-saving medical assistance for hundreds of thousands of people\".\nNorwegian Refugee Council spokeswoman Shaina Low told NPR that it would no longer be able to bring foreign aid workers into Gaza if it was deregistered, but that its 200 local staff would continue to support communities as best as they could.\nMs Low said NRC had tried to explain to the Israeli authorities why it could not provide them with lists of their Palestinian staff members.\n\"We've seen that hundreds of aid workers were killed over the last two years. And so, for us, it is a safety concern for our staff. And acknowledging who they are - it puts them at risk. Because we've seen that aid workers are just as unprotected, and at times, have been targeted by Israeli authorities,\" she said.\nShe also said that the NRC and other INGOs were prevented by data protection laws from complying with an Israeli demand to share details about the funding they received from the EU and EU member states.\n\"The number one thing that we're concerned about is the entry of aid,\" she added. \"We continue to call for Israel to lift these restrictions, to open all of the crossings to allow much more aid to enter than the current rate.\"\nIsrael says it is meeting its obligations in facilitating an increase in aid deliveries.\nOn 19 December, UN-backed food security experts said there had been improvements in nutrition and food supplies in Gaza since the ceasefire began, but that 100,000 people still experienced \"catastrophic conditions\" last month.\nOther INGOs to be suspended include CARE, Medico International, and Medical Aid for Palestinians.\nInternational Rescue Committee said it was in touch with relevant authorities and seeking a way to sustain the delivery of life-saving aid.\nBushra Khalidi, Oxfam's policy lead, meanwhile said Cogat's figures on aid deliveries by the affected INGOs were misleading because \"humanitarian impact is not measured by percentages\".\n\"We are not simply aid volume contributors; we are core implementers. The UN relies on our staff, our partners, our technical expertise, our logistics, and our community networks to deliver assistance,\" she explained.\nThe Humanitarian Country Team of the Occupied Palestinian Territory - a forum that brings together UN agencies and more than 200 local and international NGOs - urged the Israeli authorities to reconsider the registration decisions.\nEarlier this month, it complained that the new registration system relied on \"vague, arbitrary, and highly politicised criteria and imposes requirements that humanitarian organisations cannot meet without violating international legal obligations or compromising core humanitarian principles\".\nIn a statement, Israel's Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Amichai Chikli, said: \"The message is clear: humanitarian assistance is welcome - the exploitation of humanitarian frameworks for terrorism is not.\"\nThe war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1evp7weyv2o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2025-12-31T17:10:29+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

She was dubbed an \"uncompromising leader\" after refusing to participate in a controversial election under military ruler General Hussain Muhammad Ershad in the 1980s.\nFor several years, along with her bitter political rival Sheikh Hasina, she fought for democracy and against military dictatorship, enduring arrests.\nThere was talk among Bangladesh's rulers at the time to keep the two \"battling begums\" - Zia and Hasina - out of politics in what was then known as the \"minus two formula\".\nBut Zia eventually became prime minister, first in 1991 then again in 2001.\nDuring the time of the military-backed caretaker government in 2007, she was kept under detention.\nIn the last 16 years, under Hasnina's Awami League government, Zia emerged as the most prominent symbol of resistance to Hasina's rule which many saw as increasingly autocratic.\nZia's resilience drew admiration from her supporters, who say that despite various personal and political setbacks, years in opposition and convictions under Hasina's government, Zia never gave up, refused to compromise on her principles and stood her ground.\nThe fact that hundreds of thousands of people, including those who didn't vote for her party, turned up for the funeral would be seen as a reflection of her popularity among the masses.\nThose who worked with her recall a leader who asked probing questions while making key decisions. As economist Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya noted, she left a lasting impression as \"a political leader who appreciated ideas and valued informed decision-making\".\nIn her later years, she suffered from multiple health problems. Despite this, the BNP said she had intended to run for parliament in February 2026, when the country will vote for the first time since a popular revolution last year unseated Hasina.\nAccording to the party's candidate list released earlier this month, Zia was to contest in three constituencies.\nThe party is eyeing a return to power, and if that happens, her son is expected to become the country's new leader.

But by summer, the US saw record highs fuelled by strong company profits and confidence in artificial intelligence investments.\nThe S&P 500 index is on track to end the year up about 17%, the third consecutive year of double-digit gains.\nNext year could shape up to be yet another big one for stock investors, analysts say. Still, with leadership changes at the US central bank and mounting concerns that AI stocks are overvalued, the path ahead might be bumpy.\nThe technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is poised for a 21% gain this year, while the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies is roughly 12% higher year-to-date.\nIn early April, when Trump announced sweeping tariffs on US trading partners, the S&P 500 fell to the brink of bear market territory - Wall Street's term for a drop of 20% from the latest high. Both the Nasdaq Composite and Russell 2000 indexes did briefly tumble into bear markets.\nBut major indexes quickly bounced back after Trump walked back his steepest tariffs, easing Wall Street's fears about a tariff-driven economic slowdown.\nStocks have since surged to new highs.\nThat's been in spite of persistent jitters about the economy, Robert Edwards, chief investment officer at Edwards Asset Management, said in a note.\n\"The market continues to climb the wall of worry into next year,\" he said.\nHe added that 2026 \"should be another year of record setting for stocks\", pointing in part to expectations for lower borrowing costs, which could boost corporate earnings and drive stock prices higher.\nStrong earnings growth in corporate America has been a key driver of the stock market rally since the tariff-driven whiplash in the spring, said Parag Thatte, an equity strategist at Deutsche Bank.\nAt the same time, geopolitical tensions, Trump's tariffs and expectations of interest rate cuts added to investor demand this year for safe haven assets, such as gold and other commodities. The price of gold is on track for a nearly 70% yearly increase.\nBitcoin, on the other hand, has struggled to keep up with strong returns across stocks and gold.\nDespite getting a boost earlier in the year from the Trump administration's support for digital assets, the world's largest cryptocurrency is poised to end 2025 slightly lower, after a sharp decline from its record highs in October.\nBroadening beyond tech\nEnthusiasm among investors about massive AI spending has helped several tech firms outperform the broader S&P 500.\nThe top five companies - Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet - make up almost 30% of the overall index.\nBut in recent months, fears have mounted in Silicon Valley and beyond of an AI bubble bursting, as the values of tech companies linked to AI have soared and companies keep spending big on the burgeoning industry.\nAnalysts note that corporate earnings growth appears to be broadening out beyond the tech sector. That could offer investors a cushion, as tech company valuations remain under intense scrutiny.\nMr Thatte, with Deutsche Bank, said growth picked up for average-sized companies in the third quarter of 2025, not just for tech giants. He called this a \"key development\".\nBut even with increasingly broad gains across the US stock market, whether the S&P 500 can maintain its momentum if the tech sector's rally were to slow remains to be seen.\n\"The rotation is already happening,\" Mr Thatte said, referring to investors pivoting away from Big Tech stocks. \"It might be noisy along the way.\"\nThere are also ongoing concerns among professional investors that some stocks outside of tech are overvalued, too.\nAnalysts at Vanguard predict annualized returns of about 3.5% to 5.5% for US stocks over the next decade - a relatively subdued outlook, compared to recent gains.\nPolicy risk is 'not subsiding'\nIn 2025, the US economy \"probably held up better than most people had expected,\" said David Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar.\nThe world's largest economy picked up speed over the three months to September, expanding at an annual rate of 4.3%, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter - the strongest growth in two years.\nBut that's not to say there aren't big economic question marks in the months ahead.\nThere's still the possibility that Trump tariff policies could prompt another jolt to markets. Negotations between Washington and major trading partners will be \"an ongoing headline\", Mr Sekera said.\nThe US labour market has also shown signs of weakness. The unemployment rate rose to a four-year high of 4.6% in November, up from 4.4% in September, according to Labor Department figures.\n\"With policy risk not subsiding anytime soon,\" analysts at Charles Schwab wrote in a research note, \"the bar for a pullback or mini correction in the beginning of 2026 is not terribly high.\"\nTrump is also expected to name a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming weeks, to succeed Jerome Powell after his term ends in May.\nThe decision is \"the big uncertainty\" for investors heading into 2026, Paul Stanley, chief investment officer at Granite Bay Wealth Management, said in a note.\nTrump, who has been pressuring Powell to lower interest rates, has said he will pick a Fed chair who he views as committed to easing borrowing costs.\nWall Street investors will be focused on understanding how the change in leadership will impact monetary policy moving forward.\n\"Fed chair transitions come with volatility,\" Mr Stanley said.\nThat leaves investors facing down plenty of unpredictability, even as analysts anticipate another strong year ahead.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyd8r1xgjko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2025-12-31T11:02:31+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Prices of gold and silver were also buoyed by gold purchases by central banks and investors buying so-called \"safe haven\" assets due to concerns about global tensions and economic uncertainty.\nDan Coatsworth, head of markets at investment platform AJ Bell, said soaring gold and silver prices had been driven by investors \"latching onto precious metals in response to concerns over inflation\" as well as volatile stock markets.\n\"The market backdrop looks unchanged as we move into 2026,\" he added.\nMr Coatsworth said high government debt in the UK and US, as well as Donald Trump's tariffs and nerves over a potential AI bubble, would encourage investors to \"stay bullish on gold and silver\".\nBut he warned sharp gains for the assets in 2025 make them vulnerable to a sharp pullback next year.\nHe said: \"If financial markets go through a difficult patch, investors looking to liquidate positions might first reach for assets that have delivered strong gains in the past year or so, or ones that are easy to sell. Gold ticks both boxes.\"\nMs Gule said she expects gold to continue to rise in 2026 but \"at a more stable pace compared to the record highs observed in 2025\".\nAlso this year, central banks around the world added hundreds of tons of gold to their reserves, according to the World Gold Council trade association.\nDaniel Takieddine, co-founder of investment firm Sky Links Capital Group, points to \"supply tightness and industrial demand\" for helping to push up the price of silver.\nChina, which is the world's second biggest producer of silver, has said it would restrict the export of the precious metal.\nIn October, China's Ministry of Commerce announced new restrictions on exports of silver as well as the metals tungsten and antimony to \"to step up the protection of resources and the environment\".\nResponding to a post on social media about Chinese government restrictions on silver exports, Tesla boss Elon Musk said: \"This is not good. Silver is needed in many industrial processes.\"\nMr Takieddine also highlighted the large amounts of money that have flowed into the precious metals market through investments like exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nETFs are baskets of investments that trade on a stock exchange like a single stock. They can be seen as a convenient way to trade precious metals as investors do not have to take possession of physical bullion.\nSilver also has the potential to rise again in the coming year, said Mr Takieddine.
