    "body": "BBC Radio 4's Today will follow six parents for five years, chronicling the ups and downs of looking after a young child in modern Britain.",
    "content": "How the 'postcode lottery' of parenting really impacts young children\nAt a children's centre in south London, six soon-to-be parents are comparing notes on the size of their unborn babies. They are all discussing how big the foetus is at various stages of pregnancy, using fruit and vegetables as a guide.\nDan from Edinburgh says that his baby, due in early January, was at one point the size of a grapefruit. Another father - Shaun from Gateshead - chimes in that his is cabbage-sized.\nAll six people - among them, a nurse, an electrician, a writer, a publicist, a physician's associate and a software developer - have travelled from across the country on a drizzly afternoon to take part in a social experiment.\nBBC Radio 4's Today programme plans to follow these families for five years, chronicling the ups and downs of looking after a young child in modern Britain.\nEarly childhood is an important stage of life in determining a child's long-term future, scientists say. But it's also a period that can get lost in our national politics, which so often seems to focus on the needs of the elderly and middle-aged.\nWes Streeting, the Health Secretary, says: \"Talk to the overwhelming majority of parents, good parents, they will take bullets for their children. I don't think that's reflected sufficiently in the state.\"\nAnd for many British parents raising a child can feel like a game of chance.\nAccess to childcare can be highly dependent on your postcode, campaigners say, and parental leave pay fluctuates wildly, depending on the generosity of employers, while others rely solely on statutory maternity and paternity leave pay.\nSo what effect does this so-called \"lottery\" of early years provision have, not only on the family but on the child and their future?\nGenerous employers vs statutory pay\nShaun, an electrician, is getting two weeks of paternity leave - the statutory minimum.\n\"It's not the best,\" he admits. \"And I found out the other day, if we had to go into hospital earlier for whatever reason, I would have to use holiday for that. [It] only starts when [the baby] is born.\"\nStill, he feels lucky. \"My work's been quite flexible.\"\nThe UK has a mixed record on maternity and paternity pay, explains Abby Jitendra, policy adviser at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank. Mothers get more time off compared with other European countries, but a relatively poor replacement for their wages, while fathers get one of the least generous deals in Europe, she argues.\nBut what really shines through is the sense of lottery. How much you're paid in your baby's first year is determined largely by your employer, she says - and this of course impacts how much time parents can afford to take off.\nThe state guarantees employed mothers a basic pay of 90% of their average weekly earnings for six weeks, and then a statutory minimum of \u00a3187.18 per week for the next 33 weeks (or 90% of their earnings, if that is lower). Employed fathers, meanwhile, receive that same statutory minimum for two weeks. Self-employed parents get a different benefit.\nBut certain employers - including some tech and financial services firms, and some highly unionised public sector employers - offer their staff much more. Some workers get six months off on full pay.\nThe income difference between those generous workplace policies and statutory provision is \"really night and day\", Ms Jitendra argues. It ultimately means that some parents are forced back to work much quicker than others, giving them less time with their children.\nIt is hard to pinpoint exactly what impact these policies have on a child's long-term future, says Emily Jones, an early years neuroscientist at Birkbeck, University of London.\nSome assume that a generous maternity or paternity leave policy benefits an infant, because it allows a parent to be at home for more time during their child's crucial first year of development. But Prof Jones says it is more complicated.\nWhat matters is that a baby has regular interaction with at least one \"stable attachment figure\", she says - it is not important whether that is a parent, or a nursery worker or childminder.\nWhat is true, she says, is that a generous parental leave policy can reduce stress in a household, which certainly benefits a child.\nWithout decent parental leave, she says, there is a risk that parents are forced to \"juggle\" work with childcare, or simply get by on a lower income.\n\"Those increases in stress, not being able to spend the time you have with [the] baby in a relaxed way - those are things that are going to be problematic.\"\nLow uptake of shared parental leave\nShaun and Miranda considered taking Shared Parental Leave (SPL), a state-funded scheme that allows parents to share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of state-funded pay - but they calculated that it wouldn't make financial sense for them.\nTake-up of shared parental leave has risen since it was introduced by the Coalition in 2015, but it remains low. Just 1% of mothers and 5% of fathers used it between 2015 and 2020, a government report from 2023 suggests.\nAmong those fathers who did not take shared parental leave, almost half (45%) were not even aware the scheme existed, the report found.\nCampaign group The Dad Shift, has argued that the scheme is \"failing working families\". According to the group's analysis of HMRC data, 95% of claims for state-funded SPL in 2024-25 were made by fathers or partners in the top half of earners.\nBut others argue that it should not be the responsibility of the state to ensure that everybody gets equal time off work to look after their child. Maxwell Marlow, director of public affairs at the Adam Smith Institute, a think tank, says there should be a \"baseline minimum\" maternity and paternity pay, but beyond that it should be left to individual workers to negotiate with their employers.\nAny attempt by the government to expand parental leave provision risks placing onerous demands on already-struggling businesses, he thinks.\nThe Department for Work and Pensions say they have launched a review into parental leave and pay \"to better support working families as part of our Plan for Change\".\nThe childcare 'postcode lottery'\nMiranda, a nurse, is already thinking about what happens when her maternity leave ends. Her own mother has saved up annual leave to use.\n\"Your mum's going to be very, very busy,\" Shaun laughs.\nWorking parents in England are now eligible for 30 hours of state-funded childcare per week during term-time, for children from the age of nine months to four.\nThe policy, which came fully into effect in September 2025, was initiated by the Conservatives and continued by Labour, and marked a \"step change\" in childcare provision, says Ms Jitendra.\nYet some families say they have fallen between the gaps.\nThat's because all adults in a household must be working and earn more than \u00a310,158 but less than \u00a3100,000 per year to be eligible.\nOne father, David from London, whose wife was retraining to be an occupational therapist, told the BBC last year that he was devastated after realising they didn't qualify because she wasn't earning at the time.\n\"It seems to be a huge oversight,\" he said at the time.\nEven for those who do qualify, a place is not guaranteed as nursery provision varies so much.\nA report last year from Ofsted, the body that regulates and inspects early years education, found vast inequalities across different areas. For example, it identified Walsall in the West Midlands as a childcare \"desert\", with just 13.5 childcare places per 100 nursery-age children; while Richmond-upon-Thames in west London was named an \"oasis\", on account of its 39.8 places per 100 nursery-aged children. (This may sound low too but only 64% of children use formal childcare, and many only do so on certain days.)\nThis so-called postcode lottery is partly driven by money. Private nursery chains, which have become a bigger share of the childcare market in recent years, tend to open in more affluent areas where there is a greater profit incentive.\nBut the lottery is even more random than that. Even within postcodes, there's huge variability between nurseries based on training and experience of staff, argues Chris Pascal, a professor of early years education and the director of the Centre for Research in Early Childhood, a charity.\n\"It depends on [many things] - have they got people who love children, who enjoy their work, who have been professionally trained?\"\nA Department for Education spokesperson said they are investing \u00a39.5bn into early years over 2026, part of an effort \"to back working parents\" by covering the costs of 30 hours childcare a week, saving families up to \u00a37,500 per child per year.\nThey added: \"The latest data shows childcare capacity is continuing to grow, and our new school-based nurseries and government-funded childcare expansion are already playing a vital role in supporting families in more disadvantaged communities.\"\nBrain development and early socialisation\nSam Wass, a neuroscientist specialising in early years at the University of East London, says that during the first few years of a child's life, the learning capacity of an infant's brain \"far outstrips an adult's brain\".\nEarly socialisation is particularly important, he says. \"What babies need and what they learn from the best are simple, slow, repetitious, face-to-face interactions.\"\nSome experts think that the more support parents get - either from the state, or from their employer - the better their baby's brain develops.\nTake childcare. Prof Pascal argues that what a child crucially needs during their early years is interaction, both from adults and from other children - and that a high-quality nursery can be the ideal environment for this.\nThere, professionally trained staff can teach children how to play, explore, and negotiate conflicts with other children - all of which helps stimulate their brains.\n\"A quality nursery is astonishingly good in terms of advancing a child's life chances,\" she says.\nBut Prof Jones thinks the long-term impact of nursery on a child's development is more complicated. Before a child turns two, she says, they need a \"stable caregiver\" they can interact with.\nThey can get that at nursery but they can also find it at home, she says.\nIt's after a child is two that nursery becomes \"actively beneficial\".

    "content_clean": "How the 'postcode lottery' of parenting really impacts young children At a children's centre in south London, six soon-to-be parents are comparing notes on the size of their unborn babies. They are all discussing how big the foetus is at various stages of pregnancy, using fruit and vegetables as a guide. Dan from Edinburgh says that his baby, due in early January, was at one point the size of a grapefruit. Another father - Shaun from Gateshead - chimes in that his is cabbage-sized. All six people - among them, a nurse, an electrician, a writer, a publicist, a physician's associate and a software developer - have travelled from across the country on a drizzly afternoon to take part in a social experiment. BBC Radio 4's Today programme plans to follow these families for five years, chronicling the ups and downs of looking after a young child in modern Britain. Early childhood is an important stage of life in determining a child's long-term future, scientists say. But it's also a period that can get lost in our national politics, which so often seems to focus on the needs of the elderly and middle-aged. Wes Streeting, the Health Secretary, says: \"Talk to the overwhelming majority of parents, good parents, they will take bullets for their children. I don't think that's reflected sufficiently in the state.\" And for many British parents raising a child can feel like a game of chance. Access to childcare can be highly dependent on your postcode, campaigners say, and parental leave pay fluctuates wildly, depending on the generosity of employers, while others rely solely on statutory maternity and paternity leave pay. So what effect does this so-called \"lottery\" of early years provision have, not only on the family but on the child and their future? Generous employers vs statutory pay Shaun, an electrician, is getting two weeks of paternity leave - the statutory minimum. \"It's not the best,\" he admits. \"And I found out the other day, if we had to go into hospital earlier for whatever reason, I would have to use holiday for that. [It] only starts when [the baby] is born.\" Still, he feels lucky. \"My work's been quite flexible.\" The UK has a mixed record on maternity and paternity pay, explains Abby Jitendra, policy adviser at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank. Mothers get more time off compared with other European countries, but a relatively poor replacement for their wages, while fathers get one of the least generous deals in Europe, she argues. But what really shines through is the sense of lottery. How much you're paid in your baby's first year is determined largely by your employer, she says - and this of course impacts how much time parents can afford to take off. The state guarantees employed mothers a basic pay of 90% of their average weekly earnings for six weeks, and then a statutory minimum of \u00a3187.18 per week for the next 33 weeks (or 90% of their earnings, if that is lower). Employed fathers, meanwhile, receive that same statutory minimum for two weeks. Self-employed parents get a different benefit. But certain employers - including some tech and financial services firms, and some highly unionised public sector employers - offer their staff much more. Some workers get six months off on full pay. The income difference between those generous workplace policies and statutory provision is \"really night and day\", Ms Jitendra argues. It ultimately means that some parents are forced back to work much quicker than others, giving them less time with their children. It is hard to pinpoint exactly what impact these policies have on a child's long-term future, says Emily Jones, an early years neuroscientist at Birkbeck, University of London. Some assume that a generous maternity or paternity leave policy benefits an infant, because it allows a parent to be at home for more time during their child's crucial first year of development. But Prof Jones says it is more complicated. What matters is that a baby has regular interaction with at least one \"stable attachment figure\", she says - it is not important whether that is a parent, or a nursery worker or childminder. What is true, she says, is that a generous parental leave policy can reduce stress in a household, which certainly benefits a child. Without decent parental leave, she says, there is a risk that parents are forced to \"juggle\" work with childcare, or simply get by on a lower income. \"Those increases in stress, not being able to spend the time you have with [the] baby in a relaxed way - those are things that are going to be problematic.\" Low uptake of shared parental leave Shaun and Miranda considered taking Shared Parental Leave (SPL), a state-funded scheme that allows parents to share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of state-funded pay - but they calculated that it wouldn't make financial sense for them. Take-up of shared parental leave has risen since it was introduced by the Coalition in 2015, but it remains low. Just 1% of mothers and 5% of fathers used it between 2015 and 2020, a government report from 2023 suggests. Among those fathers who did not take shared parental leave, almost half (45%) were not even aware the scheme existed, the report found. Campaign group The Dad Shift, has argued that the scheme is \"failing working families\". According to the group's analysis of HMRC data, 95% of claims for state-funded SPL in 2024-25 were made by fathers or partners in the top half of earners. But others argue that it should not be the responsibility of the state to ensure that everybody gets equal time off work to look after their child. Maxwell Marlow, director of public affairs at the Adam Smith Institute, a think tank, says there should be a \"baseline minimum\" maternity and paternity pay, but beyond that it should be left to individual workers to negotiate with their employers. Any attempt by the government to expand parental leave provision risks placing onerous demands on already-struggling businesses, he thinks. The Department for Work and Pensions say they have launched a review into parental leave and pay \"to better support working families as part of our Plan for Change\". The childcare 'postcode lottery' Miranda, a nurse, is already thinking about what happens when her maternity leave ends. Her own mother has saved up annual leave to use. \"Your mum's going to be very, very busy,\" Shaun laughs. Working parents in England are now eligible for 30 hours of state-funded childcare per week during term-time, for children from the age of nine months to four. The policy, which came fully into effect in September 2025, was initiated by the Conservatives and continued by Labour, and marked a \"step change\" in childcare provision, says Ms Jitendra. Yet some families say they have fallen between the gaps. That's because all adults in a household must be working and earn more than \u00a310,158 but less than \u00a3100,000 per year to be eligible. One father, David from London, whose wife was retraining to be an occupational therapist, told the BBC last year that he was devastated after realising they didn't qualify because she wasn't earning at the time. \"It seems to be a huge oversight,\" he said at the time. Even for those who do qualify, a place is not guaranteed as nursery provision varies so much. A report last year from Ofsted, the body that regulates and inspects early years education, found vast inequalities across different areas. For example, it identified Walsall in the West Midlands as a childcare \"desert\", with just 13.5 childcare places per 100 nursery-age children; while Richmond-upon-Thames in west London was named an \"oasis\", on account of its 39.8 places per 100 nursery-aged children. (This may sound low too but only 64% of children use formal childcare, and many only do so on certain days.) This so-called postcode lottery is partly driven by money. Private nursery chains, which have become a bigger share of the childcare market in recent years, tend to open in more affluent areas where there is a greater profit incentive. But the lottery is even more random than that. Even within postcodes, there's huge variability between nurseries based on training and experience of staff, argues Chris Pascal, a professor of early years education and the director of the Centre for Research in Early Childhood, a charity. \"It depends on [many things] - have they got people who love children, who enjoy their work, who have been professionally trained?\" A Department for Education spokesperson said they are investing \u00a39.5bn into early years over 2026, part of an effort \"to back working parents\" by covering the costs of 30 hours childcare a week, saving families up to \u00a37,500 per child per year. They added: \"The latest data shows childcare capacity is continuing to grow, and our new school-based nurseries and government-funded childcare expansion are already playing a vital role in supporting families in more disadvantaged communities.\" Brain development and early socialisation Sam Wass, a neuroscientist specialising in early years at the University of East London, says that during the first few years of a child's life, the learning capacity of an infant's brain \"far outstrips an adult's brain\". Early socialisation is particularly important, he says. \"What babies need and what they learn from the best are simple, slow, repetitious, face-to-face interactions.\" Some experts think that the more support parents get - either from the state, or from their employer - the better their baby's brain develops. Take childcare. Prof Pascal argues that what a child crucially needs during their early years is interaction, both from adults and from other children - and that a high-quality nursery can be the ideal environment for this. There, professionally trained staff can teach children how to play, explore, and negotiate conflicts with other children - all of which helps stimulate their brains. \"A quality nursery is astonishingly good in terms of advancing a child's life chances,\" she says. But Prof Jones thinks the long-term impact of nursery on a child's development is more complicated. Before a child turns two, she says, they need a \"stable caregiver\" they can interact with. They can get that at nursery but they can also find it at home, she says. It's after a child is two that nursery becomes \"actively beneficial\". At that point, \"they start to interact with their peers and understand who other children are - that all becomes really important.\" Baby boxes and green spaces Anna and Dan, another couple taking part in the experiment, received a \"baby box\" in the post in the autumn - a cardboard box containing a digital thermometer, changing mat, mattress, health information, clothes, and baby books. They live in Scotland, where every pregnant mother is entitled to one, as part of a policy introduced by the Holyrood government in 2017. Anna says it's a \"massive lifeline\". \"It really does provide everything you need for the first six months.\" \"We've heard about the box,\" Adam, from Staffordshire, says with a laugh. As he lives in England, he and his partner aren't eligible to receive one. It's another of the other small differences that affect parents across the UK. The benefits of the box aren't entirely clear. Research carried out at the University of Glasgow found that the introduction of the box brought no change to infant hospital admissions, though it did lead to a small increase in breastfeeding and a small decrease in tobacco exposure (perhaps because of health information included in the box on those topics). The \"absolute effects were small\", the researchers concluded. Then there is the varying availability - and quality - of parks, playgrounds, and libraries depending on where you live. A report last year by charity, Fields in Trust, looked at how many people in Britain live within a 10-minute walk of an accessible green space (like a public park or an open sports field). In big cities such as London, Manchester, and Liverpool, more than 95% of people have this benefit, the report found. But in other places - including East Lindsey in Lincolnshire - fewer than 75% do. Prof Pascal says these public places are vital. \"For young children, play is the stuff of life. This is how they operate, learn, interact. \"For cognitive development, brain development, play is where the child is really pushing the boundaries.\" Ultimately, parenting in modern Britain remains unpredictable.

    "content": "We fought for 33 years to abolish not proven verdict after our daughter's murder\nJoe and Kate Duffy were devastated and baffled when the man accused of their daughter's murder walked free from court.\nThey had felt certain that Francis Auld would be found guilty of killing 19-year-old Amanda in Hamilton in 1992.\nBut a jury found the charges against him not proven - one of two verdicts of acquittal which could be returned in criminal trials in Scotland.\nJoe and Kate did not initially understand what the jury's verdict meant \u2013 and have now spent more than three decades campaigning for the abolition of not proven.\nFrom 1 January, this centuries-old verdict has been consigned to the history books and Scottish trials will end with the accused being found either guilty or not guilty.\n\"There's some solace in the fact that no other family will have to go through this,\" said Kate.\n\"There's relief and a feeling of vindication - but most importantly, it's for our daughter. It's for Amanda.\"\nAmanda had gone missing after a night out in her hometown of Hamilton in May 1992. Her body was found on waste ground the next day.\nBy any standards, the murder of the 19-year-old drama student had been exceptionally brutal.\nHer numerous injuries included a bite on her breast which the defence agreed had been inflicted by Auld.\nWhen the jury at the High Court in Glasgow announced the not proven verdict, Joe and Kate had no idea what it meant.\nThey listened in astonishment as the judge told Francis Auld he had been acquitted and was free to go.\nAfterwards, in a side room, lawyers explained that in the eyes of the law, not proven was exactly the same as not guilty.

    "content_clean": "We fought for 33 years to abolish not proven verdict after our daughter's murder Joe and Kate Duffy were devastated and baffled when the man accused of their daughter's murder walked free from court. They had felt certain that Francis Auld would be found guilty of killing 19-year-old Amanda in Hamilton in 1992. But a jury found the charges against him not proven - one of two verdicts of acquittal which could be returned in criminal trials in Scotland. Joe and Kate did not initially understand what the jury's verdict meant \u2013 and have now spent more than three decades campaigning for the abolition of not proven. From 1 January, this centuries-old verdict has been consigned to the history books and Scottish trials will end with the accused being found either guilty or not guilty. \"There's some solace in the fact that no other family will have to go through this,\" said Kate. \"There's relief and a feeling of vindication - but most importantly, it's for our daughter. It's for Amanda.\" Amanda had gone missing after a night out in her hometown of Hamilton in May 1992. Her body was found on waste ground the next day. By any standards, the murder of the 19-year-old drama student had been exceptionally brutal. Her numerous injuries included a bite on her breast which the defence agreed had been inflicted by Auld. When the jury at the High Court in Glasgow announced the not proven verdict, Joe and Kate had no idea what it meant. They listened in astonishment as the judge told Francis Auld he had been acquitted and was free to go. Afterwards, in a side room, lawyers explained that in the eyes of the law, not proven was exactly the same as not guilty. Auld had been cleared and could never be tried again. Kate fainted. She was carried from the building on a stretcher and taken to hospital. Joe said that throughout the case the police and prosecution had assured the couple that they had a very strong case and expected to get a guilty verdict. \"So when it was not proven, you were like, what exactly does that mean? There's something wrong here.\" \"It was the fear of knowing that the person who was responsible, in my eyes, was still out there and capable of doing it again,\" said Kate. A common interpretation of not proven was that the jury suspected the accused was guilty, but felt the prosecution had failed to prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt. Good luck finding that in a law book. As Joe and Kate were to discover, there was no written legal definition of not proven. Over the years, whenever juries asked, all judges could tell them was that it was a verdict of acquittal, just like not guilty. Research has also shown that some people thought - incorrectly - that the accused could be tried again if the verdict was not proven. That has been allowed in exceptional circumstances since 2011 under double jeopardy legislation, but the method of acquittal plays no part in that process. Within weeks of the verdict in November 1992, Joe and Kate had set up a table in a street in Hamilton, gathering tens of thousands of signatures for a petition calling for not proven to go. Joe explained: \"I've never understood why you can have two verdicts which mean exactly the same thing. \"The only difference in law between not proven and not guilty is spelling. \"That's it. Why do we need them? Either you're guilty or not guilty.\" Hamilton's Labour MP George Robertson believed some juries were using not proven as a \"cop out\" and put forward a private members' bill at Westminster proposing abolition. He failed to win the backing of the then Conservative government and not proven survived. The Duffys regarded the bill's failure as a stumbling block rather than a knockout blow. They set up a charity to help other families bereaved by murder, culpable homicide and suicide. The beginning of the end Ten years ago they established a counselling facility in Hamilton called the Manda Centre, the family's nickname for Amanda. It was a case in 2015 that finally signalled the beginning of the end for not proven. A jury used it when they cleared a man accused of raping a student at St Andrews University. The victim, known as Miss M, sued Stephen Coxen for damages in a civil court and won. The sheriff accepted she had been raped by Coxen. It was said to be the first civil damages action for rape following an unsuccessful criminal prosecution in almost a century. The outcome would have struck a chord with the Duffys. In 1995, Joe and Kate had sued Frances Auld over Amanda's death and won damages - which were never paid. A new campaign for abolition, led by Miss M and backed by Rape Crisis Scotland, argued that not proven was used disproportionately in sexual offence cases. They said it offered juries \"an easy out\" and contributed to \"guilty people\" walking free. Their case won support from leading politicians, including Nicola Sturgeon, who was first minister at the time. In 2022, the SNP administration at Holyrood proposed a raft of legal reforms, including the removal of not proven. Controversy over the verdict dates back to the mid-19th Century and the arguments for and against have changed very little over the years. Critics said it was confusing for juries and the public, failed to provide closure for alleged victims, and stigmatized the person on trial by appearing not to clear them completely. Supporters of the verdict argued that it was an important safeguard against wrongful convictions. Scotland's top lawyers - the Faculty of Advocates - put it this way: \"The not proven verdict may be a safety valve for jurors who have not reached the threshold for conviction but reject the impossibility of guilt.\" But this time, abolition had cross-party support and not proven's days were numbered. The Scottish government's bill was passed by MSPs September this year, with Miss M and the Duffys watching from the public gallery at the Scottish Parliament. In what was portrayed as a counter-balance, the legislation brought about another crucial change. Scottish juries have 15 members. Until now, a guilty verdict could be returned through a simple majority - eight votes out of 15. From today, a two-thirds majority will be required. At least 10 out of 15 jurors will have to support a conviction. The Scottish government said there was clear evidence that jurors were more likely to convict if they only had a choice of guilty or not guilty, and the change would ensure the system was fair and balanced. Prosecutors at the Crown Office and campaigners at Rape Crisis Scotland fear the change will make it harder to get convictions. The Law Society of Scotland would have preferred the unanimity or near-unanimity required by the jury system in England and Wales. It could be years before the consequences of all of this become clear. In 2016, prosecutors sought permission to put Francis Auld on trial for a second time over Amanda's murder, using the new double jeopardy law. Their application was turned down by the courts. Auld died from cancer in 2017. \"The grief part, you learn to live with it,\" said Kate. \"You learn to live your life in a different way.\" The couple paid tribute to Miss M and the part she played in bringing about the end of not proven. \"I take my hat off to her because she's really put herself out there,\" said Joe. \"There have been an awful lot of false dawns along the way but we've never, never given up. \"So for anybody who wants to campaign for something to be changed, don't stop, keep going for it. \"It might have taken us 33 years but you know something - we finally got there.\"",

So quite honestly, what's not to like?\" She added: \"I write books which are all about people not being who they seem, and The Traitors is like the quintessence of people not being who they seem. I might bring an ability to see patterns in people's behaviour.\" 'Deceptive, devious and cunning' Also on the line-up is retired police detective Amanda, 57, from Brighton, who also plans to utilise her professional skills. \"I've done lots of interviews with criminals and victims,\" she noted. \"You have to put the pieces together to find the truth and see through the lies. \"To be a traitor, you have to be good at lying, have a good poker face and be a master of deflection to prevent you being identified. I've learned a lot about being deceptive, devious and cunning.\" Psychologist Ellie, 33, plans to keep her job a secret from her fellow contestants. \"Hopefully I'm going to be able to use all my psychological techniques to play the game as well as possible, whether I'm a traitor or a faithful, whether that's building up relationships with people or deceiving people and concealing how I really feel,\" she said. \"I'm going to be analysing what other contestants are doing and trying to think through what their motivations are for behaving in certain ways.\" Gardener James, 38, believes he could fare well in the castle because he was \"mildly successful playing poker\" in the past. \"I was even nicknamed The Librarian by a few people because I have this innate ability to read people like a book,\" he explained. And 32-year-old cyber security expert Stephen, from the Outer Hebrides but now based in London, has done the maths and decided he would rather be a traitor than a faithful. \"I can be a bit of a control freak, and I feel like as a traitor, it really is the best way to take control of the game,\" he said. \"Your chances of going home are slashed by 50% because you can only go out by banishment. Whereas, if you're a faithful, you've got two chances of being banished or murdered.\" The Traitors 2026: The cast in full - Adam, 34, a builder from Essex - Amanda, 57, retired police detective from Brighton - Ben, 66, retiree from Hampshire - Ellie, 33, psychologist from London - Faraaz, 22, internal auditor from Middlesbrough - Fiona, 62, local government officer from Swansea - Harriet, 52, crime writer and former barrister from London - Hugo, 51, barrister originally from Cardiff - Jack, 29, personal trainer from Essex - Jade, 25, PhD Student from the West Midlands - James, 38, gardener from Weymouth - Jessie, 28, hairstylist from Hull - Judy, 60, child liaison officer from Doncaster - Matthew, 35, creative director from Edinburgh - Maz, 59, civil servant from Preston - Netty, 42, nursery school teacher from Glasgow - Rachel, 42, head of communications from County Down - Reece, 27, sweet shop assistant from Sheffield - Ross, 37, sales exec and personal trainer from London - Roxy, 32, recruiter from Amsterdam - Sam, 34, account manager from North Yorkshire - Stephen, 32, cyber security consultant from London",

Both parties are hoping to make gains in the polls, which cover the Scottish parliament and the Welsh Senedd as well as thousands of council seats in England and a handful of directly elected mayoralties.

    "content_clean": "The \u00a33m race to save polar explorer Shackleton's villa Work is under way on a South Atlantic island to preserve a key building in the story of polar explorer Ernest Shackleton. Shackleton famously reached the whaling station of Stromness on South Georgia in 1916 after spending 18 months stranded on Antarctica with his crew. The now-dilapidated Stromness Manager's Villa was used as a base by Shackleton while he orchestrated the rescue of his men. The Dundee-based South Georgia Heritage Trust have been working to stabilise the structure, with plans to create a digital \"twin\" of the building for people around the world to see it. A 2022 survey found the building was very close to collapse. Alison Neil, chief executive of the South Georgia Heritage Trust, said: \"The reason for that is rotting timbers. \"This is an old-fashioned version of a flat-pack house. \"They would've been brought down from Norway on ships and then assembled on the island.\" The trust raised more than \u00a33m to send a team to South Georgia. They arrived in October and have been working on stabilising the structure. Alison said: \"It's in the middle of a whaling station that's full of asbestos, dangerous debris, and is not accessible to the public. \"Our plan is not to open it up to the public, our plan is to maintain it for the future.\" Shackleton's extraordinary story of survival has fascinated and inspired people for more than a century. His most famous mission was his plan to cross Antarctica through the South Pole on board his ship The Endurance. In 1915, The Endurance became trapped in ice, and his crew abandoned ship, crossing onto floating ice, where they decided they were going to live until they could be saved. In April 1916, Shackleton took five crew members in a small boat in search of help for the others. They travelled over 807 miles (1,300km) of ocean before reaching the island of South Georgia. Leaving three of the men behind, Shackleton, Frank Worsley and Tom Crean trekked across the island for three days until they reached Stromness whaling station. Alison said the men made it to the villa in a dishevelled state. She said: \"No-one recognised them, they must've looked terrifying. \"They knocked on the door of the villa and famously the whaling manager opened the door and said, 'who the hell are you?' \"Shackleton allegedly said: 'My name is Shackleton'.\" It was the men's first contact with the outside world for 17 months. Shackleton, Worsley and Crean were invited in to the villa where they had a hot meal and a bath, before immediately starting the rescue of the rest of their crew with the help of the whalers. Alison said: \"That's a really important part of The Endurance story and it effectively is the next chapter on from the sinking of the vessel.\" In the coming weeks, digital specialists will go to South Georgia to scan the structure. Alison said: \"They're going to capture everything that lets us decide, at some point, how we're going to make this accessible to people. \"It will definitely be available on our website, for example. \"But we might also want to create a version where people can put a headset on and actually experience walking in to the room as it would've been in 1916.\" Alison said that \"heritage shouldn't be a privilege.\" She said: \"You don't want it to just be something that inspires the people that can afford to come to an island. \"So many people are really fascinated by the story of Shackleton and the Endurance. \"It would be great to be able to tell everyone around the world who is keen on this story, this chapter. \"The most effective way to do that is to let them experience it for themselves through a digital version.\" This season, 100 ships are expected to visit South Georgia, bringing around 18,000 visitors. Shetlander Helen Balfour is the assistant curator at the South Georgia Museum in Grytviken, one of the island's former whaling stations. She said she sees a lot of people interested in Shackleton at the museum. \"People are interested in the wildlife, but actually there's a lot of people who want to come to South Georgia to pay their respects to him.\" Shackleton died on board his ship, Quest, in 1922 and was buried in Grytviken. Helen said: \"People want to come to toast 'The Boss' and it's something that a lot of the ships will make sure they schedule in to their time in South Georgia. \"I think people are really inspired by his leadership and his ability to get through anything. \"I think people are really intrigued by his expeditions and how he managed to keep going in the face of adversity.\"",

The island of Kiritimati - an atoll in the remote Pacific nation of Kiribati - became the first place to enter 2026. One tourist there told us he marked it \"on a beach with no satellites, no signs of human life, complete darkness and countless crabs\". Spectators in the UK have enjoyed thousands of fireworks light up London skies, while in Edinburgh crowds gathered in true Hogmanay fashion despite weather warnings. In New York City, the ball dropped in Times Square amid confetti and cheers, watched by a crowd estimated to be around a million strong. Australia lit up the sky over the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge with their famous fireworks display. In Sydney, celebrations were tempered by sadness as the nation reflected on the Bondi Beach attack on 14 December in which 15 people were killed. At 23:00 local time, Sydney Harbour fell silent for a minute, with crowds holding lights to remember the victims of Bondi. A Jewish menorah was projected on to the pylons of the Harbour Bridge. Elsewhere, there were more fireworks at Marina Bay Waterfront in Singapore. Fireworks matched the brilliance of skyscraper lights in Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines. Thousands lined the Chao Phraya river in Bangkok as Thailand welcomed the New Year. In Dubai, people watched fireworks from the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, following a performance with light displays, music and water jets. In Hong Kong, spectators enjoyed live performances with fetching headwear. The Juyongguan Great Wall was lit up in Beijing. Laser lights dominated the night sky over the Lotte World Tower, South Korea's tallest building in Seoul. At the Bosingak pavilion in Seoul, artists performed during the New Year countdown. A street performer showed off her fiery skills as part of the Procession of Light in Dublin before heading to the Matinee Countdown Concert in Dublin Castle. In other parts of the world, nations marked the coming New Year with their own traditions. On a nudist beach in Le Cap d'Agde, southern France, clothed and unclothed revellers took part in a traditional sea dip to mark the New Year's celebrations. Swimmers at Islands Brygge Harbour Bath in Copenhagen, Denmark, also braved the cold waters for a traditional splash, known as Nytaarsbad. In Ommen, the Netherlands, local residents watched the annual carbide shooting - a New Year's Eve tradition of turning milk cans into cannons. In Osaka, Japan, young women dressed in traditional kimono took part in a Shinto ritual procession to mark the end of the year at Sumiyoshi Taisha, one of Japan's oldest Shinto shrines. Colourful runners braved the December air in Krakow, Poland, for the traditional Krakow New Year's Run in the Old Town. Adults and children performed a traditional dance to release the sun of 2025, and to welcome the sun of 2026, in in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia.",

    "content": "Condom tax and cheaper childcare: China's plan to boost birth rates\nChinese people will pay a 13% sales tax on contraceptives from 1 January, while childcare services will be exempt, as the world's second-largest economy tries to boost birth rates.\nAn overhaul of the tax system announced late last year removes many exemptions that were in place since 1994, when China was still enforcing its decades-long one-child rule.\nIt also exempts marriage-related services and elderly care from value added tax (VAT) - part of a broader effort that includes extending parental leave and issuing cash handouts.\nFaced with an ageing population and sluggish economy, Beijing has been trying hard to encourage more young Chinese people to marry, and couples to have children.\nOfficial figures show that China's population has shrunk three years in a row, with just 9.54 million babies born in 2024. That is around half of the number of births recorded a decade ago, when China started to ease its rules on how many children people could have.\nStill, the tax on contraceptives, including condoms, birth control pills and devices, has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates, as well as ridicule. Some people point out that it would take a lot more than pricey condoms to persuade them to have children.\nAs one retailer urged shoppers to stock up ahead of the price hike, a social media user joked: \"I'll buy a lifetime's worth of condoms now.\"\nPeople can tell the difference between the price of a condom and that of raising a child, wrote another.\nChina is one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing. Costs are pushed up by school fees in a highly competitive academic environment, and the challenge women have juggling work and parenting, the study said.\nThe economic slowdown, partly brought on by a property crisis that has hit savings, has left families, and especially young people, feeling uncertain or less confident about their future.\n\"I have one child, and I don't want any more,\" says 36-year-old Daniel Luo, who lives in the eastern province of Henan.\n\"It's like when subway fares increase. When they go up by a yuan or two, people who take the subway don't change their habits. You still have to take the subway, right?\"\nHe says he is not concerned by the price hike. \"A box of condoms might cost an extra five yuan, maybe 10, at most 20. Over a year, that's just a few hundred yuan, completely affordable.\"\nBut cost might be a problem for others, and that's what worries Rosy Zhao, who lives in the city of Xi'an in central China.\nShe says making contraception, which is a necessity, more expensive could mean students or those struggling financially \"take a risk\".\nThat would be the policy's \"most dangerous potential outcome\", she added.\nObservers appear divided on the aim of the tax overhaul. The idea that a tax hike on condoms will impact birth rates is \"overthinking it\", says demographer Yi Fuxian from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nHe believes Beijing is keen to collect taxes \"wherever it can\" as it battles a housing market slump and growing national debt.\nAt nearly $1tn (\u00a3742bn), China's VAT revenue made up close to 40% of the country's tax collection last year.\nThe move to tax condoms is \"symbolic\" and reflects Beijing's attempts to encourage people to lift China's \"strikingly low\" fertility numbers, said Henrietta Levin from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nWhat is also hampering efforts, she adds, is that a lot of the policies and subsidies will have to be implemented by indebted provincial governments - and it's unclear if they can spare sufficient resources.\nChina's approach to urging people to have children also risks backfiring if people feel the government is being \"too intrusive\" about what is deeply personal choice, she said.\nRecently there have been media reports that women in some provinces have received calls from local officials asking about their menstrual cycles and plans to have children. The local health bureau in Yunnan province said such data was needed to identify expectant mothers.\nBut this has not helped the government's image, Ms Levin said. \"The [Communist] party can't help but insert itself into every decision that it cares about. So it ends up being its own worst enemy in some ways.\"\nObservers and women themselves say the country's male-dominated leadership fails to understand the social changes underpinning these broader shifts, which are not exclusive to China.\nCountries in the West and even those in the region, such as South Korea and Japan, have been struggling to lift birth rates as their population ages.\nPart of the reason is the burden of childcare, which disproportionately falls on women, research shows. But there are also other shifts, such as a decline in marriage and even dating.\nChina's measures miss the real problem: the way young people interact today, which increasingly avoids genuine human connections, Mr Luo from Henan said.\nHe points to rising sales of sex toys in China, which he believes is a sign that \"people are just satisfying themselves\" because \"interacting with another person has become more of a burden\".\nBeing online is easier and more comforting, he says, as \"the pressure is real\".\n\"Young people today deal with way more stress from society than people did 20 years ago. Sure, materially they're better off, but the expectations placed on them are much higher. Everyone's just exhausted.\"",

The move to tax condoms is \"symbolic\" and reflects Beijing's attempts to encourage people to lift China's \"strikingly low\" fertility numbers, said Henrietta Levin from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. What is also hampering efforts, she adds, is that a lot of the policies and subsidies will have to be implemented by indebted provincial governments - and it's unclear if they can spare sufficient resources. China's approach to urging people to have children also risks backfiring if people feel the government is being \"too intrusive\" about what is deeply personal choice, she said. Recently there have been media reports that women in some provinces have received calls from local officials asking about their menstrual cycles and plans to have children. The local health bureau in Yunnan province said such data was needed to identify expectant mothers. But this has not helped the government's image, Ms Levin said. \"The [Communist] party can't help but insert itself into every decision that it cares about. So it ends up being its own worst enemy in some ways.\" Observers and women themselves say the country's male-dominated leadership fails to understand the social changes underpinning these broader shifts, which are not exclusive to China. Countries in the West and even those in the region, such as South Korea and Japan, have been struggling to lift birth rates as their population ages. Part of the reason is the burden of childcare, which disproportionately falls on women, research shows. But there are also other shifts, such as a decline in marriage and even dating. China's measures miss the real problem: the way young people interact today, which increasingly avoids genuine human connections, Mr Luo from Henan said. He points to rising sales of sex toys in China, which he believes is a sign that \"people are just satisfying themselves\" because \"interacting with another person has become more of a burden\". Being online is easier and more comforting, he says, as \"the pressure is real\". \"Young people today deal with way more stress from society than people did 20 years ago. Sure, materially they're better off, but the expectations placed on them are much higher. Everyone's just exhausted.\"",

The former left-back, 52, updated fans on his condition via his Instagram page, which included a picture of him smiling in a hospital bed. He also denied rumours that he had suffered a heart attack. \"I would like to clarify recent information that has been circling,\" he wrote. \"I recently underwent a preventative medical procedure, planned in advance with my medical team. The procedure was successful, and I am well. I did not suffer a heart attack. \"I am recovering well, and looking forward to returning to full fitness and resuming my professional and personal commitments soon. \"I sincerely thank everyone for the messages of support, care, and concern. I would like to reassure everyone that there is no cause for concern. \"My heartfelt thanks go to the entire medical team who took care of me.\" Carlos won four La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues across 527 appearances for Real Madrid, and lifted the World Cup with Brazil in 2002. Renowned as a free-kick specialist, his other clubs included Palmeiras, Inter Milan, Fenerbahce and Corinthians. Related topics - Published17 October 2025 - Published16 August 2025",

    "content_clean": "Eight men's footballers hoping for a big 2026 - Published Footballers across the globe will be hoping for a big year for a multitude of reasons. They can range from impressing their new clubs, hoping for transfers, World Cup dreams and returning from injury frustrations to trying to win a first trophy. BBC Sport has a look at some players from leagues in Britain and abroad who really fancy having a 2026 to remember. Antoine Semenyo Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo is close to joining Manchester City after they activated a \u00a365m release clause in his contract. The 25-year-old is likely to complete the move after making a final appearance for the Cherries in Saturday's game against his soon-to-be-club's title rivals Arsenal. Most of the big-spending clubs in the Premier League had been interested in the Ghana international after he became one of the stars of the 2025-26 season. Semenyo is the third top scorer in the league with nine goals, plus has three assists. And now the former Bristol City man will finally have the opportunity to play in Europe - and the Champions League. But the question is - and this is why Semenyo is facing a big 2026 - how quickly can he break into the City XI with so much competition for attacking places? Troy Parrott AZ Alkmaar striker Troy Parrott will be looking to continue his international heroics in 2026. His five goals in four days against Portugal and Hungary got the Republic of Ireland to March's World Cup play-offs. But it is a big year for the 23-year-old ex-Tottenham man at club level too. He has scored 16 goals in 22 games for AZ this season, leading to suggestions he could be on his way back to one of Europe's top leagues. Nico O'Reilly Manchester City's Nico O'Reilly is an attacking midfielder by trade - but his hopes of going to the World Cup with England probably rely on him continuing to play at left-back. The 20-year-old played the Three Lions' final two World Cup qualifiers at left-back - his first two caps - having played in that position for City in Rayan Ait-Nouri's absence. He seemed to have kept his City place in that spot after Ait-Nouri's return from injury and with the Algerian now at the Africa Cup of Nations - O'Reilly has longer to cement that role. Eli Junior Kroupi Can French teenager Eli Junior Kroupi build on his electric start to life in the Premier League? His first four Premier League goals came at an average of 64 minutes per goal goal, even better than Erling Haaland was managing at that stage. The goals stopped flowing quite so much after that, but with five goals in the first half of his debut Premier League season the 19-year-old will turn heads if he can maintain this form. Harvey Elliott Harvey Elliott needs to start playing games of football. The 22-year-old moved from Liverpool to Aston Villa on loan, with an obligation to buy if he plays in 10 Premier League games. But that seems unlikely to happen - and he has dropped out of contention entirely. His last game was on 2 October, almost three months ago. Unfortunately for Elliott he cannot join another team in January because he played for Liverpool in August - so he either needs to try to break into the Villa team or go back to Anfield and try to play there. Yoane Wissa It might seem strange to put a striker who cost \u00a355m last summer on this list, but Yoane Wissa could do with a big 2026. An injury on international duty for DR Congo ruled Wissa out until making his Newcastle debut on 6 December. But the 29-year-old seems to be making up for lost time - and has scored in his first two Toon starts. Ex-Brentford man Wissa had never played in Europe before this season, so will really want to prove himself at the top level now that he is back. Igor Thiago Could Brentford striker Igor Thiago play himself into Brazil's World Cup squad? The 24-year-old has never won a cap at any age level, or even been in a senior squad, but he has 11 Premier League goals - only behind Erling Haaland. If he ends up hitting 20, could Carlo Ancelotti ignore him? And could the Bees keep him? Claudio Braga Uncapped Portuguese forward Claudio Braga has been one of the key attacking players in Hearts' remarkable challenge for the Scottish Premiership table. The 26-year-old, a summer signing from Norwegian second-tier side Aalesunds, has scored eight goals in the league so far. He had never played in a top flight before this season. Now could he help them achieve the seemingly impossible and win the Scottish title? Related topics - Published17 October 2025 - Published16 August 2025",

Two trains collided on the single track leading to the ancient Inca town on Tuesday, according to a statement from the local government. It said that 20 ambulances had attended the scene and that injured people had been transferred to medical facilities in the nearby city of Cusco. The US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured in the crash, while the UK Foreign Office said it was \"supporting a number of British nationals involved\". Local media outlet Peru21 reports that hundreds of tourists remain at the scene awaiting evacuation, which has been hampered by difficult terrain around the crash site. At least 20 of the injured are in a serious condition, a health official told the Reuters news agency. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes. The two trains involved in the accident were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively. \"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident. The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear. The crash comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process. The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative due to its limited accessibility. Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World. Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the Inca trail with a registered tour operator. In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about overtourism.",

It added that \"even in the past their combined contribution amounted to only about 1% of the total aid volume\".\nThe diaspora affairs ministry said the primary reason INGOs had their licences revoked was \"the refusal to provide complete and verifiable information regarding their employees,\" which it said was critical to preventing \"the infiltration of terrorist operatives into humanitarian structures\".\nFewer than 15% of the INGOs providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza were found to be in violation of the new regulatory framework, it added.\nThat framework includes several grounds for rejection, including:\n- Denying the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state\n- Denying the Holocaust or the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023\n- Supporting an armed struggle against Israel by an enemy state or terrorist organisation\n- Promoting \"delegitimisation campaigns\" against Israel\n- Calling for a boycott of Israel or committing to participate in one\n- Supporting the prosecution of Israeli security forces in foreign or international courts\nThe ministry of diaspora affairs also alleged that Israeli investigations had \"determined that individuals affiliated with [M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res] were linked to terrorist organisations, including the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas\", without providing any evidence.\n\"Despite repeated requests, the organisation failed to provide full disclosure regarding the identities and roles of these individuals,\" it said.\nMSF said it took such allegations extremely seriously and that it would \"never knowingly employ people engaging in military activity\".\n\"Any employee who engages in military activity would pose a danger to our staff and our patients. Publicly making such claims without substantiated evidence puts humanitarian staff at risk and undermines life-saving medical work,\" it added.\nMSF also warned that deregistration by Israeli authorities would effectively block it from operating in Gaza, \"where we support one in five hospital beds and one in three births, cutting off life-saving medical assistance for hundreds of thousands of people\".\nNorwegian Refugee Council spokeswoman Shaina Low told NPR that it would no longer be able to bring foreign aid workers into Gaza if it was deregistered, but that its 200 local staff would continue to support communities as best as they could.\nMs Low said NRC had tried to explain to the Israeli authorities why it could not provide them with lists of their Palestinian staff members.\n\"We've seen that hundreds of aid workers were killed over the last two years. And so, for us, it is a safety concern for our staff. And acknowledging who they are - it puts them at risk. Because we've seen that aid workers are just as unprotected, and at times, have been targeted by Israeli authorities,\" she said.\nShe also said that the NRC and other INGOs were prevented by data protection laws from complying with an Israeli demand to share details about the funding they received from the EU and EU member states.\n\"The number one thing that we're concerned about is the entry of aid,\" she added. \"We continue to call for Israel to lift these restrictions, to open all of the crossings to allow much more aid to enter than the current rate.\"\nIsrael says it is meeting its obligations in facilitating an increase in aid deliveries.\nOn 19 December, UN-backed food security experts said there had been improvements in nutrition and food supplies in Gaza since the ceasefire began, but that 100,000 people still experienced \"catastrophic conditions\" last month.\nOther INGOs to be suspended include CARE, Medico International, and Medical Aid for Palestinians.\nInternational Rescue Committee said it was in touch with relevant authorities and seeking a way to sustain the delivery of life-saving aid.\nBushra Khalidi, Oxfam's policy lead, meanwhile said Cogat's figures on aid deliveries by the affected INGOs were misleading because \"humanitarian impact is not measured by percentages\".\n\"We are not simply aid volume contributors; we are core implementers. The UN relies on our staff, our partners, our technical expertise, our logistics, and our community networks to deliver assistance,\" she explained.\nThe Humanitarian Country Team of the Occupied Palestinian Territory - a forum that brings together UN agencies and more than 200 local and international NGOs - urged the Israeli authorities to reconsider the registration decisions.\nEarlier this month, it complained that the new registration system relied on \"vague, arbitrary, and highly politicised criteria and imposes requirements that humanitarian organisations cannot meet without violating international legal obligations or compromising core humanitarian principles\".\nIn a statement, Israel's Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Amichai Chikli, said: \"The message is clear: humanitarian assistance is welcome - the exploitation of humanitarian frameworks for terrorism is not.\"\nThe war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam's policy lead, meanwhile said Cogat's figures on aid deliveries by the affected INGOs were misleading because \"humanitarian impact is not measured by percentages\". \"We are not simply aid volume contributors; we are core implementers. The UN relies on our staff, our partners, our technical expertise, our logistics, and our community networks to deliver assistance,\" she explained. The Humanitarian Country Team of the Occupied Palestinian Territory - a forum that brings together UN agencies and more than 200 local and international NGOs - urged the Israeli authorities to reconsider the registration decisions. Earlier this month, it complained that the new registration system relied on \"vague, arbitrary, and highly politicised criteria and imposes requirements that humanitarian organisations cannot meet without violating international legal obligations or compromising core humanitarian principles\". In a statement, Israel's Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Amichai Chikli, said: \"The message is clear: humanitarian assistance is welcome - the exploitation of humanitarian frameworks for terrorism is not.\" The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "content": "Huge crowds mourn Bangladesh's first female PM at state funeral\nHundreds of thousands of people travelled from across Bangladesh to the capital Dhaka on Wednesday to pay their final respects to former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.\nZia, who was the country's first female prime minister, died on Tuesday from a prolonged illness.

    "content_clean": "Huge crowds mourn Bangladesh's first female PM at state funeral Hundreds of thousands of people travelled from across Bangladesh to the capital Dhaka on Wednesday to pay their final respects to former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. Zia, who was the country's first female prime minister, died on Tuesday from a prolonged illness. She was 80. The mourners held out their hands in prayer and carried flags printed with her photographs as a motorcade carrying Zia's body - including the hearse wrapped with the national flag - drove on streets near the parliament house. Flags were flown at half-mast and thousands of security officers were deployed. \"I have come this far just to say goodbye. I know I won't be able to see her face, but at least I could see the [vehicle] carrying her for the last rites,\" Setara Sultana, an activist from Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), told the BBC. Sharmina Siraj, a mother of two, called Zia \"an inspiration\", noting that stipends introduced by the former leader to improve women's education made a \"huge impact\" on her daughters. \"It is difficult to imagine women in leadership positions anytime soon,\" she told AFP news agency. India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, the Speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Bhutan's Foreign Minister Lyonpo DN Dhungyel were among those who attended the funeral. Earlier in the day, Zia's body was taken to the house of her son Tarique Rahman, who was seen reciting the Quran beside his mother's office. The state funeral marks the end of Zia's extraordinary journey, from a homemaker to the first female prime minister of Bangladesh. Zia was be buried next to her husband Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981 while serving as president - an incident that thrusted Zia into the political limelight. She went on to lead the BNP in the country's first elections in 20 years. She was dubbed an \"uncompromising leader\" after refusing to participate in a controversial election under military ruler General Hussain Muhammad Ershad in the 1980s. For several years, along with her bitter political rival Sheikh Hasina, she fought for democracy and against military dictatorship, enduring arrests. There was talk among Bangladesh's rulers at the time to keep the two \"battling begums\" - Zia and Hasina - out of politics in what was then known as the \"minus two formula\". But Zia eventually became prime minister, first in 1991 then again in 2001. During the time of the military-backed caretaker government in 2007, she was kept under detention. In the last 16 years, under Hasnina's Awami League government, Zia emerged as the most prominent symbol of resistance to Hasina's rule which many saw as increasingly autocratic. Zia's resilience drew admiration from her supporters, who say that despite various personal and political setbacks, years in opposition and convictions under Hasina's government, Zia never gave up, refused to compromise on her principles and stood her ground. The fact that hundreds of thousands of people, including those who didn't vote for her party, turned up for the funeral would be seen as a reflection of her popularity among the masses. Those who worked with her recall a leader who asked probing questions while making key decisions.

    "content_clean": "Eurostar services return to normal after major Channel Tunnel disruption Eurostar and Le Shuttle services between the UK and France have resumed through the Channel Tunnel after major travel disruption on Tuesday. Thousands of passengers faced hours of delays after Eurostar cancelled most of its London to Europe services due to overhead power supply problem and a failed Le Shuttle train which blocked all routes. Repair work took place overnight and rail services through the tunnel in both directions resumed on Wednesday morning. But Eurostar urged passengers to check before travelling as it warned for possible knock-on delays and last-minute cancellations. Most of Eurostar's Wednesday morning services in and out of London St Pancras have departed. Only three - one towards Paris Gare du Nord; another destined for Brussels Midi and the other bound for Amsterdam Centraal- have been cancelled, according to Eurostar's website. The high-speed rail firm apologised for any inconvenience caused to passengers. Eurostar said: \"We plan to run all of our services today, however due to knock on impacts there may still be some delays and possible last-minute cancellations. \"Customers are advised to check for live updates on the status of their train on the Eurostar website.\" Eurostar said one extra London to Paris service will run on Wednesday and that passengers are entitled to \"enhanced compensation\" which includes 100% refund of their ticket and 150% of their ticket price as an e-voucher. Le Shuttle services from Folkestone are running normally following earlier delays on Wednesday morning. However, there are still delays of an hour at Calais - although down from the earlier reported six hours. The Channel Tunnel accommodates Eurostar services as well as Le Shuttle vehicle-carrying trains between the UK and France. Getlink, which operates the Channel Tunnel, said work continued through the night to fix the power issue. The problem with the overhead power supply and the broken down Le Shuttle train blocked all routes on Tuesday. It caused travel disruption for thousands trying to get away for New Year's Eve as the majority of Eurostar trains from London to Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels were cancelled. Images of massive crowds of travellers stranded at London St Pancras International flooded social media following Tuesday's power outage. Cars that had hoped to use the Channel Tunnel caused traffic jams near Le Shuttle's Terminal in Folkestone. Some Eurostar and Le Shuttle services were able to resume on Tuesday evening, but delays remained as only one of the Channel Tunnel's two rail lines were open. However, some passengers were stuck on board trains overnight. Dennis Van Der Steen boarded a train for Amsterdam, which departed London St Pancras at 20:49 on Tuesday. But before the train reached the Eurostar tunnel, it came to a stop. After a six-hour wait at the entrance to the tunnel the service turned back to London.

The two West African states were recently placed under full entry restrictions under US President Donald Trump's expanded travel ban. In separate statements, they said they would apply the same measures on US nationals. Burkina Faso's foreign affairs minister Karamoko Jean-Marie Traor\u00e9 said his government was acting on the \"principle of reciprocity\", while Mali's foreign ministry called for \"mutual respect and sovereign equality\". The latter said it regretted the US's move, adding that \"such an important decision was made without any prior consultation\". Mali and Burkina Faso's decision comes days after Niger's state news agency reported that Niger had imposed a similar travel ban on US citizens, though no official statement has been issued by its foreign ministry to confirm this. The three countries are ruled by military juntas which seized power in coups. They have formed their own regional bloc, and have pivoted towards Russia after relations with other West African states and Western powers became strained. Earlier this month, the White House said that full-entry restrictions would be imposed on people from the three countries, as well as South Sudan, Syria and Palestinian Authority passport holders. The decision would come into effect on 1 January, and was intended to \"protect the security\" of the US, it said. The administration also moved Laos and Sierra Leone, which were previously subject to partial restrictions, to the full ban list, and put partial restrictions on 15 other countries, including Nigeria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. The White House said the restrictions would remain in place until affected countries show \"credible improvements\" in identity management, information-sharing and cooperation with US immigration authorities. A number of exceptions apply and the ban will not affect lawful permanent residents, many existing visa holders, diplomats, or athletes travelling for major sporting events. Officials said case-by-case waivers would also be available where travel is deemed to be in the national interest.

    "content": "US stock market ends 2025 on a high note after volatile year\nIt's been a roller-coaster year for financial markets - but US stock investors are heading into 2026 on a high note.\nUS President Donald Trump's global trade tariffs sent shockwaves through markets in the spring. But by summer, the US saw record highs fuelled by strong company profits and confidence in artificial intelligence investments.\nThe S&P 500 index is on track to end the year up about 17%, the third consecutive year of double-digit gains.\nNext year could shape up to be yet another big one for stock investors, analysts say. Still, with leadership changes at the US central bank and mounting concerns that AI stocks are overvalued, the path ahead might be bumpy.\nThe technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is poised for a 21% gain this year, while the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies is roughly 12% higher year-to-date.\nIn early April, when Trump announced sweeping tariffs on US trading partners, the S&P 500 fell to the brink of bear market territory - Wall Street's term for a drop of 20% from the latest high. Both the Nasdaq Composite and Russell 2000 indexes did briefly tumble into bear markets.\nBut major indexes quickly bounced back after Trump walked back his steepest tariffs, easing Wall Street's fears about a tariff-driven economic slowdown.\nStocks have since surged to new highs.\nThat's been in spite of persistent jitters about the economy, Robert Edwards, chief investment officer at Edwards Asset Management, said in a note.\n\"The market continues to climb the wall of worry into next year,\" he said.\nHe added that 2026 \"should be another year of record setting for stocks\", pointing in part to expectations for lower borrowing costs, which could boost corporate earnings and drive stock prices higher.\nStrong earnings growth in corporate America has been a key driver of the stock market rally since the tariff-driven whiplash in the spring, said Parag Thatte, an equity strategist at Deutsche Bank.\nAt the same time, geopolitical tensions, Trump's tariffs and expectations of interest rate cuts added to investor demand this year for safe haven assets, such as gold and other commodities. The price of gold is on track for a nearly 70% yearly increase.\nBitcoin, on the other hand, has struggled to keep up with strong returns across stocks and gold.\nDespite getting a boost earlier in the year from the Trump administration's support for digital assets, the world's largest cryptocurrency is poised to end 2025 slightly lower, after a sharp decline from its record highs in October.\nBroadening beyond tech\nEnthusiasm among investors about massive AI spending has helped several tech firms outperform the broader S&P 500.\nThe top five companies - Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet - make up almost 30% of the overall index.\nBut in recent months, fears have mounted in Silicon Valley and beyond of an AI bubble bursting, as the values of tech companies linked to AI have soared and companies keep spending big on the burgeoning industry.\nAnalysts note that corporate earnings growth appears to be broadening out beyond the tech sector. That could offer investors a cushion, as tech company valuations remain under intense scrutiny.\nMr Thatte, with Deutsche Bank, said growth picked up for average-sized companies in the third quarter of 2025, not just for tech giants. He called this a \"key development\".\nBut even with increasingly broad gains across the US stock market, whether the S&P 500 can maintain its momentum if the tech sector's rally were to slow remains to be seen.\n\"The rotation is already happening,\" Mr Thatte said, referring to investors pivoting away from Big Tech stocks. \"It might be noisy along the way.\"\nThere are also ongoing concerns among professional investors that some stocks outside of tech are overvalued, too.\nAnalysts at Vanguard predict annualized returns of about 3.5% to 5.5% for US stocks over the next decade - a relatively subdued outlook, compared to recent gains.\nPolicy risk is 'not subsiding'\nIn 2025, the US economy \"probably held up better than most people had expected,\" said David Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar.\nThe world's largest economy picked up speed over the three months to September, expanding at an annual rate of 4.3%, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter - the strongest growth in two years.\nBut that's not to say there aren't big economic question marks in the months ahead.\nThere's still the possibility that Trump tariff policies could prompt another jolt to markets. Negotations between Washington and major trading partners will be \"an ongoing headline\", Mr Sekera said.\nThe US labour market has also shown signs of weakness. The unemployment rate rose to a four-year high of 4.6% in November, up from 4.4% in September, according to Labor Department figures.\n\"With policy risk not subsiding anytime soon,\" analysts at Charles Schwab wrote in a research note, \"the bar for a pullback or mini correction in the beginning of 2026 is not terribly high.\"\nTrump is also expected to name a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming weeks, to succeed Jerome Powell after his term ends in May.\nThe decision is \"the big uncertainty\" for investors heading into 2026, Paul Stanley, chief investment officer at Granite Bay Wealth Management, said in a note.\nTrump, who has been pressuring Powell to lower interest rates, has said he will pick a Fed chair who he views as committed to easing borrowing costs.\nWall Street investors will be focused on understanding how the change in leadership will impact monetary policy moving forward.\n\"Fed chair transitions come with volatility,\" Mr Stanley said.\nThat leaves investors facing down plenty of unpredictability, even as analysts anticipate another strong year ahead.",

Another good indicator signaling that your mattress is likely to no longer provide adequate support is if you consistently wake up with back, neck, hip or shoulder pain that wasn't there before. An old mattress can accumulate dust mites, mold and allergens, leading to increased allergy symptoms.\nWhat is the best mattress to buy?\nChoosing the best mattress depends on individual needs and preferences. Side sleepers generally do better with a softer to medium-firm mattress that contours to their body to relieve pressure on hips and shoulders and maintain spinal alignment. Back sleepers may prefer a medium to firm mattress that provides consistent support to keep the neck, shoulders and torso aligned. Stomach sleepers should opt for a firmer mattress to prevent their hips from sinking too far, which can lead to back pain.\nIf you\u2019re an Amazon Prime member, you can get these items sent to your door ASAP.

Daniels to get another first down with under two minutes to play. Brown scored with 55 seconds left to deliver the final blow. Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin threw an interception on their final drive. It was a hard-fought game with both teams delivering big hits after big hits. The Hurricanes finally broke through in the second quarter when Beck faked a run and found Fletcher for a short pass. Fletcher ran the ball for a touchdown to go up 7-0 early. On the next drive, Keionte Scott picked off Sayin and returned the interception for a touchdown. Ohio State missed a field goal before halftime and Miami went to the locker room with a 14-0 lead. Ohio State would claw back. ARCH MANNING'S 60-YARD TOUCHDOWN RUN DELIVERS CRITICAL BLOW IN TEXAS' WIN OVER MICHIGAN Sayin started the third quarter with an 11-play, 82-yard drive that took nearly seven minutes off the clock. It ended with a Bo Jackson touchdown. Ohio State followed up with a touchdown on a Jeremiah Smith catch on the next drive to cut the deficit to three points following a Miami field goal. Ohio State punted on its next drive and then turned the ball over on its final drive. Beck changed the game with his legs as much as he did as a passer. Ohio State was forced to respect his ability to take off with the football. He had 23 yards but made a few clutch plays with his feet. He was 19-of-26 through the air with 138 passing yards and a touchdown pass. Fletcher, despite turning the ball over in the first quarter, ran the ball for 90 yards on 19 carries. Brown started to get carries late in the game and scored the crucial touchdown in the end. Ohio State allowed more than 20 points in a game for the first time since their national championship win against Notre Dame back on Jan. 20. The defense was able to do enough to knock Sayin off his game. Sayin had two interceptions in the game and was sacked five times.

    "content": "China will begin charging a 13% value-added tax on contraceptives starting Jan. 1 while exempting childcare services from the same tax, a move authorities say is part of a broader effort to boost births as the country faces a sustained population decline, according to the BBC and The Associated Press.\nThe tax overhaul, announced late last year, removes exemptions that had been in place since 1994, when China was still enforcing its decades-long one-child policy.\nAlongside the new tax on contraceptives such as condoms and birth control pills, the Chinese government is exempting childcare, marriage-related services and elderly care from the value-added tax (VAT), the BBC reported.\nBeijing has been pressing young people to marry and have children as it grapples with an aging population and a sluggish economy. Official figures show China\u2019s population has shrunk for three consecutive years with about 9.54 million babies born in 2024.\nWHY GEN Z DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE KIDS\nThat figure is roughly half the number of births recorded a decade earlier, when China began easing limits on family size, according to national statistics cited by the BBC and the AP.\nChina\u2019s population pressures have been mounting for years. Births fell from about 14.7 million in 2019 to roughly 9.5 million in 2024. In 2023, India officially overtook China as the world\u2019s most populous country.\nThe new tax on contraceptives has drawn ridicule and concern inside China. On social media, some users joked about stockpiling condoms before prices rise, while others argued that the cost of contraception is insignificant compared with the expense of raising a child, the BBC reported.\n\"I have one child, and I don\u2019t want any more,\" Daniel Luo, a 36-year-old resident of Henan province, told the BBC. He said the price increase would not change his family plans, comparing it to small hikes in subway fares that do not alter daily behavior.\nOthers worry the policy could have unintended consequences. Rosy Zhao, who lives in the central city of Xi\u2019an, told the BBC making contraception more expensive could lead students or people under financial strain to take risks. She called that the policy\u2019s most dangerous potential outcome.\nA SOLUTION TO THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM: MARRIAGE\nHealth experts echoed those concerns in interviews with the AP, warning that higher prices could reduce access to contraception and contribute to more unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. China recorded more than 670,000 cases of syphilis and over 100,000 cases of gonorrhea in 2024, according to data from the National Disease Control and Prevention Administration.\nChina has also reported some of the highest abortion numbers in the world. Between 2014 and 2021, authorities recorded between 9 million and 10 million abortions annually, according to the National Health Commission. China stopped publishing abortion data in 2022.\nDemographers and policy analysts remain skeptical that taxing contraceptives will meaningfully raise birth rates. Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, told the BBC the idea that higher condom prices would influence fertility decisions amounts to overthinking the policy.\nValue-added tax revenue, which totaled close to $1 trillion last year, accounts for about 40% of China\u2019s tax collection, according to figures cited by the BBC.\nHenrietta Levin of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) described the move as symbolic, reflecting Beijing\u2019s attempt to lift what she called strikingly low fertility numbers. She also cautioned that many incentives and subsidies depend on provincial governments that are already heavily indebted, raising questions about whether they can fund the measures adequately.\nJAPAN REJECTS SAME-SEX MARRIAGE TO SAVE ITSELF FROM DEMOGRAPHIC COLLAPSE\nPublic health experts interviewed by the AP said the policy could disproportionately affect women, who shoulder most responsibility for birth control in China. Research released by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2022 found condoms are used by about 9% of couples, while 44.2% rely on intrauterine devices and 30.5% on female sterilization. Male sterilization accounts for 4.7%.\nSome women say the tax revives resentment toward the government\u2019s long history of involvement in reproductive decisions. The Communist Party enforced the one-child policy from roughly 1980 until 2015 through fines, penalties and, in some cases, forced abortions, according to the AP. Children born outside the policy were sometimes denied household registration, effectively rendering them non-citizens.\n\"It is a disciplinary tactic, a management of women\u2019s bodies and my sexual desire,\" Zou Xuan, a 32-year-old teacher in Jiangxi province, told the AP.\nConcerns about further state intrusion have also surfaced in recent months. The BBC reported that women in some provinces have received calls from local officials asking about menstrual cycles and pregnancy plans. A health bureau in Yunnan province said the information was needed to identify expectant mothers, a move critics say risks alienating the very families Beijing hopes to encourage.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nLevin warned that such approaches could damage public trust. She told the BBC, \"The [Communist] party can't help but insert itself into every decision that it cares about. So, it ends up being its own worst enemy in some ways.\"\nWhile the government is adjusting policies once used to limit population growth, experts caution that reversing decades-long demographic trends will be much more difficult than increasing prices at the checkout counter, especially after years of policies that shaped whether families could have children.",

The Hurricanes took a two-score lead with a clever touchdown pass from Carson Beck and a pick-six from Keionte Scott. On social media, college football fans were upset with a different issue. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The ESPN score bug appeared to distract viewers, and they let it be known on X. As teams pick up first downs in the game, the middle part of the bug flashes a gold indicator to signify the accomplishment. But college football fans were irked that it looked like a penalty flag was thrown on the play. There were no penalties called in the first half of the game as Miami took a 14-0 lead into the locker room. ARCH MANNING'S 60-YARD TOUCHDOWN RUN DELIVERS CRITICAL BLOW IN TEXAS' WIN OVER MICHIGAN Beck found Mark Fletcher Jr. for a 9-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter. The score rectified Fletcher\u2019s fumble from the previous possession. Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin tried to respond with a touchdown of his own. Instead, Sayin threw an interception to Scott, who returned the ball for a touchdown. The Buckeyes were moving the ball well on their final drive of the half. It appeared Sayin was finally starting to find his rhythm. The drive ended with a missed 49-yard field goal attempt.

She\u2019s a podcaster and bourbon insider.\nTARIFFS PUSH US WINE INDUSTRY INTO UNCERTAIN TERRITORY: 'REALLY CREATES A CHALLENGE'\n\"Bourbon is Kentucky, right? We love horse racing in Kentucky. We love bourbon in Kentucky. It's the reason that 2.7 million people come to visit the Commonwealth every single year,\" said Coffey. \"It\u2019s some of the biggest news to come out of Kentucky in quite some time, and this is one of the most iconic brands in bourbon.\"\nNot everyone has heard of Willett or Four Roses when it comes to bourbon. But Jim Beam is Americana. Ubiquitous. Kind of like McDonald\u2019s or Coke.\nAmericans are imbibing less \u2014 down 6% from just two years ago. And more than 16 million barrels of Kentucky spirits \u2014 including bourbon and rye \u2014 are aging in warehouses across the state. Distillers are paying taxes on those barrels while they age.\nIt\u2019s an issue of supply and demand. But the problem is not exclusive to Jim Beam.\n\"It's not a question of who's shutting down production,\" said Charlie Prince, who runs the Drammers Whiskey Club. \"It's a question of who is admitting it.\"\nOverseas distillers like Midleton in Ireland, which makes Jameson, and Highland Park in Scotland all reduced production recently because of a glut of bourbon, whiskey and Scotch on the market.\nHowever, observers say tariffs and the trade war with Canada hit Jim Beam especially hard.\n\"Ten percent of Kentucky bourbon sales were going to Canada, and that has dropped to almost zero,\" said Prince. \"In Canada, that has been taken on as a kind of a national mission for Canadians, saying, \u2018Let's buy Canadian\u2019 and push back against the politics they don't like coming from the U.S. And, so, you see stores just pulling all American products and banning them in some provinces. So, that's definitely a political response.\"\nDemocrats quickly latched onto the tariff argument.\n\"Thousands of Kentuckians power the bourbon industry. We will all feel the impact of this,\" declared Rep. Morgan McGarvey, D-Ky. \"It\u2019s hard to overstate just how devastating Trump\u2019s tariffs are for America\u2019s signature spirit.\"\nRECORD LOW NUMBER OF AMERICANS REPORT DRINKING ALCOHOL, AND NEW TEETOTALERS ARE EXPLAINING WHY\nBut one industry observer believes that tariffs are a single ingredient in a complex economic cocktail. Jessica Spector is a professor at Yale who studies the history and culture of liquor and spirits.\n\"Anybody that tells you that they have an explanation, \u2018Oh, it's tariffs,\u2019 or 'Oh, it's post-pandemic retraction,\u2019 is giving you a too simplistic explanation,\" said Spector. \"It's unclear what impact the tariffs are having and will have in the future. People have argued over tariffs for a long time. As long as there has been trade, there have been arguments over tariffs. It's unclear whether the tariffs are sort of the coup de gras to an industry that was already suffering.\"\nSpector says yes, Generation Z drinks less and uses cannabis more. There are also health concerns. But the spirits industry has witnessed shifts before. She says people moved from brown liquor to vodka in the 1970s because it was seen as healthier.\n\"They also jogged more and did a lot more cocaine because that was seen as more health conscious. So, it gets really complicated when you break things down generationally,\" said Spector.\nBut the tariffs remain extraordinarily controversial. The Trump administration says tariffs are here to stay.\n\"Tariffs are going to be part of the policy landscape,\" United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Fox. \"We know they\u2019re successful.\"\nBut the tariffs may also evaporate.\nThe Constitution grants Congress the authority to tax and impose tariffs. President Trump used emergency powers to levy global tariffs earlier this year. That\u2019s why this issue wound up at the Supreme Court. Attorneys argued the case in October.\n\"Canada is one of our closest allies. I think it would be hard to find Canada engaging in unfair trade practices because we have what used to be called the NAFTA agreement, between Canada, the United States and Mexico to bring down all the trade barriers between the countries,\" said University of California law professor John Yoo.\nBased on the oral arguments, Yoo believes the high court will halt the Trump-imposed tariffs under the premise that the U.S. faces a national emergency.\n\"Canada will immediately benefit, and you'll be able to find your choice of American bourbons on Canadian store shelves,\" said Yoo.\nFREEDOM AND FACTS, NOT FEAR, SHOULD FRAME AMERICA'S CHOICES ON ALCOHOL\nIn fact, Yoo believes the Supreme Court could issue its ruling sooner rather than later \u2014 especially if it nixes the tariffs. That\u2019s because of all the duties and fees that might be levied on products for months \u2014 and then reversed.\nIt\u2019s important to note that Jim Beam will continue operating two other distilleries for the time being. And Spector says Generation Z prefers cocktails. So, that could force the industry to shift what it produces.\nNow here\u2019s a little tidbit you probably won\u2019t learn any place else.\nRoam any distillery in Scotland, be it Dalwhinnie in the Highlands, Glen Scotia in Campbeltown, GlenGrant in Speyside or Bowmore on Islay, and you will find distillers aging Scotch in Jim Beam barrels.\nIt\u2019s not just Jim Beam barrels that you will find in Scotland. It\u2019s also Buffalo Trace. Heaven Hill. Woodford Reserve. Wild Turkey. Congress only allows American distillers to use American oak barrels once for producing bourbon. So, Scotch distillers overseas love to get their hands on a good bourbon barrel to age their spirit.\nThe barrels may partially impart a vanilla flavor into the expression, stemming from \"vanillans\" in the wood.\nThe trend of using American bourbon barrels for Scotch began in the 1940s after the U.S. market came back online following the end of Prohibition. Distillers in Scotland began using sherry barrels to age their spirits prior to that (hence, the rich meaty flavors you get from Macallan). Sherry is still prevalent despite a decline in people consuming sherry these days. But fewer bourbon barrels from a big producer like Jim Beam now could alter the taste of Scotch in about 15 to 20 years.\nThat said, demand for Scotch is down like bourbon. So, some of these may even out.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Suntory Global Spirits owns Jim Beam. It was known as Beam Suntory until recently. Suntory also owns major Scotch labels like Bowmore, Admore, Laphroaig, Auchentoshan and Glen Garioch. The pipeline of barrels from Jim Beam was a good proposition for Suntory to age Scotch.\nSo, it\u2019s possible that, down the road, Scotch distillers may age some of their expressions in barrels that once contained something else \u2014 other than Kentucky bourbon. And that\u2019s where the flavor profile will evolve.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIt\u2019s also impossible to know the market trends and what people will be interested in drinking in 15 to 20 years. And, so, whatever distillers put into a barrel now might not match market trends in the future.\nIn fact, perhaps people will revert to drinking bourbon and Scotch. And the market glut now may switch into a spirits famine where products consumers want are hard to find.",

    "content_clean": "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry on Wednesday released nighttime video footage it claimed shows the wreckage of a Ukrainian drone intercepted during an attempted attack on a residence used by President Vladimir Putin. The video, filmed in a snow-covered, forested area in Russia, shows a Russian serviceman standing over debris that Moscow said belongs to a Ukrainian-made Chaklun-V drone. Russian officials also said the drone was shot down before it could strike Putin\u2019s residence near Lake Valdai in the Novgorod region and was carrying a six-kilogram explosive device that failed to detonate. The footage was released as Moscow faced mounting skepticism over its account of events. PUTIN REJECTS KEY PARTS OF US PEACE PLAN AS KREMLIN OFFICIAL WARNS EUROPE FACES NEW WAR RISK: REPORT The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that U.S. national security officials concluded Ukraine did not target Putin or any of his residences in the alleged drone incident. The Journal said the finding was supported by a CIA assessment that determined no attempted attack on Putin occurred, citing a U.S. official briefed on the intelligence. Instead, Ukraine, they said, was believed to be targeting a military site it had previously struck in the same region but not near Putin\u2019s residence, the official said. Ukrainian officials have continued to reject the allegations, with a military drone expert claiming the video provided little evidence of an attempted strike on one of Russia\u2019s most heavily secured locations. UKRAINE SAYS IT CARRIED OUT FIRST-EVER UNDERWATER DRONE STRIKE ON RUSSIAN SUBMARINE IN NOVOROSSIYSK \"This footage, unfortunately, does not offer proof of anything other than that there is a wrecked drone on the ground somewhere being stood over by a Russian serviceman,\" Draganfly CEO Cameron Chell told Fox News Digital. Chell, whose firm supplies drones to the U.S. Department of Defense and its allies, said the drone shown in the video looked ill-suited for such a mission. \"The attacks that occurred on Dec. 29 were also hundreds of kilometers away,\" he added. \"The engines on the drone in this new footage are very small, and though capable of multiple hours of flight with the type of fixed-wing drone displayed, it would be extremely slow and unsophisticated. \"This drone is not untypical of many Ukraine drones, but these would only be used for infrastructure targets and woefully ineffective in an attack on a facility the likes of Putin\u2019s residence,\" Chell concluded. PUTIN SAYS RUSSIA WON'T LAUNCH NEW ATTACKS ON OTHER COUNTRIES 'IF YOU TREAT US WITH RESPECT' Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi also dismissed the footage as \"laughable,\" saying Kyiv was \"absolutely confident that no such attack took place,\" according to Reuters. Russia alleges the drone was part of a broader Ukrainian operation targeting Putin\u2019s residence earlier this week. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov asserted 91 drones had been intercepted en route to Putin\u2019s residence, a figure that appeared to conflict with earlier Defense Ministry statements. The ministry initially reported that 89 drones were shot down across eight regions, including 18 over Novgorod, before revising the numbers upward. RUSSIA ALLEGES ATTACK ON PUTIN RESIDENCE AS UKRAINE DENIES CLAIM AHEAD OF TRUMP TALKS Only after Lavrov\u2019s remarks did the Defense Ministry claim that 49 drones intercepted over Bryansk \u2014 nearly 300 miles from Valdai \u2014 were also targeting the presidential residence. The ministry initially reported that 89 drones were shot down across eight regions, including 18 over Novgorod, before revising the numbers upward. The timing of the allegations has also drawn scrutiny, coming shortly after what Moscow described publicly as a positive meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Florida. Zelenskyy also called the alleged drone attack a \"complete fabrication,\" saying it was designed to justify further Russian strikes and undermine diplomatic efforts.

The operations followed Operation Hawkeye Strike, when U.S. and Jordanian forces hit more than 70 ISIS targets across central Syria using over 100 precision munitions, destroying infrastructure and weapons sites linked to the group.\n\"We will not relent,\" CENTCOM Commander Adm. Brad Cooper said, adding that U.S. forces remain \"steadfast\" in working with regional partners to dismantle ISIS networks that pose a threat to U.S. and regional security.\nThe scope of the follow-on raids highlights a reality U.S. commanders and analysts have been warning about for months: ISIS no longer controls large swaths of territory, but it retains the ability to organize, strike and regenerate inside Syria\u2019s fragmented security landscape.\nSYRIANS MARK FIRST YEAR SINCE ASSAD'S FALL AS US SIGNALS NEW ERA IN RELATIONS\nSyria remains divided among competing forces, militias and foreign-backed armed groups, with no single authority exercising full control over large parts of the country. Analysts say that vacuum continues to provide space for ISIS cells to operate quietly, recruit and exploit overstretched local forces.\nAnalysts note that Syria\u2019s security environment remains shaped by former jihadist networks that were never fully demobilized after the war. The country\u2019s transitional leadership, including President Ahmed al-Sharaa, emerged from armed Islamist factions that relied heavily on foreign fighters and militias, according to regional security assessments. While those groups are not synonymous with ISIS, experts say the incomplete dismantling of extremist networks has left gaps that ISIS cells continue to exploit.\n\"ISIS today doesn\u2019t need a caliphate to be dangerous,\" Bill Roggio told Fox News Digital. \"We\u2019ve always been quick to declare terrorist organizations defeated and insignificant, and that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\"\nRoggio said the group has adapted rather than disappeared, shifting away from holding territory toward smaller, more covert cells capable of carrying out lethal attacks. He pointed to ongoing ISIS activity not only in Syria and Iraq, but also in Afghanistan and other regions, citing United Nations reporting that estimates roughly 2,000 ISIS fighters remain active in Afghanistan alone.\n\"That\u2019s not what a defeated group looks like,\" Roggio said, noting that ISIS continues to recruit, indoctrinate and inspire attacks even without the visibility it once had.\nOne of the most sensitive vulnerabilities remains the network of detention facilities in northeastern Syria holding thousands of ISIS terrorists and supporters. Those prisons are guarded primarily by Kurdish-led forces backed by a small U.S. military presence, estimated at roughly 1,000 troops, according to Reuters.\nU.S. and coalition officials have repeatedly warned that any major disruption to prison security could allow hardened ISIS operatives to escape and reconstitute networks across Syria and beyond. Kurdish officials have also raised concerns about funding shortages, manpower strain and pressure from rival militias operating nearby.\nWhile U.S. officials have not publicly linked the recent strikes to prison-related threats, analysts say the broader environment of fragmented control increases the risk of coordinated attacks, insider assistance or prison unrest.\nThe danger is not theoretical. ISIS has previously staged mass prison break operations in Syria and Iraq, including a 2022 assault on the al-Sinaa prison in Hasakah that required days of fighting to contain.\nThe U.S. strikes also come amid continued instability inside Syria, where multiple armed actors operate with overlapping authority. Analysts note that clashes among militias, sectarian violence and unresolved command structures have weakened overall security and diverted attention from counterterrorism efforts.\nUS, SYRIAN TROOPS COME UNDER FIRE WHILE ON PATROL: REPORT\nBombings in neighborhoods of Damascus, including Mezzeh, and unrest in minority areas have further illustrated the gaps ISIS and other extremist groups can exploit, according to regional security assessments and open-source reporting.\n\"Syria\u2019s chaos is the accelerant,\" Roggio said. \"ISIS thrives where no one is fully in charge.\"\nU.S. officials and analysts stress that ISIS activity in Syria is part of a wider pattern rather than an isolated flare-up.\nSources in the Israeli Mossad told Fox News Digital of continued ISIS-linked activity across multiple theaters, including recruitment networks and small-scale attacks designed to test security responses and maintain operational relevance.\nIn Turkey, security forces recently clashed with Islamic State militants during counterterrorism operations, wounding several officers, according to Reuters on Monday. Turkish authorities said the raids targeted ISIS cells suspected of planning attacks inside the country.\nDEADLY STRIKE ON US TROOPS TESTS TRUMP\u2019S COUNTER-ISIS PLAN \u2014 AND HIS TRUST IN SYRIA\u2019S NEW LEADER\n\"These are signals, not spikes,\" Roggio said. \"ISIS operates across regions, adapting to pressure and exploiting weak governance wherever it finds it.\"\nThe renewed U.S. military action raises difficult questions for policymakers about how long the current containment strategy can hold.\nWhile U.S. officials say the Dec. 19 strikes delivered a significant blow to ISIS infrastructure, they have also acknowledged that counterterrorism operations alone cannot eliminate the underlying conditions that allow the group to persist.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Just because we want to declare the war against terror over doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s over,\" Roggio said. \"The enemy gets a vote.\"",

He pointed to ongoing ISIS activity not only in Syria and Iraq, but also in Afghanistan and other regions, citing United Nations reporting that estimates roughly 2,000 ISIS fighters remain active in Afghanistan alone. \"That\u2019s not what a defeated group looks like,\" Roggio said, noting that ISIS continues to recruit, indoctrinate and inspire attacks even without the visibility it once had. One of the most sensitive vulnerabilities remains the network of detention facilities in northeastern Syria holding thousands of ISIS terrorists and supporters. Those prisons are guarded primarily by Kurdish-led forces backed by a small U.S. military presence, estimated at roughly 1,000 troops, according to Reuters. U.S. and coalition officials have repeatedly warned that any major disruption to prison security could allow hardened ISIS operatives to escape and reconstitute networks across Syria and beyond. Kurdish officials have also raised concerns about funding shortages, manpower strain and pressure from rival militias operating nearby. While U.S. officials have not publicly linked the recent strikes to prison-related threats, analysts say the broader environment of fragmented control increases the risk of coordinated attacks, insider assistance or prison unrest. The danger is not theoretical. ISIS has previously staged mass prison break operations in Syria and Iraq, including a 2022 assault on the al-Sinaa prison in Hasakah that required days of fighting to contain. The U.S. strikes also come amid continued instability inside Syria, where multiple armed actors operate with overlapping authority. Analysts note that clashes among militias, sectarian violence and unresolved command structures have weakened overall security and diverted attention from counterterrorism efforts. US, SYRIAN TROOPS COME UNDER FIRE WHILE ON PATROL: REPORT Bombings in neighborhoods of Damascus, including Mezzeh, and unrest in minority areas have further illustrated the gaps ISIS and other extremist groups can exploit, according to regional security assessments and open-source reporting. \"Syria\u2019s chaos is the accelerant,\" Roggio said. \"ISIS thrives where no one is fully in charge.\" U.S. officials and analysts stress that ISIS activity in Syria is part of a wider pattern rather than an isolated flare-up. Sources in the Israeli Mossad told Fox News Digital of continued ISIS-linked activity across multiple theaters, including recruitment networks and small-scale attacks designed to test security responses and maintain operational relevance. In Turkey, security forces recently clashed with Islamic State militants during counterterrorism operations, wounding several officers, according to Reuters on Monday. Turkish authorities said the raids targeted ISIS cells suspected of planning attacks inside the country. DEADLY STRIKE ON US TROOPS TESTS TRUMP\u2019S COUNTER-ISIS PLAN \u2014 AND HIS TRUST IN SYRIA\u2019S NEW LEADER \"These are signals, not spikes,\" Roggio said. \"ISIS operates across regions, adapting to pressure and exploiting weak governance wherever it finds it.\" The renewed U.S. military action raises difficult questions for policymakers about how long the current containment strategy can hold. While U.S. officials say the Dec. 19 strikes delivered a significant blow to ISIS infrastructure, they have also acknowledged that counterterrorism operations alone cannot eliminate the underlying conditions that allow the group to persist.

OFAC designated PDVSA in January 2019 under Executive Order 13850, and President Trump later took additional steps to block PDVSA in August 2019 under Executive Order 13884, Treasury said. Treasury said Wednesday\u2019s move also complements actions announced Dec. 11 and Dec. 19 targeting PDVSA-linked officials, associates and vessels.

TRUMP ADMIN FIGHTS IN COURT TO KEEP WHITE HOUSE EAST WING DEMOLITION, $300M BALLROOM BUILD ON TRACK The exact location of the new landmark has not yet been confirmed, though the report notes it may be situated near the Lincoln Monument. Details about the amount of time it will take to build, the cost of construction, the funding amount and who is heading the project have not yet been released by the White House. Trump signed Public Law 116-217 in December 2020 authorizing the Women\u2019s Suffrage National Monument to be built on federal land in Washington, D.C., leading to the subsequent signing of the Women\u2019s Suffrage National Monument Location Act during former President Joe Biden's final week in office. The Women\u2019s Suffrage National Monument Foundation (WSNMF) announced Dec. 4 it received final and unanimous approval from the National Capital Planning Commission for a permanent two and a half acre site on the National Mall in Constitution Gardens, according to the foundation's website. Foundation leaders noted the women's suffrage monument went through a \"multi-step, rigorous review process,\" including gaining approval from the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts. The foundation also completed a public comment period with the National Park Service as part of the public scoping process, according to its website. TRUMP TAPS NEW ARCHITECT TO RESHAPE WHITE HOUSE AS $300M BALLROOM BUILD ACCELERATES It is unclear if Trump's newest proposed monument received similar approval. The Women\u2019s Suffrage National Monument will be located at the intersection of 19th St. and Constitution Avenue NW, and the next project phase will focus on creative development and design. \"The enthusiasm behind this project has been inspiring,\" WSNMF President and CEO Anna Laymon wrote in a Dec. 4 statement announcing final approval. \"We are so grateful for the dedicated support from so many who made this possible, including President Trump; President Biden; our honorary chairs Mrs. Melania Trump, Dr. Jill Biden, Mrs. Michelle Obama, Mrs. Laura Bush, and Secretary Hillary Clinton; our bipartisan and bicameral Congressional sponsors, Senator Blackburn, Senator Baldwin, Congresswoman Lesko, Congressman Neguse and their dedicated staffs; our incredible Board of Directors; and all our partners and supporters.\" TRUMP BREAKS GROUND ON MASSIVE WHITE HOUSE BALLROOM PROJECT WITH PRIVATE FUNDING FROM 'PATRIOTS' The most recent major monument built on the National Mall was the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, which was completed in 2011. The granite memorial was inspired by a line from King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech, delivered nearby on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the \"March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom\" in 1963.

    "body": "San Francisco mayor signs ordinance creating reparations fund that could grant eligible Black residents up to $5 million each in potential payments.",
    "content": "The mayor of San Francisco signed an ordinance that creates a \"Reparations Fund\" that could one day grant each of the city's eligible Black residents up to $5 million in reparations for alleged historic discrimination and displacement.\nThe ordinance, which was passed by the Board of Supervisors earlier this month, was signed by Democrat Mayor Daniel Lurie two days before Christmas. It establishes the legal framework for the fund but does not allocate funds or guarantee payments. The fund can be financed with private donations, foundations and other non-city sources.\nAny taxpayer-funded reparations payouts would require separate legislation, an identified funding source and mayoral approval. Lurie told Fox News Digital that no taxpayer money would be paid into the potential pot, given the city's $1 billion budget deficit.\n\"I was elected to drive San Francisco\u2019s recovery, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on every day,\" Lurie said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"We are not allocating money to this fund \u2014 with a historic $1 billion budget deficit, we are going to spend our money on making the city safer and cleaner.\"\nBOSTON SUBURB TRIPLES CASH PAYMENTS IN EXPANDED GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM\n\"The Reparations Plan outlines a variety of methods to provide restitution, compensation and rehabilitation to individuals who are Black and/or descendants of a chattel enslaved person and have experienced a proven harm in San Francisco,\" the ordinance reads, in part.\nThe ordinance specifically cites a 2023 policy report and recommendation document produced by the San Francisco African American Reparations Advisory Committee (AARAC), a city-appointed advisory committee.\nThe report, which is nonbinding, studied harms to Black residents and proposed remedies, including a recommendation of a $5 million payment. Around 46,000 Black residents live in San Francisco, according to U.S. Census data.\nIt argued that Black San Franciscans are victims of decades of city-driven \"residential displacement\" and \"racial discrimination,\" particularly during the urban renewal era \u2014 the period from the mid-1940s through the 1970s.\n\"The City and County of San Francisco and its agencies should issue a formal apology for past harms and commit to making substantial ongoing, systemic and programmatic investments in Black communities to address historical harms,\" the report states in its executive summary.\nIt proposed that the city \"[p]rovide a one-time, lump sum payment of $5 million to each eligible person.\"\nThe report also recommended a guaranteed annual income tied to area median income and the creation of new city agencies, including an Office of Reparations, to administer programs. It also called for major housing interventions, such as rental assistance, homeownership support and city-backed funds to purchase property along Black business corridors, as well as multi-million-dollar investments in Black-owned businesses.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe California Legislature has attempted to pass specific reparations bills but has so far failed to do so. Several proposals stalled or were rejected after the state\u2019s Reparations Task Force, which was set up in 2020 to study and recommend reparations proposals.",

    "content_clean": "The mayor of San Francisco signed an ordinance that creates a \"Reparations Fund\" that could one day grant each of the city's eligible Black residents up to $5 million in reparations for alleged historic discrimination and displacement. The ordinance, which was passed by the Board of Supervisors earlier this month, was signed by Democrat Mayor Daniel Lurie two days before Christmas. It establishes the legal framework for the fund but does not allocate funds or guarantee payments. The fund can be financed with private donations, foundations and other non-city sources. Any taxpayer-funded reparations payouts would require separate legislation, an identified funding source and mayoral approval. Lurie told Fox News Digital that no taxpayer money would be paid into the potential pot, given the city's $1 billion budget deficit. \"I was elected to drive San Francisco\u2019s recovery, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on every day,\" Lurie said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"We are not allocating money to this fund \u2014 with a historic $1 billion budget deficit, we are going to spend our money on making the city safer and cleaner.\" BOSTON SUBURB TRIPLES CASH PAYMENTS IN EXPANDED GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM \"The Reparations Plan outlines a variety of methods to provide restitution, compensation and rehabilitation to individuals who are Black and/or descendants of a chattel enslaved person and have experienced a proven harm in San Francisco,\" the ordinance reads, in part. The ordinance specifically cites a 2023 policy report and recommendation document produced by the San Francisco African American Reparations Advisory Committee (AARAC), a city-appointed advisory committee. The report, which is nonbinding, studied harms to Black residents and proposed remedies, including a recommendation of a $5 million payment. Around 46,000 Black residents live in San Francisco, according to U.S. Census data. It argued that Black San Franciscans are victims of decades of city-driven \"residential displacement\" and \"racial discrimination,\" particularly during the urban renewal era \u2014 the period from the mid-1940s through the 1970s. \"The City and County of San Francisco and its agencies should issue a formal apology for past harms and commit to making substantial ongoing, systemic and programmatic investments in Black communities to address historical harms,\" the report states in its executive summary. It proposed that the city \"[p]rovide a one-time, lump sum payment of $5 million to each eligible person.\" The report also recommended a guaranteed annual income tied to area median income and the creation of new city agencies, including an Office of Reparations, to administer programs. It also called for major housing interventions, such as rental assistance, homeownership support and city-backed funds to purchase property along Black business corridors, as well as multi-million-dollar investments in Black-owned businesses. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The California Legislature has attempted to pass specific reparations bills but has so far failed to do so. Several proposals stalled or were rejected after the state\u2019s Reparations Task Force, which was set up in 2020 to study and recommend reparations proposals.",

Riders must apply for the new, free photo ID card online, by mail, or in person, providing proof of age or disability along with a recent photo, according to Shore News Network. By contrast, on election day, voters must include their state driver\u2019s license number on their registration form. Failing to include that number on a registration form would then require identification be presented onsite for first-time voters; which could include a license or a utility bill, bank statement, paycheck or government document \u2013 not all of which have a photographic component. \"This is how ridiculous Democrat-run states are,\" one X user said. \"Beginning January 1st, a photo ID will be required for the Reduced Fare Program, but it is still not required to vote. This is how they keep states blue by cheating.\" The volunteer good-governance organization New Jersey Project also slammed state policies: \"Photo ID needed for NJ Transit discounts but not for voting. Starting January,\" the group said. \"Priorities, Trenton?\" The blog New Jersey News wrote that state officials often claim voter ID \"disenfranchises minorities\" who cannot get such identification. \"Guess they won't be riding the train either,\" the outlet said. MINNESOTA'S NEW MEDICAID FRAUD PREVENTION FIX WON'T MAKE 'ANY DIFFERENCE,' FORMER FBI AGENT SAYS The group \"Wake Up NJ\" also fired back at the new policy, citing the same disparity between arguments against voter-ID and the state\u2019s actions toward reduced-fare straphangers. \"New Jersey expects you to get that reduced fare for New Jersey Transit, but it's OK [if you don't] for voting,\" they said. The photo ID rule in-practice will allow a rider who goes a short distance on a state bus \u2013 considered a \"Zone 1\" fare \u2013 to pay 85 cents instead of the full $1.85. Commuters going to \"Zone 3\" \u2013 immediate suburbs of New York City \u2013 pay $5.30, but would be able to pay $2.40 under the reduced-fare ID policy. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Longer trips see larger savings as NJ Transit\u2019s special limited-stop service on the Garden State Parkway from New York to Toms River and Atlantic City currently costs $46.15 to hit the casinos. Showing a reduced-fare ID card would allow the rider to pay $20.65. Fox News Digital reached out to the New Jersey Secretary of State\u2019s office, which oversees elections, for comment.",

    "content": "President Donald Trump spent much of 2025 attempting what had eluded his predecessors: personally engaging both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an effort to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. From high-profile summits to direct phone calls, the administration pushed for a negotiated settlement even as the fighting ground on and the map changed little.\nBy year\u2019s end, the outlines of a potential deal were clearer than they had been at any point since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, with U.S. and Ukrainian officials coalescing around a revised 20-point framework addressing ceasefire terms, security guarantees and disputed territory. But 2025 also made clear why the war has proven so resistant to resolution: neither battlefield pressure, economic sanctions nor intensified diplomacy were enough to force Moscow or Kyiv into concessions they were unwilling to make.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s push for a deal\nThe year began with a high-profile fallout last February between President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, when the Ukrainian leader stormed out of the White House after Trump told him he did not have \"any cards\" to bring to negotiations with Russia.\nFrustrated by the pace of talks after promising to end the war on \"Day One\" of his presidency, Trump initially directed his ire toward Zelenskyy before later conceding that Moscow, not Kyiv, was standing in the way of progress.\n\"I thought the Russia-Ukraine war was the easiest to stop but Putin has let me down,\" Trump said in September 2025.\nThat frustration had already surfaced publicly months earlier as Russian strikes continued despite diplomatic engagement. \"He talks nice, and then he bombs everybody in the evening,\" Trump said in July.\nTrump\u2019s outreach to Russian President Vladimir Putin culminated in a high-profile summit in Alaska in August, though additional meetings were later called off amid a lack of progress toward a deal.\nZELENSKYY ENCOURAGED BY 'VERY GOOD' CHRISTMAS TALKS WITH US\nStill, Trump struck a more optimistic tone toward the end of the year. On Sunday, after meeting Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago, the president said the sides were \"getting a lot closer, maybe very close\" to a peace agreement, while acknowledging that major obstacles remained \u2014 including the status of disputed territory such as the Donbas region, which he described as \"very tough.\"\nTrump said the meeting followed what he described as a \"very positive\" phone call with Putin that lasted more than two hours, underscoring the administration\u2019s continued effort to press both sides toward a negotiated end to the war.\nWhere negotiations stand now\nBy the end of 2025, the diplomatic track had narrowed around a more defined \u2014 but still contested \u2014 framework. U.S. officials and Ukrainian negotiators have been working from a revised 20-point proposal that outlines a potential ceasefire, security guarantees for Ukraine, and mechanisms to address disputed territory and demilitarized zones.\nZelenskyy has publicly signaled openness to elements of the framework while insisting that any agreement must include robust, long-term security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. Ukrainian officials have also made clear that questions surrounding occupied territory, including parts of the Donbas, cannot be resolved solely through ceasefire lines without broader guarantees.\nRussia, however, has not agreed to the proposal. Moscow has continued to insist on recognition of its territorial claims and has resisted terms that would constrain its military posture or require meaningful concessions. Russian officials have at times linked their negotiating stance to developments on the battlefield, reinforcing the Kremlin\u2019s view that leverage \u2014 not urgency \u2014 should dictate the pace of talks.\nThe result is a negotiation process that is more structured than earlier efforts, but still far from resolution: positions have hardened even as channels remain open, and talks continue alongside ongoing fighting rather than replacing it.\nRussia\u2019s territorial pressure \u2014 and Ukraine\u2019s limited gains\nEven as diplomacy intensified in 2025, the war on the ground remained defined by slow, grinding territorial pressure rather than decisive breakthroughs. Russian forces continued pushing for incremental gains in eastern and southern Ukraine, particularly along axes tied to Moscow\u2019s long-stated objective of consolidating control over territory it claims as Russian.\nRussian advances were measured and costly, often unfolding village by village through artillery-heavy assaults and sustained drone use rather than sweeping offensives. While Moscow failed to capture major new cities or trigger a collapse in Ukrainian defenses, it expanded control in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine, maintaining pressure across multiple fronts and keeping territorial questions central to both the fighting and any future negotiations.\nUkraine, for its part, did not mount a large-scale counteroffensive in 2025 comparable to earlier phases of the war. Ukrainian forces achieved localized tactical successes, at times reclaiming small areas or reversing specific Russian advances, but these gains were limited in scope and often temporary. None translated into a sustained territorial breakthrough capable of altering the broader balance of the front.\nInstead, Kyiv focused on preventing further losses, reinforcing defensive lines and imposing costs on Russian forces through precision strikes and asymmetric tactics. With decisive territorial gains out of reach, Ukraine expanded attacks against Russian energy infrastructure, targeting refineries, fuel depots and other hubs critical to sustaining Moscow\u2019s war effort \u2014 including sites deep inside Russian territory.\nZELENSKYY SAYS FRESH RUSSIAN ATTACK ON UKRAINE SHOWS PUTIN'S 'TRUE ATTITUDE' AHEAD OF TRUMP MEETING\nRussia, meanwhile, continued its own campaign against Ukraine\u2019s energy grid, striking power and heating infrastructure as part of a broader effort to strain Ukraine\u2019s economy, civilian resilience and air defenses. The result was a widening pattern of horizontal escalation, as both sides sought leverage beyond the front lines without achieving a decisive military outcome.\nThe result was a battlefield stalemate with movement at the margins: Russia advanced just enough to sustain its territorial claims and domestic narrative, while Ukraine proved capable of blunting assaults and imposing costs but not of reclaiming large swaths of occupied land. The fighting underscored a central reality of 2025 \u2014 territory still mattered deeply to both sides, but neither possessed the military leverage needed to force a decisive shift.\nThat dynamic would increasingly shape the limits of diplomacy. Without a major change on the battlefield, talks could test red lines and clarify positions, but not compel compromise.\nWhy talks stalled: leverage without decision\nFor all the diplomatic activity in 2025, negotiations repeatedly ran into the same obstacle: neither Russia nor Ukraine faced the kind of pressure that would force a decisive compromise.\nOn the battlefield, Russia continued to absorb losses while pressing for incremental territorial gains, reinforcing Moscow\u2019s belief that time remained on its side.

Despite years of Western sanctions, Russia continued financing its war effort in 2025, ramping up defense production and adapting its economy to sustain prolonged conflict.

    "content": "We could not let 2025 end without one last reminder about digital safety. Cybercriminals never slow down. In fact, the holidays and the start of a new year often bring a surge in scams, account takeovers and data theft. The good news is that cybersecurity need not feel overwhelming. You do not need advanced skills or expensive tools. With a few smart habits, you can lower your risk and protect your digital life throughout 2026. To help you start the year strong, here are 10 simple cybersecurity resolutions that actually work.\nSign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\nGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.\nAMERICA'S MOST-USED PASSWORD IN 2025 REVEALED\n1) Start the year with strong passwords\nPasswords remain your first line of defense. Weak or reused passwords make it easy for attackers to break into multiple accounts at once. Use a unique password for every account. Longer passphrases work better than short, complex strings. A reputable password manager can generate and securely store passwords, so you do not have to memorize them. One rule matters most. Never reuse passwords.\nNext, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.\nCheck out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.\n2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second step after your password. This usually includes a code from an app or a physical security key. Even if someone steals your password, 2FA can block access. App-based authenticators provide stronger protection than text messages. Turn it on for email, banking, social media and shopping accounts first.\n3) Audit your digital presence\nOld accounts create new risks. Take time to review shopping sites, forums, apps and subscriptions you no longer use. Delete what you do not need. Update privacy settings on what you keep. Share less personal information whenever possible, especially birthdays, locations and phone numbers. A smaller digital footprint limits abuse.\n5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE\n4) Keep software and devices up to date\nSecurity updates fix real vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploit. Skipping updates leaves doors open. Enable automatic updates for operating systems, browsers, apps, routers and smart devices. This habit blocks many common attacks without extra effort. Outdated software remains one of the top causes of successful hacks.\n5) Use a personal data removal service\nYour personal information appears on hundreds of data broker sites. These sites collect names, addresses, phone numbers and relatives, then sell access to anyone willing to pay. A personal data removal service helps locate and remove that information. This step reduces scam attempts, phishing messages and identity fraud risks throughout the year. Less exposed data means fewer threats.\nWhile no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\nCheck out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting Cyberguy.com.\nGet a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com\n6) Consider identity theft protection\nIdentity theft often starts quietly. A breach happens. Data leaks. Fraud follows months later. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Many services can also scan for accounts tied to multiple email addresses, making cleanup easier. Early alerts help you act before damage spreads.\nSee my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.\nPROTECT YOURSELF FROM SNEAKY WEB INJECTION SCAMS\n7) Think before you click and use strong antivirus protection\nMost cyberattacks still begin with a click. Fake shipping notices, refund alerts and urgent messages push people to act fast. Pause before clicking links or opening attachments. Many scams now use AI to generate realistic messages, fake voices and convincing images, making it even more important to pause before you click. Verify messages through official websites or apps instead. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by blocking malware, ransomware and malicious downloads across your devices, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\nGet my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.\n8) Secure your home Wi-Fi network\nYour Wi-Fi network connects everything. That makes it a valuable target. Change the default router password right away. Enable WPA3 encryption if your router supports it. Keep router firmware up to date and avoid sharing your network with unknown devices. A secure network protects every connected device.\n9) Back up your data regularly\nBackups protect you from ransomware, hardware failure and accidental deletion. Many people still skip them. Use cloud backups, an external hard drive or both. Automate the process so it runs without reminders. If something goes wrong, backups let you recover quickly.\n10) Freeze your credit if you do not need it\nA credit freeze prevents new accounts from opening in your name. It remains one of the strongest defenses against identity fraud heading into 2026. Freezing credit is free and reversible. You can temporarily lift it when applying for loans or credit cards. This single step blocks many identity crimes outright.

    "content_clean": "We could not let 2025 end without one last reminder about digital safety. Cybercriminals never slow down. In fact, the holidays and the start of a new year often bring a surge in scams, account takeovers and data theft. The good news is that cybersecurity need not feel overwhelming. You do not need advanced skills or expensive tools. With a few smart habits, you can lower your risk and protect your digital life throughout 2026. To help you start the year strong, here are 10 simple cybersecurity resolutions that actually work.

AMERICA'S MOST-USED PASSWORD IN 2025 REVEALED 1) Start the year with strong passwords Passwords remain your first line of defense. Weak or reused passwords make it easy for attackers to break into multiple accounts at once. Use a unique password for every account. Longer passphrases work better than short, complex strings. A reputable password manager can generate and securely store passwords, so you do not have to memorize them. One rule matters most. Never reuse passwords. Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials. Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com. 2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second step after your password. This usually includes a code from an app or a physical security key. Even if someone steals your password, 2FA can block access. App-based authenticators provide stronger protection than text messages. Turn it on for email, banking, social media and shopping accounts first. 3) Audit your digital presence Old accounts create new risks. Take time to review shopping sites, forums, apps and subscriptions you no longer use. Delete what you do not need. Update privacy settings on what you keep. Share less personal information whenever possible, especially birthdays, locations and phone numbers. A smaller digital footprint limits abuse. 5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE 4) Keep software and devices up to date Security updates fix real vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploit. Skipping updates leaves doors open. Enable automatic updates for operating systems, browsers, apps, routers and smart devices. This habit blocks many common attacks without extra effort. Outdated software remains one of the top causes of successful hacks. 5) Use a personal data removal service Your personal information appears on hundreds of data broker sites. These sites collect names, addresses, phone numbers and relatives, then sell access to anyone willing to pay. A personal data removal service helps locate and remove that information. This step reduces scam attempts, phishing messages and identity fraud risks throughout the year. Less exposed data means fewer threats. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting Cyberguy.com. Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com 6) Consider identity theft protection Identity theft often starts quietly. A breach happens. Data leaks. Fraud follows months later. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Many services can also scan for accounts tied to multiple email addresses, making cleanup easier. Early alerts help you act before damage spreads. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com. PROTECT YOURSELF FROM SNEAKY WEB INJECTION SCAMS 7) Think before you click and use strong antivirus protection Most cyberattacks still begin with a click. Fake shipping notices, refund alerts and urgent messages push people to act fast. Pause before clicking links or opening attachments. Many scams now use AI to generate realistic messages, fake voices and convincing images, making it even more important to pause before you click. Verify messages through official websites or apps instead. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by blocking malware, ransomware and malicious downloads across your devices, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com. 8) Secure your home Wi-Fi network Your Wi-Fi network connects everything. That makes it a valuable target. Change the default router password right away. Enable WPA3 encryption if your router supports it. Keep router firmware up to date and avoid sharing your network with unknown devices. A secure network protects every connected device. 9) Back up your data regularly Backups protect you from ransomware, hardware failure and accidental deletion. Many people still skip them. Use cloud backups, an external hard drive or both. Automate the process so it runs without reminders. If something goes wrong, backups let you recover quickly. 10) Freeze your credit if you do not need it A credit freeze prevents new accounts from opening in your name. It remains one of the strongest defenses against identity fraud heading into 2026. Freezing credit is free and reversible. You can temporarily lift it when applying for loans or credit cards. This single step blocks many identity crimes outright.

    "content": "China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has vowed to reunify China and Taiwan in his annual New Year\u2019s Eve speech in Beijing.\nSpeaking the day after the conclusion of intense Chinese military drills around Taiwan, Xi said: \u201cThe reunification of our motherland, a trend of the times, is unstoppable.\u201d\nChina claims Taiwan, a self-governing island, as part of its territory and has long vowed to annex it, using force if necessary.\nUS intelligence is increasingly concerned about the advancing capabilities of China\u2019s armed forces to launch such an attack if Xi decides the time is right.\nOn Monday and Tuesday, China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army launched live-fire military drills around Taiwan, simulating a blockade of main ports and sending its navy, air force, rocket force and coastguard to encircle Taiwan\u2019s main island. The drills, called \u201cJustice Mission 2025\u201d, came closer to Taiwan than previous exercises, and involved at least 200 warplanes across the two days, the highest tally for more than a year. Taiwan said 27 missiles were also fired towards Taiwan, with several landing within 27 nautical miles of its coastline.\nOn Wednesday the drills had ended but Taiwan remained on high alert, with 25 Chinese Navy and Coast Guard ships still around Taiwan, and two surveillance balloons were dispatched with one flying across Taiwan\u2019s northern coast line.\nThe drills were expected by analysts before the year\u2019s end but were also connected by Chinese commentators to a recent arms approval by the US government for a record $11bn (\u00a38bn) weapons sales to Taiwan.\nSpeaking in Beijing on Wednesday evening, Xi said China \u201cembraced the world with open arms\u201d and highlighted several multilateral conferences hosted by Beijing this year, including the Shanghai Cooperation Summit in August, when world leaders including Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, India\u2019s Narendra Modi and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, gathered in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing.\nThe broadcast of Xi\u2019s speech on Chinese state media was interspersed with several shots of China\u2019s largest ever military parade, which was held in September to mark 80 years since the end of the second world war. During the parade, which was viewed as an unbridled display of military force, Xi, Putin and North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, stood side by side in Beijing \u2013 a geopolitical alignment that has been called the \u201caxis of upheaval\u201d.\nCentral to Xi\u2019s vision of a new world order is the annexation of Taiwan and the support of other countries in recognising Taiwan as part of \u201cOne China\u201d ruled by the Chinese Communist party in Beijing, something that the majority of Taiwanese people reject.\nHowever several governments criticised China\u2019s drills this week, including the UK, Japan, Australia, the Philippines, the EU and the US. China\u2019s foreign ministry said it had lodged \u201cserious protests\u201d over their remarks, erroneously claiming that those nations\u2019 domestic policies recognised Taiwan as part of China.\n\u201cThe biggest threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 forces\u2019 separatist activities and external connivance and support for these activities,\u201d the ministry\u2019s spokesman Lin Jian said on Wednesday.\nIn his speech, Xi also highlighted \u201cTaiwan Retrocession Day\u201d, a memorial day created in 2025 to mark the anniversary of the end of Japanese imperial rule in Taiwan in 1945. This year, Taiwan also passed a law to recognise the date, 25 October, as a national holiday. The legacy of the second world war has been a big theme in political rhetoric in China and Taiwan this year. China has emphasised its role in defeating the Japanese in that conflict, something that China feels has been underappreciated in the west. Taiwan\u2019s president, Lai Ching-te, gave a punchy speech this year comparing Taiwan to European democracies in the 1930s that faced a threat from Nazi Germany.\nIn his own New Year\u2019s Day address on Thursday morning, Lai again warned of China\u2019s \u201crising expansionary ambitions\u201d and vowed to \u201cstaunchly defend national sovereignty\u201d.\nHe also urged opposition parties in Taiwan \u2013 which control the parliament \u2013 to stop blocking a special bill which would increase Taiwan\u2019s defence budget.\n\u201cFacing China\u2019s alarming military ambitions, Taiwan has no time to wait and certainly no time to consume ourselves with internal strife,\u201d Lai said.\nXi\u2019s speech also praised China\u2019s progress in hi-tech development this year, mentioning kickboxing robots and Tianwen-2, a comet exploration mission that launched in May. He also flagged the global success of Chinese cultural exports, such as the video game Black Myth: Wukong and the animated film Ne Zha 2.\nEarlier in the day, Xi addressed a meeting of top Chinese Communist party officials and said that China was on track to meet its 5% GDP growth target.",

The increase in Chinese sales has alarmed EU countries, particularly Germany and France, who fear losing millions of automotive jobs if the industry shrivels.\nNorway leads the world in EV take-up, helped by generous purchase subsidies, but in Spain and the UK a large number of the Chinese cars on offer are hybrids, which combine a petrol engine with a small battery.\nTu Le, the founder of Sino Auto Insights, a consultancy, said: \u201cThe Chinese are tackling the EU region by region since there are pockets of support in some areas and pockets of opposition in others.\u201d\nNeither the UK nor Norway have imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, as the EU has done, leaving them open to battery car sales.\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a lobby group, Chinese manufacturers sold 187,800 cars in the UK out of total sales of 1.87m during the first 11 months of the year \u2013 double last year\u2019s sales.\nSchmidt said the UK was a particularly juicy target for Chinese brands because it is a large market with no British mass-market champions. Rover ceased trading in the early 2000s, Vauxhall is part of the Stellantis conglomerate, while MGs are made in China by state-owned SAIC.\n\u201cWith no genuine domestic volume brands for UK consumers to choose from, UK consumers crucially can no longer participate in what is known as patriotic purchasing,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn Germany and France, half of each country\u2019s new-car market is effectively in the control of domestic brands. While in China, we now also see two-thirds of the market is accounted for by domestic brands.\u201d\nThe manufacturers that are losing out on UK sales appeared to be Japanese. Nissan and Toyota have factories in the UK but that has not prevented them from losing nearly a percentage point of market share apiece in the past year. Honda and Suzuki sales also dropped, while Mitsubishi has pulled out completely.\nThe EU imposed tariffs of between 17% and 38% on Chinese electric cars last year, in an effort to level the playing field. However, the tariffs apply to electric cars only, leaving a large back door for Chinese manufacturers to win market share by undercutting European manufacturers on sales of hybrids as well.\nSchmidt\u2019s analysis showed that less than 40% of all Chinese-brand models entering western Europe during the third quarter of 2025 were pure battery electric. That means that the design of the EU tariffs has allowed Chinese manufacturers to continue to undercut European rivals, while also pushing them to sell more polluting models.\nThe EU watered down its targets for electric car sales recently, saying it will allow 10% of sales to continue to have internal combustion engines after 2035 \u2013 it had previously planned to ban them entirely. European carmakers had lobbied hard for the changes, arguing they need to continue selling petrol and diesel cars to earn enough profits to invest in battery car factories.\nHowever, some car executives and analysts have argued that slowing the transition in Europe will allow Chinese carmakers to race further ahead. Schmidt has forecast that Chinese manufacturers\u2019 share will peak just shy of 10% across Europe between 2028 and 2030, while China\u2019s share of the battery car market will peak at 13%.",

Police said officers responded to reports the woman was struggling in the water at about 2.55pm on New Year\u2019s Day. They arrived to find the woman pulled on to land, but she died at the scene. Swimmer missing at Coogee Meanwhile, a search was under way on Thursday morning for another swimmer believed to be missing in the water at Coogee. Just after 6am on Thursday emergency services were called to Coogee beach after reports a man \u2013 believed to be aged in his 20s \u2013 was in trouble in the water. Coogee Surf Life Saving Club president Ben Heenan said four people had decided to go for a morning swim at the beach. \u201cDue to large surf, they were swept out in a very big rip, swept off their feet,\u201d Heenan said. \u201cThey tried to make their way back to shore and required assistance. An off-duty police officer and two off-duty surf life-savers went in and provided that assistance. \u201cThree of them were able to make it back to shore. Unfortunately, one was unable to return. We immediately commenced a search.\u201d Police, ambulance, surf life saving and council officers have joined the search. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a hazardous surf warning for much of the NSW coast, stretching from Byron to the Illawarra. Surf and swell conditions were expected to be hazardous on Thursday for coastal activities such as rock fishing, boating, and swimming, the BoM said. The police marine area command said people should consider staying out of the water and avoid walking near surf-exposed areas. Search for teenage boy after boat capsized The incidents follow the death of a man in Sydney on New Year\u2019s Eve, after a dinghy capsized at Palm beach. Two men and a 14-year-old boy were in the vessel when it overturned in rough conditions around Barrenjoey headland about 11.35am. A man was pulled from the water by surf life-savers and treated by paramedics, but he died at the scene. A second man was able to climb on to nearby rocks before he was winched to safety by a rescue helicopter and taken to hospital. A search for the missing boy was expected to continue on New Year\u2019s Day. Steven Pearce, the chief executive of Surf Life Saving NSW, said the past 24 hours had been \u201ca very horrific period in terms of drownings\u201d for NSW. \u201cThat\u2019s on top of multiple mass rescues that were conducted yesterday by life-savers and lifeguards right up the NSW coast,\u201d Pearce told 2GB radio on Thursday morning.",

Finnish coastguard officers boarded the ship at 11am, about six hours after disruption to the cables was first reported. Fourteen crew members, including several Russians, were taken into custody.\nA helicopter sent to investigate reported that the ship was dragging its anchor along the bottom of the seabed. \u201cAt this stage, it is still too early to assess whether this was an intentional act or an accident,\u201d Helsinki\u2019s deputy police chief Heikki Kopperoinen told the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat.\nSince Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, some experts and political leaders have viewed the suspected sabotage of cables in the Baltic Sea as part of a hybrid war carried out by Russia against western countries.\nDetectives said they would interrogate the crew, which includes sailors from Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. The vessel, sailing under a flag of convenience from St Vincent and the Grenadines, has been taken to a port near Helsinki.\nEU countries accuse Russia of using dilapidated vessels belonging to a \u201cshadow fleet\u201d to smuggle oil around the world in defiance of western sanctions. The fleet has been linked with previous cases of cable-cutting and with the mysterious appearance of drones in Denmark and Germany.\nIn January, Nato stepped up its naval presence in the area under an operation called Baltic Sentry. It came after Finnish commandos seized another ship, the Eagle S, on Christmas Day 2024 when it damaged critical infrastructure. A court in Helsinki later acquitted its crew on the grounds the incident took place outside Finnish territorial waters.\n\u201cFinland is prepared for security challenges of various kinds, and we respond to them as necessary,\u201d the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, said on X on Wednesday.\nFinland\u2019s deputy prosecutor general, Jukka Rappe, said there were \u201cstrong indications of a crime\u201d involving the Fitburg but that it was too soon to reach a conclusion. There was sufficient evidence to open a preliminary investigation, he added.\nThe vessel was in Finland\u2019s exclusive economic zone when it was located by a border guard patrol boat and helicopter. Its anchor chain was found to be lowered into the sea, police said. Finnish police said they were investigating \u201caggravated criminal damage, attempted aggravated criminal damage, and aggravated interference with telecommunications\u201d.\nThe damaged cables were in the Gulf of Finland between Finland and Estonia. One belonged to the Finnish telecommunications operator Elisa and the other, according to Estonia, was owned by the Swedish provider Arelion. Services were routed via other cables.\nWednesday\u2019s incident came as Russia launched a large-scale drone attack on the Ukrainian port city of Odesa. Six people were injured, including children, with four blocks of flats hit. Two energy facilities sustained significant damage, the power company DTEK said.\nRussia has been systematically targeting Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure, leaving civilians without heat and light in freezing winter conditions. More than 170,000 people had no electricity after the Odesa attack, Ukraine\u2019s energy ministry said. The Kyiv region is also experiencing severe blackouts.\nMeanwhile, the defence ministry in Moscow released video footage that it said was of a crashed drone that was on its way on Sunday to Vladimir Putin\u2019s presidential palace in the Novgorod region. Russia claims Ukraine carried out a major attack with 91 drones.\nThe story has been widely debunked. On Wednesday Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry dismissed the video three days after the event as \u201claughable\u201d, Reuters reported, and said Kyiv was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d the attack did not happen.

But you no longer need to be a multimillionaire to own a Picasso \u2013 for \u20ac100, anyone in the world has the chance to walk away with a painting by one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.\nThe French charity Alzheimer\u2019s Research Foundation announced recently it was raffling Picasso\u2019s 1941 portrait, T\u00eate de femme, which is worth more than \u20ac1m, to a single winner. Proceeds from the tickets will help fund Alzheimer\u2019s research, one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide.\nThe project, entitled \u201c1 Picasso for 100 Euros\u201d, is the first of its kind in the world, and a natural continuation of Picasso\u2019s legacy, according to his grandson Olivier Picasso.\n\u201cMy grandfather was very generous, but he was also discreet,\u201d Olivier told the Guardian. \u201cHe helped his family, especially my grandmother Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se [Walter]. He helped friends. He helped people in need during the civil war in Spain, during the second world war, and even after, in the 50s and 60s.\n\u201cSo for me, this project is an absolutely logical and legitimate part of his legacy. I hope in the future to be able to do this every year if possible.\u201d\nThe raffle is the brainchild of P\u00e9ri Cochin, a French television producer and owner of the tableware company Waww La Table. Cochin came up with the idea after seeing her mother use them at fundraising events she hosted.\n\u201cI thought, wouldn\u2019t it be great to do a worldwide raffle, by selling tickets online? I decided it should be a piece of art, and what is the most famous name in art? Obviously, it\u2019s Picasso,\u201d she said.\nCochin contacted Olivier Picasso, a childhood friend of hers. When he and the rest of the Picasso administration and the Picasso estate gave their approval, she reserved the 1941 painting from the Opera gallery, which will receive just under \u20ac1m after the draw.\n\u201cWe are used to hearing about Picasso and these high-priced auctions, but this was the first time where Picasso was really related to a charity,\u201d she said.\nOlivier said the family \u201chad an instant connection with the project\u201d, not least because the money raised is going to a good cause. There is no cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and no treatment that can stop or reverse its progression. \u201cNow that we are living older than before, we or people around us could be affected by this disease. And I know how difficult and painful it is,\u201d he added.\nThe goal is to sell 120,00 tickets, raising \u20ac11m for Alzheimer\u2019s research. The draw is scheduled to take place at Christie\u2019s auction house in Paris on 14 April. If not enough tickets are sold to cover the cost of the painting, all participants will be reimbursed.\nOlivier said T\u00eate de femme was a \u201cvery interesting\u201d work that was painted in the same studio in the Left Bank in Paris as Picasso\u2019s 1937 masterpiece Guernica. \u201cThe period was important for my grandfather, because he was at the end of a process to divorce his first wife, Olga Khokhlova \u2013 a divorce that never happened because Franco abolished the divorce law [in 1939], despite meeting my grandmother and Dora Maar.\n\u201cThe period was also very complicated because of the occupation of Paris by the Nazis. And so the colours are darker than usual, with brown, black, and grey. While it\u2019s a beautiful depiction of a woman, there is still the ambience of Picasso. My grandfather kept the painting as a souvenir of the moment.\u201d\nCochin has organised two previous raffles for Picasso paintings, in 2013 and 2020, raising a total of more than \u20ac10m. The first winner was 25-year-old Jeffrey Gonano, who became the owner of a Picasso drawing valued at \u20ac860,000. \u201cHe put the painting in the Museum of Pittsburg for a while, and now it\u2019s in storage at Christie\u2019s in New York, because he didn\u2019t want to keep it at home,\u201d she said.\nThe second winner was Claudia Borgogno, an accountant from Ventimiglia, Italy, whose son had given her a raffle ticket for Christmas. She became the owner of a 1921 Picasso valued at \u20ac1m.\n\u201cShe still has the painting, she said it would change her life. It\u2019s a really beautiful story,\u201d Cochin added.",

    "content": "When Ireland redeveloped a swathe of central Dublin in the 1990s, the idea was to create a version of Paris\u2019s Left Bank, a cultural quarter of cobbled lanes, art and urban renewal.\nPlanners and architects transformed the run-down Temple Bar site by the River Liffey into an ambitious experiment that drew throngs of visitors and won awards.\nThree decades later, there are some withering verdicts on what happened next.\n\u201cIt seems that Temple Bar is becoming a violent post-apocalyptic place,\u201d a judge said last year after sentencing a man who bludgeoned a victim with a can of cider. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to see it, that people can\u2019t be safe down there. It makes it a no-go area for people.\u201d\nFrank McDonald, who writes about urban planning for the Irish Times, recalled how he moved into the area in 1995, full of optimism, but fled in 2022 amid hordes of pub-crawlers and thumping nightclub music. \u201cI feared that our home would become uninhabitable,\u201d he wrote in July.\nSince then, there have been more grim headlines, including the alleged mugging of a visiting NFL quarterback and an assault on an English tourist who later died. A study of online reviews rated Temple Bar the world\u2019s third biggest tourist trap, reinforcing the perception of a raucous, brawling district best left to stag parties.\nIt adds up to a crushing indictment of the original vision: instead of art and culture, crime and overpriced Guinness.\nThere is, however, an alternative view that Temple Bar is a victim of outdated stereotyping and that a renaissance is under way, making the area a vibrant and a worthy home for organisations such as the Irish Film Institute, Project Arts Centre, Smock Alley Theatre and Graphic Studio Gallery.\n\u201cIt is Dublin\u2019s cultural quarter,\u201d said Martin Harte, the chief executive officer of the Temple Bar Company, a business association. \u201cThe era of massive drinking \u2013 it\u2019s not that now. Temple Bar is an entirely different place. It\u2019s the front room of Dublin city.\u201d\nViolent incidents garnered publicity but set against an annualised footfall of 24m visits they were very rare, said Harte. \u201cTo say Temple Bar is unsafe is not accurate. Walk around, it has everything from small art galleries to coffee shops, tattoo parlours, vintage clothes shops, hotels. It\u2019s where people come, it gives it that electricity.\u201d\nTom Roo, 39, and Heather Mitchell, 28, a couple from Leeds, agreed. \u201cI was expecting young lads and drinking everywhere but it\u2019s really nice to walk around, it\u2019s relaxed,\u201d said Roo. Mitchell found the pubs picturesque \u2013 more so even than their images on Instagram.\nIn the 1980s, much of this web of lanes and streets was derelict and due to become a bus terminus. Instead, in 1991 the government decided to channel Dublin\u2019s year as European city of culture into a showcase project driven by a state agency and tax incentives. Renovated historic buildings and new contemporary structures and art installations created a landmark in urban renewal.\nThe decade also brought cheap flights, laddish culture and superpubs that turned Temple Bar into a boozing destination. \u201cThat\u2019s where it got its initial stripes, its brand,\u201d said Harte. \u201cYou had to queue behind 30, 40 people to get in anywhere to have a drink.\u201d\nThe supposed culture hub was nicknamed the Temple of Bars and likened to Ibiza. Bacchanalia continued through the 2008 economic crash and prompted another judge \u2013 ruling in a 2017 assault case \u2013 to brand Temple Bar a vomit-splattered \u201cdisgrace to Ireland\u201d.\nThe Covid pandemic brought more challenges. Gangs marauded through under-policed streets, stealing and vandalising. \u201cAll the zombies came out,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Luis Gonz\u00e1lez, director of PhotoIreland, which runs exhibitions and a bookshop called The Library Project.\nHowever, improved policing has restored safety, confidence and an eclectic vibe, said Gonz\u00e1lez, echoing a widespread view among stakeholders. People who come to take selfies outside famous pubs end up visiting galleries and discovering artists.\nJohn Cullen, who runs a jewellery shop and stall in a refurbished square, said the outdoor market drew in families with children. \u201cIt civilises the place.\u201d\nPubs such as the Palace, Gogarty\u2019s and the Norseman still drew big crowds but the number of late night licences \u2013 which allow venues to serve alcohol until 3am \u2013 had plunged from 25 to seven and fine dining was making inroads, said Harte. \u201cEvery single pub now serves food. People are still drinking but nowhere near at the old levels.\u201d\nWill Wollen, who moved to Temple Bar two years ago to run the Gaiety School of Acting, said the area\u2019s reputation for excess was unfair. \u201cThere is an energy but it\u2019s not a hen party hellscape. It\u2019s a pub culture with warmth and friendliness.\u201d\nStephen Kennedy, who runs the Copper and Straw cafe and chairs the Aston Quay and Temple Bar Business and Residents\u2019 Alliance, said there were plans for more street art, seating, lighting and perhaps an outdoor cinema. \u201cI would tell any tourist coming to Dublin that Temple Bar is a must.\u201d\nOther Dubliners, in contrast, urge visitors to steer clear unless they like crowds, price gouging and ersatz Irishness. Critics also accuse platforms such as Airbnb of driving up rents and driving out people.\nPerry Share, a sociologist and co-editor of a book on Irish pubs, said Temple Bar was a \u201cpub theme park\u201d that offered a degree of authenticity. \u201cTourists come to replicate an Irish pub experience they have perhaps seen online. The music and drink is essential to that.\u201d\nA vox pop of early evening drinkers last week yielded toasts to Temple Bar. \u201cTikTok said it was too touristy but the buzz is great,\u201d said Tom Salter, 22, from London.

    "content": "Israel is running a parallel system of controls for shipments into Gaza, allowing commercial traders to bring goods into the territory that are barred for humanitarian organisations.\nBasic life-saving supplies including generators and tent poles are on a long Israeli blacklist of \u201cdual-use\u201d items. The Israeli government says entry of these items must be severely restricted because they could be exploited by Hamas or other armed groups for military ends.\nHowever, for at least a month, Israeli authorities have allowed businesses to transport multiple dual-use items into Gaza, including generators and metal pallets, which are more durable in winter rains and mud than wooden alternatives.\nThese are now on sale in the open market in Gaza, according to military, diplomatic and humanitarian sources. They must pass through the same three tightly controlled Israeli checkpoints that currently bar shipments of these goods for aid organisations.\n\u201cIt seems highly improbable that the Israelis don\u2019t know about them,\u201d said one diplomatic source. \u201cIt\u2019s very shocking that these things are able to enter through commercial channels.\u201d\nThe disparity limits the work of humanitarian organisations supporting Palestinians at a time of desperate need, while providing lucrative opportunities to commercial traders who can secure import permits from Israeli authorities.\nThe American commander of a new US base in southern Israel has been briefed on such dual-use restrictions. Lt Gen Patrick Frank has discussed the controls with diplomats and humanitarians at the Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC), which was established in October to monitor the Donald Trump-brokered ceasefire and plan for Gaza\u2019s future. His views on the matter are not known.\nIsrael has a long track record of exploiting access to Gaza to further its political goals, said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli human rights group that has been monitoring controls for 20 years.\n\u201cOn the surface the private sector [shipments of items on the dual-use list] can appear to be very confusing and an inconsistency,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I see it as very consistent with their policy of trying to strengthen the hand of certain actors and weaken the hand of others.\u201d\nEntry controls on items such as generators did not reflect \u201cthe inherent risk or danger of the item itself\u201d, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of: whose hands is it in? Where is it? How is it being used?\u201d\nIsraeli restrictions have long made trade into Gaza particularly lucrative for those Palestinians and Israelis who can secure permits. Items on the dual-use list now sell for huge premiums inside Gaza.\n\u201cThe only way to get a generator right now is on the private sector,\u201d said Sam Rose, acting director for Gaza for Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. \u201cThere\u2019s a mark up on that.\u201d\n\u201cMy understanding is that it is the business interests on all sides \u2013 Israeli, Egyptian, Palestinian \u2013 with some of the security companies that enjoy Israeli protection also taking a cut alongside other criminal elements, all in all supporting the growth of an illegal economy,\u201d Rose added. \u201cWhat\u2019s not clear to me is whether Hamas is getting a cut. I would assume so but have not seen any confirmation of this.\u201d\nAhmed Alkhatib, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that when it came to commercial deliveries into Gaza, \u201cYou\u2019re not just paying fees and taxes to Hamas in Gaza, you\u2019re paying fees and taxes to merchants on the Israeli side. We all know that Gaza was and will always be a massive market for the Israeli economy.\u201d\nCogat, the Israeli defence ministry unit that controls access to Gaza, denied \u201cpreventing or delaying\u201d aid shipments into Gaza or applying looser restrictions for commercial traders.\n\u201cThe policy governing the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip is approved by the political echelon in Israel and implemented by Cogat in a uniform manner vis-a-vis the UN, international organisations, donor countries, and the private sector,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement.\nFor dual-use items, Israel \u201coffers international organisations alternatives that allow and facilitate a humanitarian response\u201d, the statement said, without providing any details. Spokesperson Shimi Zuaretz also said medical aid organisations had been given permits to bring generators into Gaza \u201cover the last month\u201d.\nThe Israeli military referred questions about aid shipments into Gaza to Cogat. The US military declined to comment.\nThe shipment controls are the latest instance of Israel weaponising aid for political and military goals in Gaza. Over the summer Israel caused a famine in parts of the territory by blocking food shipments for weeks, then allowing only a trickle of aid to enter, killing hundreds of people.\nIsrael this week told 37 NGOs active in Gaza they would have to cease all operations within 60 days, unless they hand over detailed information on their Palestinian staff.\nDiplomats and humanitarian officials have said that stopping the work of the NGOs listed would have catastrophic consequences and put Palestinian lives at risk.\n\u201cThe EU has been clear: the NGO registration law cannot be implemented in its current form,\u201d the EU humanitarian chief, Hadja Lahbib, posted on social media. \u201cIHL [international humanitarian law] leaves no room for doubt: aid must reach those in need.\u201d\n\u201cThe reality is that the commercial sector can bring in what it wants [now],\u201d said Rose. \u201cItems not approved for humanitarian organisations, such as generators, are available commercially. So we have a two-tier system, which is undermining the UN-led system, which Israel is required to support as per international law.\u201d\nUS forces deployed to the CMCC arrived in October prepared to launch a major logistics effort to get aid supplies into Gaza.\nThey were surprised and confused to find the biggest challenge was political, and began clashing with Israeli counterparts over some of the restrictions almost immediately, said multiple sources briefed on meetings at the base.\nAn early confrontation was over tent poles. Shelter is a critical need as winter sets in because Israeli attacks have destroyed nine out of 10 Palestinian homes, but Israel deems metal tent poles needed for sturdy winter-proof tents \u201cdual use\u201d.\nUS officers at the CMCC rapidly drew up a list of at least a dozen key humanitarian items they wanted removed from the dual-use list, with tent poles near the top. Weeks later Israel has not lifted restrictions on any of them.\n\u201cIt is clearly not security interests that are driving decision-making here,\u201d said one western source. \u201cThe dual-use list is just another way to control what enters Gaza.\u201d\nRestrictions on the type and quantity of goods allowed into Gaza long preceded the current war. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from the territory in 2005 but maintained effective control of the borders and used that to impose a blockade.\n\u201cIt has always been a form of control over the wellbeing of the population,\u201d said the Gisha director, Hary. \u201cWhether that\u2019s the bare minimum of humanitarian standards we are looking at now, or in previous years in terms of economic life, construction, industry, development in technology and agriculture and innovation.\u201d\nThe dual-use list, which requires a security assessment and permits to import items to Gaza, has been a particular concern since it was introduced.\nIt is sweeping in its scope, secret until an item is rejected and has been imposed arbitrarily. Older versions obtained by Gisha through legal action include categories such as \u201ccommunications equipment\u201d \u2013 so broad it could cover most modern electronics.\nItems barred on dual-use grounds over the last two years include solar panels, smoke detectors, crutches, wheelchairs and walkers.\nAid groups have collaborated to compile an unofficial list of rejected items in an effort to limit the amount of time and money spent applying to import things that are unlikely to get approval. But it is time consuming.\nInternational pressure on Israel over the dual-use list has also flagged over the last two years, and even with the creation of the CMCC.\nDiplomats are concerned about spiralling violence in the West Bank and uncertainty about long-term plans for Gaza\u2019s reconstruction, as aid groups are negotiating possible de-registration by Israel.\nThe dual-use list is not the only bureaucratic obstacle limiting the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Some items are banned because Israel has decided they don\u2019t address urgent humanitarian needs.\nThis category includes paper and pencils to restart schools after two years without education for 600,000 children, and frozen beef and mutton to feed a malnourished population. Aid organisations have been limited to chicken while commercial traders have been able to bring in all kinds of meat.\nThe limited number of crossings into Gaza and their hours of operation, as well as delays approving routes for convoys inside the territory \u2013 which is vital to ensuring they do not come under Israeli attack \u2013 all serve to slow the entry of vital supplies.\nOverall flows of aid into Gaza are well below levels agreed under the ceasefire, data provided by the Israeli military and analysed by the Associated Press showed.\nFood shipments have increased enough to stave off famine, but hunger is still widespread, UN-backed food security experts said last week. About 1.6 million people were expected to face \u201ccrisis\u201d levels of hunger in the next four months and if the ceasefire broke down, the territory could slip back into famine.\nWinter weather and lack of shelter are exacerbating the impact of long-term malnutrition, particularly on young children. At least three have been killed by hypothermia this month, the UN said.",

    "content": "Alborz, a textile merchant in the central Iranian city of Isfahan, decided he could no longer sit on the sidelines. He closed his shop and took to the streets, joining merchants across Iran who shuttered their stores and students who took over their campuses to protest against declining economic conditions.\nThe sudden loss of purchasing power pushed Alborz and tens of thousands of other Iranians into the streets, where protests are now entering their fourth day. Students have paralysed university campuses, traders have shut down their stores and demonstrators have blocked off streets in defiance of police. Protests have spread from the capital, Tehran, to cities across Iran.\nDespite the risk of being jailed for his political activism, the father of four had run out of options. On Sunday, the national currency plunged to a historic low, putting further pressure on Alborz, who was already struggling to provide for his family.\n\u201cWhat will my children eat? Do we have to bring suitcases of cash to simply buy bread? Do you find that normal?\u201d Alborz told the Guardian over the phone, speaking under a pseudonym for fear of security reprisals.\nThe unprecedented depreciation of the national currency on Sunday \u2013 when the Iranian rial dropped to 1.42m to the US dollar, a more than 56% decrease in value in six months \u2013 was a breaking point for an already struggling economy and population. The plunging currency has caused soaring inflation, with food prices up by 72% on average compared with the same time last year.\nIran is also under some of the world\u2019s most intense sanctions, which have spurred inflation as the country struggles to access frozen funds abroad and foreign exchange, something exacerbated by its growing reliance on imports.\nThe protests are the largest in Iran since 2022, when Iranians erupted in anger at the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after being arrested for not wearing her hijab properly. Those protests were violently quashed and ultimately simmered out.\nSocial media in Iran has been filled with videos of protesters chanting anti-government slogans and throwing stones at security forces. In one video from Tehran, a lone man sits blocking the way of security services on motorbikes as crowds of protesters flee from teargas.\nThough the protests started as demonstrations against deteriorating living conditions, they have widened to express grievances at the way Iran is being governed. Women\u2019s rights activists, shopkeepers and students have begun chanting \u201cdeath to the dictator\u201d and \u201cwoman, life, freedom\u201d \u2013 slogans that could put people in prison.\nAlborz said: \u201cFor years now, we have slowly but surely made significant changes to our lifestyles because of this corrupt government. This was the last nail in the coffin.

    "content_clean": "Alborz, a textile merchant in the central Iranian city of Isfahan, decided he could no longer sit on the sidelines. He closed his shop and took to the streets, joining merchants across Iran who shuttered their stores and students who took over their campuses to protest against declining economic conditions. The sudden loss of purchasing power pushed Alborz and tens of thousands of other Iranians into the streets, where protests are now entering their fourth day. Students have paralysed university campuses, traders have shut down their stores and demonstrators have blocked off streets in defiance of police. Protests have spread from the capital, Tehran, to cities across Iran. Despite the risk of being jailed for his political activism, the father of four had run out of options. On Sunday, the national currency plunged to a historic low, putting further pressure on Alborz, who was already struggling to provide for his family. \u201cWhat will my children eat? Do we have to bring suitcases of cash to simply buy bread? Do you find that normal?\u201d Alborz told the Guardian over the phone, speaking under a pseudonym for fear of security reprisals. The unprecedented depreciation of the national currency on Sunday \u2013 when the Iranian rial dropped to 1.42m to the US dollar, a more than 56% decrease in value in six months \u2013 was a breaking point for an already struggling economy and population. The plunging currency has caused soaring inflation, with food prices up by 72% on average compared with the same time last year. Iran is also under some of the world\u2019s most intense sanctions, which have spurred inflation as the country struggles to access frozen funds abroad and foreign exchange, something exacerbated by its growing reliance on imports. The protests are the largest in Iran since 2022, when Iranians erupted in anger at the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after being arrested for not wearing her hijab properly. Those protests were violently quashed and ultimately simmered out. Social media in Iran has been filled with videos of protesters chanting anti-government slogans and throwing stones at security forces. In one video from Tehran, a lone man sits blocking the way of security services on motorbikes as crowds of protesters flee from teargas. Though the protests started as demonstrations against deteriorating living conditions, they have widened to express grievances at the way Iran is being governed. Women\u2019s rights activists, shopkeepers and students have begun chanting \u201cdeath to the dictator\u201d and \u201cwoman, life, freedom\u201d \u2013 slogans that could put people in prison. Alborz said: \u201cFor years now, we have slowly but surely made significant changes to our lifestyles because of this corrupt government. This was the last nail in the coffin. We wanted this regime gone and now there\u2019s no way this regime will continue.\u201d The government, still shaken from a brutal 12-day war with Israel in June which rocked the foundations of the Iranian regime, has called for dialogue with protest leaders.

    "content": "People from ethnic minority backgrounds in England are less likely to have access to the latest diabetes technology, despite being more likely to live with the condition, according to analysis.\nDevices such as a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) can help people check their blood glucose levels in order to better manage the disease.\nWithout this technology, people with diabetes are left with much less efficient and inconvenient ways of managing their blood sugar levels, such as through finger pricking.\nThe study, published in the journal Diabetic Medicine, found significant disparities in access to continuous glucose monitors, with people from black and south Asian backgrounds facing lower prescribing rates per 1,000 people.\nPeople from ethnic minority backgrounds made up 17.5% of the population served by integrated care boards (ICBs) with lower than average prescribing rate for CGMs in 2024. By contrast, ethnic minorities only made up to 5.3% of the populationin ICBs with a higher than average prescribing rate.\nAbout 5.8 million people across the UK live with diabetes, while people from black and south Asian backgrounds in particular are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes by the age of 25.\nSamuel Seidu, the lead author and a professor in primary care diabetes and cardio-metabolic medicine at the University of Leicester, said the study was the \u201cfirst national analysis in England to demonstrate, with robust prescribing data, that significant ethnic inequalities exist in access to continuous glucose monitoring across both type 1 and type 2 diabetes\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cThe disparity is not entirely surprising, although it is concerning as previous research internationally (especially in the US) has repeatedly shown lower adoption of diabetes technologies in minority ethnic groups.\n\u201cIn the UK, minority groups already experience higher diabetes prevalence and worse cardiometabolic outcomes, suggesting structural inequities in care access.

    "content_clean": "People from ethnic minority backgrounds in England are less likely to have access to the latest diabetes technology, despite being more likely to live with the condition, according to analysis. Devices such as a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) can help people check their blood glucose levels in order to better manage the disease. Without this technology, people with diabetes are left with much less efficient and inconvenient ways of managing their blood sugar levels, such as through finger pricking. The study, published in the journal Diabetic Medicine, found significant disparities in access to continuous glucose monitors, with people from black and south Asian backgrounds facing lower prescribing rates per 1,000 people. People from ethnic minority backgrounds made up 17.5% of the population served by integrated care boards (ICBs) with lower than average prescribing rate for CGMs in 2024. By contrast, ethnic minorities only made up to 5.3% of the populationin ICBs with a higher than average prescribing rate. About 5.8 million people across the UK live with diabetes, while people from black and south Asian backgrounds in particular are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes by the age of 25. Samuel Seidu, the lead author and a professor in primary care diabetes and cardio-metabolic medicine at the University of Leicester, said the study was the \u201cfirst national analysis in England to demonstrate, with robust prescribing data, that significant ethnic inequalities exist in access to continuous glucose monitoring across both type 1 and type 2 diabetes\u201d. He added: \u201cThe disparity is not entirely surprising, although it is concerning as previous research internationally (especially in the US) has repeatedly shown lower adoption of diabetes technologies in minority ethnic groups. \u201cIn the UK, minority groups already experience higher diabetes prevalence and worse cardiometabolic outcomes, suggesting structural inequities in care access. Ethnicity and deprivation together account for up to 77% of variance in CGM prescribing in type 2 diabetes, meaning structural inequities are deeply embedded.\u201d According to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidelines, all adults with type 1 and 2 diabetes should have access to diabetes technology, including a CGM device.

    "content": "A cold, bright afternoon in the Vale of Pewsey and a couple of brown hares were nibbling away in a field of winter barley. It was a tranquil scene in this tucked-away corner of the English West Country but tyre tracks cutting through the crop were a sign of the violence that takes place when night falls.\nThis is one of the hotspots in Wiltshire for hare coursing, in which criminal gangs set dogs \u2013 usually greyhounds or lurchers \u2013 on the mammals.\nTypically, bets are placed on how many \u201cturns\u201d it will take for the hound to catch and kill a hare, with some chases livestreamed so that gamblers across the world can take part.\nWiltshire police, one of the UK police forces leading the fight against the coursers, say hare coursing gangs are terrorising the countryside. \u201cI fear it\u2019s only a matter of time before a farmer or landowner here is seriously injured defending their property,\u201d said Insp Andy Lemon, the tactical lead for rural crime in Wiltshire.\nHe cautioned against farmers \u201ctaking matters into their own hands and hitting back\u201d, saying: \u201cWe tell them: please don\u2019t \u2013 call us. But the concern is that a farmer will lose it.\u201d\nOver the past year, hare coursing and poaching offences rose by more than 20% in Wiltshire. Since January 2025, 30 people have been arrested over the offences \u2013 a 500% increase compared with 2024.\nBut many more are not caught. Gang members travel from across the UK to Wiltshire, which offers particularly good country for the crime as once the autumn harvest is complete, expanses of open fields are exposed, leaving the hares little cover.\n\u201cThis is their playground,\u201d said Lemon, who took the Guardian out to see some of the spots favoured by the coursers. \u201cWe think hare coursing is probably taking place somewhere in the county every day.\u201d\nThe areas the coursers like tend to be crisscrossed by paths, bridleways and byways, making good spots accessible to determined criminals with four-wheel drive vehicles.\nIf they can get there in time, the force sends armed officers, drone operators and road traffic teams, but the offenders are good at slipping away. \u201cWhen they go off road, it can be like looking for a needle in a haystack,\u201d said Lemon.\nHe suggested that while forces such as Wiltshire and Lincolnshire were actively tackling the coursers, the crime was taking place wherever there were hares. \u201cSome police forces say they don\u2019t have a problem. I think they do \u2013 they just don\u2019t know about it.\u201d\nOne Vale of Pewsey farmer showed the Guardian the defences landowners were putting in place to try to keep the coursers away, including troughs filled with concrete and fallen trees placed across field gates. \u201cBut they find their way in,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey smash through gates and fences. They don\u2019t care and in fact I think they get a kick out of being chased and getting away. There\u2019s big money involved. They bet thousands of pounds and the dogs are worth tens of thousands. This is a crisis for us.\u201d\nAnother local farmer said his land was used for coursing 10 times in one month. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent an absolute fortune on ditching and fencing, extra CCTV and lighting,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery single night, I go out and drive the perimeter of the farm to make sure gates are still locked and fences are still up and there are no lights where there shouldn\u2019t be lights. My wife has a bit of a moment every time I leave.\u201d\nThere have been some nasty incidents. One Wiltshire farm worker suffered leg and hand injuries when he was knocked to the ground by a car after confronting suspected hare coursers.\nA barn was set alight after one farmer chased off coursers and three cows were killed in a road accident after fencing was destroyed by suspected coursers as they accessed a field.\nA video was circulated \u2013 by coursers, apparently as a warning shot \u2013 of a farmer being surrounded at night by vehicles in his field. They circled him and rammed his car.\nAnother Vale of Pewsey farmer said the success of conservation work to improve conditions for hares was one reason the crime was on the rise. \u201cThere\u2019s been a rise in the number of hares \u2013 and with that has come an increase in hare coursing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of some farmers thinking of shooting hares to stop hare coursing, which is so sad.\u201d\nPhilip Wilkinson, the police and crime commissioner for Wiltshire and Swindon and a board member of the National Rural Crime Network, said: \u201cWe\u2019re being hammered, terrorised.\u201d\nWilkinson, who served in the British army for 32 years, is determined to clamp down on the coursers. \u201cWe will send out armed response teams, traffic [officers] \u2013 anybody. We\u2019ll pile in to try and catch the buggers.\u201d\nHe said hare coursers were enmeshed in international criminal networks. He had watched coursing being livestreamed into China and had seen intelligence that many involved in the activity were also responsible for the theft of farm equipment, from tools to expensive vehicles, some of which was smuggled to eastern Europe.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the ends of the tentacles. If you swim upstream through those networks, if you go far enough, you get to China and eastern Europe. It\u2019s all overlapped and linked.\u201d\nFrequently, those who defy coursers find animal corpses dumped close to their homes or businesses. \u201cA line of dead hares was put across the end of my lane,\u201d said Wilkinson. \u201cThey\u2019re sticking two fingers up at us.\u201d\nBut the impact is not just economic. It is a cruel sport to the hares and to some of the dogs. \u201cYou\u2019re essentially testing the fitness of your dog against the fitness of a wild animal, the hare,\u201d said David Bowles, the RSPCA\u2019s head of public affairs. \u201cAnd the end result is inevitably that the dog catches the hare and rips it to bits.\u201d\nHare coursing was outlawed in the Hunting Act 2004 and the ban has been stiffened recently with stronger sentences and more powers to seize dogs.\nBowles said police forces such as in Wiltshire and Lincolnshire were working with organisations such as the RSPCA, the National Farmers\u2019 Union and the Countryside Alliance. \u201cI think you\u2019re starting to see the first signs of the crackdown actually starting to work during 2025,\u201d he said.\nWiltshire council said it had seen an increase in the number of dogs associated with hare coursing that were being abandoned. In a three-month period in 2025, it collected 20 lurcher-type dogs. Some were underweight and injured, while only three were claimed by owners.\nShortly after Lemon left the Vale of Pewsey on his way back to police headquarters in Devizes, his radio crackled. Dogs had been found in a car on Salisbury Plain. \u201cProbably hare coursing,\u201d he said. The daily hunt for the coursers was beginning again.",

    "content": "Health visitors will be sent door-to-door to deliver vaccines to children in England amid alarm that one in five start primary school with no protection against deadly diseases, the Guardian can reveal.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that at least 95% of children should receive vaccine doses for each illness to achieve herd immunity. However, not a single one of the main childhood vaccines in England hit the target in 2024-25. There were also sharp differences in uptake across the country.\nIn an effort to tackle the crisis, health visitors will begin offering a range of life-saving jabs to children in their own homes as part of a \u00a32m pilot scheme starting in January.\nHealth visitors are nurses or midwives that specialise in working with families with children under five to identify health needs as early as possible. Under the scheme, they will target families who are not signed up with a GP or who struggle with travel costs, childcare, language barriers or other issues stopping them seeing a doctor.\nChildren will be identified by the NHS using GP records, health visitor notes and local databases, sources said. Health visitors will be trained to administer vaccines safely and have tricky conversations with parents, including those with doubts about vaccine safety.\nTwelve pilot areas will launch in January across five regions of England \u2013 London, the Midlands, the north-east and Yorkshire, the north-west and the south-west \u2013 aimed at boosting uptake and protecting children against diseases. If successful, the scheme will roll out everywhere in 2027.\nWes Streeting, the health secretary, said: \u201cEvery parent deserves the chance to protect their child from preventable diseases, but some families have a lot going on and that can mean they miss out.\n\u201cHealth visitors are already trusted faces in communities across the country. By allowing them to offer vaccinations, we\u2019re using the relationships and expertise that already exist to reach families who need support most.\n\u201cFixing the NHS means tackling health inequalities head-on. By meeting families where they are, we\u2019re not just boosting vaccination rates \u2013 we\u2019re building a health service that works for everyone.\u201d\nThe child vaccine drive comes as the NHS remains under \u201cextraordinary pressure\u201d amid high rates of flu and other winter bugs. Health leaders are braced for a surge in cases in the next few days as temperatures plummet.\nHalf a million more people in England have had the flu jab compared with the previous year. But health officials said on Wednesday it was not too late for unvaccinated people to protect themselves for the rest of winter.\nThe move to send health visitors with vaccines direct to children\u2019s homes comes amid serious concern about uptake in England.\nOnly 91.9% of five-year-olds received one dose of the MMR (measles, mumps & rubella) vaccine in 2024-25, the lowest level since 2010-11, according to UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data reviewed by the Guardian.\nJust 83.7% of five-year-olds had received both MMR doses, down year-on-year from 83.9% and the lowest level since 2009-10. Uptake of the first MMR dose at 24 months stood at 88.9% in 2024-25 \u2013 again the lowest figure since 2009-10.\nIn July a child died in Liverpool after contracting measles, the first such death in the UK in a decade. Only 73% of children in Liverpool have received the necessary two shots to protect against measles.\nThe UK is the worst of the G7 nations regarding MMR vaccination uptake, according to the WHO: as of 2024 only 89% of children had received their first MMR jab. Globally, millions of children are at risk of lethal diseases owing to vaccine coverage having stalled or reversed, according to the largest study of its kind.\nCoverage for the Hib/MenC vaccine, which protects against Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningitis C, stood at 88.9% for five-year-olds in England, the lowest level since 2011-12.\nMeanwhile, uptake of the four-in-one preschool booster vaccine \u2013 which protects against polio, whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria \u2013 was just 81.4% among five-year-olds in 2024-25.\nIt means about one in five are unprotected when starting primary school, and represents the worst uptake since current records began in 2009-10.\nFrom Friday, a vaccine for chickenpox will be rolled out on the NHS across England.\nThe jab, which costs about \u00a3150 at private clinics and pharmacies, will form part of a new combined immunisation on the childhood vaccination programme.\nMinisters hope it will not only protect some youngsters from severe complications from the virus, but also prevent parents taking time off work to look after their children if they become infected.\nThe chickenpox vaccine \u2013 also known as the varicella jab \u2013 will form part of a new combined MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella and varicella) vaccine.\nIt will be offered at GP practices from Friday, and is expected to offer protection to about 500,000 children every year. The MMRV will eventually replace the MMR, which is offered to babies at 12 months and 18 months.",

Boebert, a longtime Maga ally and supporter of the president, said in a statement to a local news station: \u201cI sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability.\u201d\nTrump also vetoed a second bill on Tuesday for a project in Florida. The measure aimed to spend $14m to protect an area known as Osceola Camp within Everglades national park that is inhabited by members of the Miccosukee Tribe of Native Americans. The tribe has fought Trump\u2019s makeshift immigrant detention center \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d. A federal judge has now ordered the detention center to be shut down.\nTrump said the tribe was never authorized to inhabit the Osceola Camp area, and that his administration would not support projects for special interests, especially those \u201cunaligned\u201d with his immigration policies.\nTrump\u2019s vetoes were the first two of his second term.\nThe veto of the Colorado bill came after Trump\u2019s vow to retaliate against Colorado for keeping his ally Tina Peters in prison, despite his attempt to pardon her earlier in the month.\nPeters, a former Colorado county clerk, is serving a nine-year prison term after being convicted on state charges for illegally tampering with voting machines in the 2020 presidential election. The charges against Peters were brought under Colorado state law, and so are exempt from a Trump pardon, which can only cover federal charges.\nIt was not immediately clear whether the Republican leaders in Congress would allow a vote to override Trump\u2019s veto in Colorado. Boebert was one of four Republican lawmakers, along with Marjorie Taylor Greene, who played a key role in forcing the release of justice department files on Epstein. Trump fought the release of the files for months before ending his opposition.\nIn her statement to Colorado\u2019s 9News, Boebert said: \u201cNothing says \u2018America First\u2019 like denying clean drinking water to 50,000 people in Southeast Colorado many of whom enthusiastically voted for him all three elections ...

O\u2019Neill declared that the department had \u201cactivated our defend-the-spend system for all ACF childcare payments across America\u201d and would now require \u201cjustification, receipt or photo evidence before we make a payment\u201d.\nOriginally, O\u2019Neill and Adams\u2019s message was interpreted as an announcement that HHS would stop childcare funding in Minnesota, not all 50 states. However, the Associated Press reported late Wednesday that the freeze would apply to every state and that all states would need to provide more documentation about their childcare programs before receiving federal money.\nThe department did not immediately reply to a Guardian request for comment to clarify the nature of the freeze, but HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told ABC News that \u201cit\u2019s the onus of the state to make sure that these funds, these federal dollars, taxpayer dollars, are being used for legitimate purposes\u201d.\nRecipients of childcare funding will have to provide HHS with extensive documentation, such as \u201cattendance records, licensing, inspection and monitoring reports, complaints and investigations\u201d, Nixon added.\nThe changes to US childcare services as part of a response to a viral video, made by a self-described \u201cindependent journalist\u201d and rightwing influencer, that purported to discover massive fraud at daycare centers operated by Somali Americans in Minneapolis.\nHowever, other news outlets have not been able to verify the claims made in the video. Allegations of exploitation of Minnesota\u2019s social safety net have also been extensively covered by local and national news media over the past several years, and prosecutors brought charges over one allegedly massive scheme during the Biden administration.\nIn recent weeks, Trump has intensified his xenophobic attacks on Somali Americans, including his long-running nemesis Ilhan Omar, a representative from Minnesota who is Somali American and came to the US as a refugee. He has said that Omar is \u201cgarbage\u201d and said Somalia is \u201cno good for a reason\u201d.\n\u201cWhen they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don\u2019t want them in our country,\u201d Trump said in one December cabinet meeting. \u201cLet them go back to where they came from and fix it.\u201d\nTim Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota who is running for re-election this year, denounced the Trump administration\u2019s freeze of Minnesota\u2019s funding as part of \u201cTrump\u2019s long game\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent years cracking down on fraudsters.

    "content": "Donald Trump has staged a sudden climbdown from his attempts to impose federal troops in law enforcement roles on Democratic-run cities, announcing on Wednesday that he was ending attempted deployments from Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland.\nThe unexpected shift came after justice department lawyers said they were no longer contesting a California court\u2019s ruling that returned the national guard troops to the authority of Gavin Newsom, the state\u2019s governor. It also followed a rare rebuke from the US supreme court, which blocked the White House\u2019s efforts to deploy national guards in Illinois.\nTrump attempted to paint the decision as temporary in a post on his Truth Social platform, vowing to redeploy at a later date and insisting the initiative had been a success.\n\u201cWe are removing the National Guard from Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland, despite the fact that CRIME has been greatly reduced by having these great Patriots in those cities, and ONLY by that fact,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cPortland, Los Angeles, and Chicago were GONE if it weren\u2019t for the Federal Government stepping in. We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again \u2013 Only a question of time!\u201d\nYet there seemed little doubt that the latest move amounted to a retreat. Earlier on Wednesday, Newsom had hailed the justice department\u2019s decision, announced in a filing with the ninth circuit court of appeals, backing away from its argument that Trump had a right to put state national guard troops under his authority indefinitely.\n\u201cThis admission by Trump and his occult cabinet members means this illegal intimidation tactic will finally come to an end,\u201d wrote Newsom, who vocally and vigorously opposed the deployments on the streets of Los Angeles.\nIn a statement on Wednesday evening, Newsom said he had directed California national guard leaders to \u201creturn state service members home to be with their families as soon as possible\u201d.\nTrump initially ordered national guard members into the city last June in response to protests against raids conduced by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The deployment has been subject to a succession of legal challenges, with Newsom arguing that the situation did not justify the presence of federal forces and that Trump was exceeding his powers.\nA lower court ruled earlier this month that Trump had seized control of the national guard members illegally and ordered them returned to state authority. The administration had originally contested that ruling.\nIts change of tack amounted to the second setback in a week to Trump\u2019s quest to federalize national guard units to quell displays of dissent against his highly contentious immigration policies, which he and other administration figures have depicted as violent riots.\nLast week, the US supreme court delivered a rare rebuke by refusing to allow the administration to deploy national guards in Chicago \u2013 a move opposed by the city\u2019s mayor, Brandon Johnson, and the governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, who are both Democrats.\nTrump\u2019s announcement casts doubts on the future of national guard deployments in other Democratic-run cities, including Washington DC and New Orleans, where 350 troops were expected to arrive by New Year\u2019s Eve.\nTroops have been deployed in Washington DC since last August, purportedly to counteract a supposed \u201ccrime wave\u201d. One national guard was killed and another seriously wounded after being shot by a gunman outside a metro station in the city on 26 November.\nThe incident led to an increase in the number guard members deployed in Washington, as well as an intensification of Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric after it emerged that the suspected assailant was an Afghan national who had been granted political asylum in the US. More than 2,000 troops have been deployed in Washington DC since August, with many being drafted in from at least 11 Republican-led states.\nA federal appeals court ruled this month that the troops can remain while a panel of judges establish whether their deployment is legal. A lower court had earlier ordered that they be removed.",

    "content_clean": "Donald Trump has staged a sudden climbdown from his attempts to impose federal troops in law enforcement roles on Democratic-run cities, announcing on Wednesday that he was ending attempted deployments from Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland. The unexpected shift came after justice department lawyers said they were no longer contesting a California court\u2019s ruling that returned the national guard troops to the authority of Gavin Newsom, the state\u2019s governor. It also followed a rare rebuke from the US supreme court, which blocked the White House\u2019s efforts to deploy national guards in Illinois. Trump attempted to paint the decision as temporary in a post on his Truth Social platform, vowing to redeploy at a later date and insisting the initiative had been a success. \u201cWe are removing the National Guard from Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland, despite the fact that CRIME has been greatly reduced by having these great Patriots in those cities, and ONLY by that fact,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPortland, Los Angeles, and Chicago were GONE if it weren\u2019t for the Federal Government stepping in. We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again \u2013 Only a question of time!\u201d Yet there seemed little doubt that the latest move amounted to a retreat. Earlier on Wednesday, Newsom had hailed the justice department\u2019s decision, announced in a filing with the ninth circuit court of appeals, backing away from its argument that Trump had a right to put state national guard troops under his authority indefinitely. \u201cThis admission by Trump and his occult cabinet members means this illegal intimidation tactic will finally come to an end,\u201d wrote Newsom, who vocally and vigorously opposed the deployments on the streets of Los Angeles. In a statement on Wednesday evening, Newsom said he had directed California national guard leaders to \u201creturn state service members home to be with their families as soon as possible\u201d. Trump initially ordered national guard members into the city last June in response to protests against raids conduced by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The deployment has been subject to a succession of legal challenges, with Newsom arguing that the situation did not justify the presence of federal forces and that Trump was exceeding his powers. A lower court ruled earlier this month that Trump had seized control of the national guard members illegally and ordered them returned to state authority. The administration had originally contested that ruling. Its change of tack amounted to the second setback in a week to Trump\u2019s quest to federalize national guard units to quell displays of dissent against his highly contentious immigration policies, which he and other administration figures have depicted as violent riots. Last week, the US supreme court delivered a rare rebuke by refusing to allow the administration to deploy national guards in Chicago \u2013 a move opposed by the city\u2019s mayor, Brandon Johnson, and the governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, who are both Democrats. Trump\u2019s announcement casts doubts on the future of national guard deployments in other Democratic-run cities, including Washington DC and New Orleans, where 350 troops were expected to arrive by New Year\u2019s Eve. Troops have been deployed in Washington DC since last August, purportedly to counteract a supposed \u201ccrime wave\u201d. One national guard was killed and another seriously wounded after being shot by a gunman outside a metro station in the city on 26 November. The incident led to an increase in the number guard members deployed in Washington, as well as an intensification of Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric after it emerged that the suspected assailant was an Afghan national who had been granted political asylum in the US. More than 2,000 troops have been deployed in Washington DC since August, with many being drafted in from at least 11 Republican-led states. A federal appeals court ruled this month that the troops can remain while a panel of judges establish whether their deployment is legal. A lower court had earlier ordered that they be removed.",

    "content": "The Green party leader, Zack Polanski, has said he would refuse to work with Keir Starmer but could work with Andy Burnham, Starmer\u2019s potential rival for the Labour leadership, to keep Reform out of power.\nPolanski said he would not enter a political partnership with Labour under the current prime minister, but would consider it if the mayor of Greater Manchester took the helm.\nHe told the Financial Times: \u201cI could see the potential to work with Andy Burnham to stop Reform and to challenge the rise of the far right. I would rule it out with Keir Starmer, but I wouldn\u2019t rule it out with Burnham.\u201d\nA coalition would require the Greens getting an adequate number of seats at the next general election to make the party useful to Labour, and would also need Burnham to once again gain a seat as an MP.\nPolanski argued Labour\u2019s plan for the economy was not working. He called for a wealth tax, as well as an increase in capital gains tax to bring it in line with income tax. \u201cI am challenging a broken, failed economic model, and the people defending it have no answer other than just to continue with what is broken,\u201d he said.\nHowever, Gary Lineker defended the prime minister in an interview with Polanski, saying he had met Starmer \u201ctwo or three times\u201d and he \u201cseemed a very nice guy\u201d.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s having a tough time. Obviously he\u2019s not a hugely charismatic leader, but I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s important,\u201d the football pundit and TV presenter said.\nSpeaking on the podcast Bold Politics with Zack Polanski, Lineker also said there was \u201ctoo much political influence from the very top\u201d of the BBC, and the organisation had \u201ctied itself up in knots\u201d over impartiality.\nThe former Match of the Day presenter, who quit the BBC earlier this year, said he had a \u201cgreat affinity\u201d with the institution but: \u201cI think they\u2019ve got a little bit broad into this whole impartiality thing and I think that that makes it very, very difficult for them.\u201d\nLineker said in recent years, impartiality had been expanded beyond news and current affairs and into the rest of the BBC. \u201cEven though we\u2019d been on social media for years, we were expected to suddenly change.

    "content_clean": "The Green party leader, Zack Polanski, has said he would refuse to work with Keir Starmer but could work with Andy Burnham, Starmer\u2019s potential rival for the Labour leadership, to keep Reform out of power. Polanski said he would not enter a political partnership with Labour under the current prime minister, but would consider it if the mayor of Greater Manchester took the helm. He told the Financial Times: \u201cI could see the potential to work with Andy Burnham to stop Reform and to challenge the rise of the far right. I would rule it out with Keir Starmer, but I wouldn\u2019t rule it out with Burnham.\u201d A coalition would require the Greens getting an adequate number of seats at the next general election to make the party useful to Labour, and would also need Burnham to once again gain a seat as an MP. Polanski argued Labour\u2019s plan for the economy was not working. He called for a wealth tax, as well as an increase in capital gains tax to bring it in line with income tax. \u201cI am challenging a broken, failed economic model, and the people defending it have no answer other than just to continue with what is broken,\u201d he said. However, Gary Lineker defended the prime minister in an interview with Polanski, saying he had met Starmer \u201ctwo or three times\u201d and he \u201cseemed a very nice guy\u201d. \u201cI think he\u2019s having a tough time. Obviously he\u2019s not a hugely charismatic leader, but I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s important,\u201d the football pundit and TV presenter said. Speaking on the podcast Bold Politics with Zack Polanski, Lineker also said there was \u201ctoo much political influence from the very top\u201d of the BBC, and the organisation had \u201ctied itself up in knots\u201d over impartiality. The former Match of the Day presenter, who quit the BBC earlier this year, said he had a \u201cgreat affinity\u201d with the institution but: \u201cI think they\u2019ve got a little bit broad into this whole impartiality thing and I think that that makes it very, very difficult for them.\u201d Lineker said in recent years, impartiality had been expanded beyond news and current affairs and into the rest of the BBC. \u201cEven though we\u2019d been on social media for years, we were expected to suddenly change. And I thought that was difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, there are thousands and thousands and thousands of people that work for the BBC that are really, really good people that do excellent jobs. But I think it\u2019s tied itself up in knots a little bit with the impartiality thing because I think what we really need is truth and reporting, in that sense.

    "content": "The European court of human rights has questioned the UK government over its 2019 decision to remove Shamima Begum\u2019s British citizenship.\nLawyers in Europe have asked how Begum\u2019s treatment complies with the UK\u2019s responsibilities to victims of trafficking.\nThe intervention has encouraged Begum\u2019s lawyers and fuelled Conservative and Reform accusations of meddling by foreign judges and their calls to leave European human rights treaty.\nIn 2015, as a 15-year-old schoolgirl, Begum left her east London home and travelled with two friends to live under territory held by Islamic State (IS). She was \u201cmarried off\u201d to an IS fighter with whom she had three children, all of whom died in infancy.\nIn 2019, the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, revoked her citizenship on grounds of national security, in a decision upheld in the court of appeal last year and backed by the current government.\nCampaigners and Begum\u2019s lawyers argue she was the victim of child trafficking. Begum, now 26, remains stateless in a Syrian refugee camp.\nA document published by the European court this month confirms that Begum is challenging Javid\u2019s decision under article 4 of the European convention on human rights \u2013 a prohibition of slavery and forced labour.\nThe case was lodged in December 2024, after she was denied the chance to challenge the removal of her British citizenship at the UK\u2019s supreme court.\nAmong four questions posed by judges in Strasbourg to the Home Office, they asked: \u201cDid the secretary of state have a positive obligation, by virtue of article 4 of the convention, to consider whether the applicant had been a victim of trafficking and whether any duties or obligations to her flowed from that fact, before deciding to deprive her of her citizenship?\u201d\nBirnberg Peirce Solicitors, which is representing Begum, said the court\u2019s communication \u201cpresents an unprecedented opportunity\u201d for the UK and Begum to \u201cgrapple with the significant considerations raised in her case and ignored, sidestepped or violated up to now by previous UK administrations\u201d.\nOne of the lawyers, Gareth Peirce, said: \u201cIt is impossible to dispute that a 15-year-old British child was in 2014-15 lured, encouraged and deceived for the purposes of sexual exploitation to leave home and travel to [IS-controlled] territory for the known purpose of being given, as a child, to an [IS] fighter to propagate children for the Islamic State.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cIt is equally impossible not to acknowledge the catalogue of failures to protect a child known for weeks beforehand to be at high risk when a close friend had disappeared to Syria in an identical way and via an identical route.\n\u201cIt has already been long conceded that the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, who took the precipitous decision in 2019 very publicly to deprive Ms Begum of citizenship, had failed entirely to consider the issues of grooming and trafficking of a school child in London and of the state\u2019s consequent duties.\u201d\nPierce said the challenge came as the current government had made protections for victims of grooming and trafficking a national priority.\nA Home Office spokesperson said any decision made to protect national security would be robustly defended. They added: \u201cThe government will always protect the UK and its citizens. That is why Shamima Begum \u2013 who posed a national security threat \u2013 had her British citizenship revoked and is unable to return to the UK.\u201d\nThe shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, said Begum had \u201cno place\u201d in the UK because of her support for violent extremists. In a post on X, he wrote: \u201cIt is deeply concerning the European Court of Human Rights is now looking at using the ECHR to make the UK take her back.\u201d\nAlso on X, Richard Tice, Reform\u2019s deputy leader, wrote: \u201cECHR can jog on\u2026.none of their business \u2026just another reason why we must leave this foreign court.\u201d",

One of the lawyers, Gareth Peirce, said: \u201cIt is impossible to dispute that a 15-year-old British child was in 2014-15 lured, encouraged and deceived for the purposes of sexual exploitation to leave home and travel to [IS-controlled] territory for the known purpose of being given, as a child, to an [IS] fighter to propagate children for the Islamic State.\u201d She added: \u201cIt is equally impossible not to acknowledge the catalogue of failures to protect a child known for weeks beforehand to be at high risk when a close friend had disappeared to Syria in an identical way and via an identical route. \u201cIt has already been long conceded that the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, who took the precipitous decision in 2019 very publicly to deprive Ms Begum of citizenship, had failed entirely to consider the issues of grooming and trafficking of a school child in London and of the state\u2019s consequent duties.\u201d Pierce said the challenge came as the current government had made protections for victims of grooming and trafficking a national priority. A Home Office spokesperson said any decision made to protect national security would be robustly defended. They added: \u201cThe government will always protect the UK and its citizens. That is why Shamima Begum \u2013 who posed a national security threat \u2013 had her British citizenship revoked and is unable to return to the UK.\u201d The shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, said Begum had \u201cno place\u201d in the UK because of her support for violent extremists. In a post on X, he wrote: \u201cIt is deeply concerning the European Court of Human Rights is now looking at using the ECHR to make the UK take her back.\u201d Also on X, Richard Tice, Reform\u2019s deputy leader, wrote: \u201cECHR can jog on\u2026.none of their business \u2026just another reason why we must leave this foreign court.\u201d",

Two years earlier, he had been named by the ringleader, Shakil Chowdhury, as an alleged accomplice in Walker-Roberts\u2019s abuse but Greater Manchester police failed to follow up on this and closed the case.\nDozens of items recovered from Chowdhury\u2019s home, where Walker-Roberts says she was raped for hours by five men, were destroyed by officers or returned to Chowdhury. She was trafficked around the town to be abused by several groups of men after being kidnapped from a police station where she had tried to report an earlier assault.\nThe Guardian understands that Offender J is now unlikely to face charges in relation to Walker-Roberts\u2019s ordeal because the surviving forensic evidence does not link him to her abuse. Chowdhury, jailed for six years in 2007, remains the only man to be convicted in the case, but Walker-Roberts was told last month that officers were pursuing two outstanding suspects.\nSarwar Ali absconded after being charged with rape and has never been traced. Police are trying to identify a third man forensically linked to the case. The Guardian understands he appears not to have come to police attention before.\nWalker-Roberts said: \u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve been told I need to move on but how can I, when I don\u2019t have the answers? Most people get closure when they get a sentence but I\u2019ll never be at that stage, so for me the answers are closure.\u201d\nShe added that she \u201cgave up hope a long time ago\u201d that all of the men involved in her abuse would be brought to justice but feared they had attacked other victims. \u201cI\u2019m praying that others will come forward, I want others to get justice in one form or another,\u201d she said.\nAn internal police inquiry concluded in 2014 that Offender J\u2019s wife may have been spared his attack if forensic inquiries had been adequately conducted in Walker-Roberts\u2019s case.\nA review of the remaining forensic evidence during this investigation linked two other girls to Chowdhury\u2019s property. They were interviewed and said they\u2019d had sex with Chowdhury at his home when they were 16 but appear not to have made criminal complaints.\nA safeguarding review commissioned by Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said in 2022 it had been unable to assess the quality of the inquiries made after the original forensic submissions.\nIt added that Offender J\u2019s wife told police in 2011 that he had admitted to her that he had raped a 12-year-old. She said Offender J had kept newspaper clippings relating to Chowdhury\u2019s court case and subsequent conviction.\nThe information was passed to Operation Messenger, a now defunct multi-agency taskforce designed to combat child sexual exploitation in Oldham, but again was not acted on. The safeguarding review said this was a \u201cserious failure\u201d.\nIn 2007, 22 items of evidence from Chowdhury\u2019s home, including bedding and a towel, were returned to him via his solicitor, despite possible relevance to outstanding suspects. The following year, officers destroyed a further 24 items, including material from Chowdhury\u2019s car and the contents of his bin.\nWhen challenged by Walker-Roberts eight years later, the force was unable to provide a \u201cforensic strategy\u201d relating to her case.

    "content": "In 2003, long before the term \u201cgrooming gang\u201d entered the lexicon, social workers in Oldham noticed a disturbing pattern: girls from local children\u2019s homes were repeatedly going missing. Often, they were found in the same locations, being harboured by the same men. Each time the authorities thought they had got a grip on the problem, it reared its head again. By 2006, there were concerns that groups of offenders were targeting children at high schools. One girl, later referred to in court as Child X, fell into their clutches while truanting when she was 12 years old. By 14, she had been abused by 300 men and was addicted to crack cocaine and heroin.\n\u201cUnless you scratch below the surface you do not realise the enormity of the problem,\u201d Ruth Baldwin, then the executive director for young people and families at Oldham council, said in December 2006. \u201cWe are not talking about teenage relationships. These are men in their 20s, 30s, and beyond.\u201d\nAlmost two decades later, on New Year\u2019s Day 2025, the fate of girls in this former mill town on the eastern fringes of Manchester caught the attention of the world\u2019s richest man. GB News reported that the safeguarding minister, Jess Phillips, had told Oldham council the government would not fund a statutory inquiry into child sexual exploitation in the town. In response, Elon Musk said on X that Phillips should be in prison.\nThe media storm that resulted forced a reckoning on an issue that has come to haunt Britain, not least because of the apparent over-representation of men of Asian heritage in the gangs that plagued towns such as Oldham. Several inquiries have already established that a nervousness about race hampered the response in other parts of the country.\nMusk\u2019s intervention was controversial. He was criticised for spreading misinformation and weaponising the issue to fuel a far-right agenda. But it set in motion a chain of events that forced the government to commission a statutory national inquiry on grooming gangs, covering England and Wales. A central strand will focus on what went wrong in Oldham, and it will look at \u201chow ethnicity, religion or culture played a role in responses\u201d.\nAlthough Oldham council now accepts its failings and has welcomed the national inquiry, at first some officials were privately baffled by the scrutiny the town was receiving. For many years, Oldham had prided itself on a child sexual exploitation strategy that was seen as being ahead of its time.\nWhen Baldwin, who left Oldham council in 2007, first spoke of her concerns about teenagers being preyed on by older men the previous year, she announced a new taskforce designed to combat the problem. The project \u2013 involving the council, police, health services and the charity Barnardo\u2019s \u2013 was named Operation Messenger. It was seen as being so groundbreaking that it won a Greater Manchester police award for partnership working in its first year. Yet the accolades the project received obscured a troubling truth: Operation Messenger failed many of the girls it came into contact with.\nA safeguarding review, commissioned by the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, and published in 2022, concluded that \u201cthe quality of casework by both the police and social care\u201d working on Operation Messenger was \u201cgenerally very poor and characterised by a failure to appropriately initiate multi-agency child protection procedures when children were known to be at risk of significant harm\u201d.\nThe review found no evidence to substantiate social media rumours that the Labour-led council was covering up the scale of the problem to protect its vote among the town\u2019s Muslim population. Operation Messenger investigated alleged offenders from a range of racial backgrounds, including white men. However, exploitation by British Asian men \u2013 particularly those of Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage \u2013 formed a significant chunk of its caseload. Throughout the project\u2019s eight-year lifespan, the agencies involved wrestled with how to address the problem without fuelling the far right, perhaps mindful that Oldham had already been torn apart by racial division during the 2001 riots.\n\u201cSexual exploitation is a real issue, and we need to be addressing it,\u201d a 2011 memo from Greater Manchester police read. \u201cPeople feel strongly about this issue and there is the potential for it to escalate. There is the perception that there is a conspiracy of silence due to political correctness and that some areas are not dealing with the issue.\u201d\nPolice said in the same document that there was a \u201cneed to continue to provide support to the Messenger team\u201d but warned: \u201cFurther cases in Oldham might bring wider media interest and further exploitation of the issue by the BNP and English Defence League. There is therefore a risk of further demonstrations and the risk of increased hate crimes.\u201d It added that Muslim communities felt \u201cdemonised\u201d.\nOne victim referred to in Operation Messenger, Samantha Walker-Roberts, has expressed concern about her story being hijacked by far-right groups. She was 12 when she was kidnapped from a police station in October 2006, as she tried to report a sexual assault by a man in a nearby churchyard. She was then trafficked around the town to be abused by multiple men. She ended the night in a quiet cul-de-sac, at the home of Shakil Chowdhury, where she remembers being raped for hours by five men.\nOnly Chowdhury was convicted and vital forensic evidence that could have helped trace outstanding suspects was destroyed or returned to him via his solicitor. During his trial, Chowdhury named two accomplices, but police did not follow up this information, according to the 2022 safeguarding review. The men remained at large and, in 2009, one tried to murder his wife. In 2011, this man\u2019s wife told police he had confessed to raping a 12-year-old and had even kept newspaper clippings about Chowdhury\u2019s trial. Again, the Messenger team did not act.\nGreater Manchester police said in a statement that the treatment Walker-Roberts received was \u201cfar from the standard survivors can expect\u201d from the force today and added that it was pursuing \u201clong and complex investigations\u201d into historical child sexual exploitation, which include Walker-Roberts\u2019 case.\nWalker-Roberts, now 32, has campaigned for an independent inquiry in Oldham for more than five years and hopes it will help establish whether Chowdhury, a British citizen born in Bangladesh, and his accomplices could have been stopped before they attacked her. Many years after her ordeal she tracked down some of his former neighbours; she later told the council and the safeguarding review that they recalled a \u201cconveyor belt\u201d of children arriving at Chowdhury\u2019s house in taxis. Separate sources say at least one neighbour tried to alert the council before Chowdhury was arrested.\nOn another occasion, a few months before Walker-Roberts was targeted, the Guardian understands a 14-year-old girl, missing from a children\u2019s home 20 miles away in another county, was found in the street, apparently having just visited Chowdhury\u2019s house. Sources say a neighbour who helped return her to the home was later visited by detectives from another force, but Chowdhury appears to have escaped their inquiries unscathed.\nWhen police reviewed Walker-Roberts\u2019s case in 2014, surviving forensic evidence linked two teenage girls to Chowdhury\u2019s property. They were interviewed and said they\u2019d had sex with Chowdhury there when they were 16 but appear not to have made criminal complaints. The safeguarding review said this helped \u201csupport [Walker-Roberts\u2019s] later assertion\u201d that Chowdhury\u2019s home \u201cwas a place where young women were sexually exploited by Asian males\u201d.\nThere are also fears that senior officials didn\u2019t understand the complexities of child sexual exploitation. Peter Fahy, a former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, described Operation Messenger, which was closed and absorbed into a regional taskforce in 2014, as being focused on \u201cchild prostitution\u201d.\nThe story of Child X \u2013 the 12-year-old who went on to be abused by 300 men after she started skipping school \u2013 came to light when she stabbed one alleged offender in a row over money. The person the police pursued was an older teenager who had introduced the girl to the offenders. She was in her early 20s by the time she appeared in court. She was handed a 12-month suspended sentence and ordered to sign the sex offender register for 10 years for causing and arranging for a child to enter into prostitution.\nThe judge told the older girl she had avoided jail because her case was \u201cexceptional\u201d. \u201cYour life has not been too dissimilar to that of the girl,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had been subject to all manner of abuse.\u201d Whether her case really was exceptional may be a matter for the inquiry.\nA few months later, another case came before the same court. A 20-year-old defendant was sentenced to a 12-month supervision order for the repeated abduction of a girl from Oldham who had been abused by Asian men. The girl\u2019s ordeal had begun when she was 10 and the defendant was 16 with a \u201cboyfriend\u201d who took them out in cars to drink alcohol with other men. The Guardian sent a freedom of information request to Greater Manchester police, asking how many teenage girls had been arrested or charged by Operation Messenger, but the force said it would be too expensive to retrieve the data.\nWalker-Roberts, who was once described in files as \u201cattention-seeking\u201d when she disclosed her abuse to a social worker, hopes the Oldham strand of the inquiry will focus just as much on how victims like her were treated by the professionals employed to help them as it will on the cultural factors that could have led to them being abused. She said many were already vulnerable by the time they were targeted by grooming gangs, having experienced domestic or sexual abuse within their families.\n\u201cThey thought we were problem children causing chaos,\u201d she said. \u201cIn reality, we were being abused.

    "content_clean": "In 2003, long before the term \u201cgrooming gang\u201d entered the lexicon, social workers in Oldham noticed a disturbing pattern: girls from local children\u2019s homes were repeatedly going missing. Often, they were found in the same locations, being harboured by the same men. Each time the authorities thought they had got a grip on the problem, it reared its head again. By 2006, there were concerns that groups of offenders were targeting children at high schools. One girl, later referred to in court as Child X, fell into their clutches while truanting when she was 12 years old. By 14, she had been abused by 300 men and was addicted to crack cocaine and heroin. \u201cUnless you scratch below the surface you do not realise the enormity of the problem,\u201d Ruth Baldwin, then the executive director for young people and families at Oldham council, said in December 2006. \u201cWe are not talking about teenage relationships. These are men in their 20s, 30s, and beyond.\u201d Almost two decades later, on New Year\u2019s Day 2025, the fate of girls in this former mill town on the eastern fringes of Manchester caught the attention of the world\u2019s richest man. GB News reported that the safeguarding minister, Jess Phillips, had told Oldham council the government would not fund a statutory inquiry into child sexual exploitation in the town. In response, Elon Musk said on X that Phillips should be in prison. The media storm that resulted forced a reckoning on an issue that has come to haunt Britain, not least because of the apparent over-representation of men of Asian heritage in the gangs that plagued towns such as Oldham. Several inquiries have already established that a nervousness about race hampered the response in other parts of the country. Musk\u2019s intervention was controversial. He was criticised for spreading misinformation and weaponising the issue to fuel a far-right agenda. But it set in motion a chain of events that forced the government to commission a statutory national inquiry on grooming gangs, covering England and Wales. A central strand will focus on what went wrong in Oldham, and it will look at \u201chow ethnicity, religion or culture played a role in responses\u201d. Although Oldham council now accepts its failings and has welcomed the national inquiry, at first some officials were privately baffled by the scrutiny the town was receiving. For many years, Oldham had prided itself on a child sexual exploitation strategy that was seen as being ahead of its time. When Baldwin, who left Oldham council in 2007, first spoke of her concerns about teenagers being preyed on by older men the previous year, she announced a new taskforce designed to combat the problem. The project \u2013 involving the council, police, health services and the charity Barnardo\u2019s \u2013 was named Operation Messenger. It was seen as being so groundbreaking that it won a Greater Manchester police award for partnership working in its first year. Yet the accolades the project received obscured a troubling truth: Operation Messenger failed many of the girls it came into contact with. A safeguarding review, commissioned by the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, and published in 2022, concluded that \u201cthe quality of casework by both the police and social care\u201d working on Operation Messenger was \u201cgenerally very poor and characterised by a failure to appropriately initiate multi-agency child protection procedures when children were known to be at risk of significant harm\u201d. The review found no evidence to substantiate social media rumours that the Labour-led council was covering up the scale of the problem to protect its vote among the town\u2019s Muslim population. Operation Messenger investigated alleged offenders from a range of racial backgrounds, including white men. However, exploitation by British Asian men \u2013 particularly those of Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage \u2013 formed a significant chunk of its caseload. Throughout the project\u2019s eight-year lifespan, the agencies involved wrestled with how to address the problem without fuelling the far right, perhaps mindful that Oldham had already been torn apart by racial division during the 2001 riots. \u201cSexual exploitation is a real issue, and we need to be addressing it,\u201d a 2011 memo from Greater Manchester police read. \u201cPeople feel strongly about this issue and there is the potential for it to escalate. There is the perception that there is a conspiracy of silence due to political correctness and that some areas are not dealing with the issue.\u201d Police said in the same document that there was a \u201cneed to continue to provide support to the Messenger team\u201d but warned: \u201cFurther cases in Oldham might bring wider media interest and further exploitation of the issue by the BNP and English Defence League. There is therefore a risk of further demonstrations and the risk of increased hate crimes.\u201d It added that Muslim communities felt \u201cdemonised\u201d. One victim referred to in Operation Messenger, Samantha Walker-Roberts, has expressed concern about her story being hijacked by far-right groups. She was 12 when she was kidnapped from a police station in October 2006, as she tried to report a sexual assault by a man in a nearby churchyard. She was then trafficked around the town to be abused by multiple men. She ended the night in a quiet cul-de-sac, at the home of Shakil Chowdhury, where she remembers being raped for hours by five men. Only Chowdhury was convicted and vital forensic evidence that could have helped trace outstanding suspects was destroyed or returned to him via his solicitor. During his trial, Chowdhury named two accomplices, but police did not follow up this information, according to the 2022 safeguarding review. The men remained at large and, in 2009, one tried to murder his wife. In 2011, this man\u2019s wife told police he had confessed to raping a 12-year-old and had even kept newspaper clippings about Chowdhury\u2019s trial. Again, the Messenger team did not act. Greater Manchester police said in a statement that the treatment Walker-Roberts received was \u201cfar from the standard survivors can expect\u201d from the force today and added that it was pursuing \u201clong and complex investigations\u201d into historical child sexual exploitation, which include Walker-Roberts\u2019 case. Walker-Roberts, now 32, has campaigned for an independent inquiry in Oldham for more than five years and hopes it will help establish whether Chowdhury, a British citizen born in Bangladesh, and his accomplices could have been stopped before they attacked her. Many years after her ordeal she tracked down some of his former neighbours; she later told the council and the safeguarding review that they recalled a \u201cconveyor belt\u201d of children arriving at Chowdhury\u2019s house in taxis.

ITV launched its AdVentures Invest programme in 2021 to enable the broadcaster to take minority stakes in early stage digital and direct-to-consumer businesses, alongside venture capital investment, in return for advertising across ITV\u2019s channels. This is aimed at helping consumer businesses to build scale through TV advertising. The broadcaster has previously invested in the online estate agent Strike, which trades as Purplebricks, the furniture price comparison website ufurnish.com and the location app what3words.",

But NHS England said hospitals remained under \u201cincredible\u201d pressure, with 95% of beds full. The cold weather was likely to escalate the situation, it said.\nOn Wednesday, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued amber warnings for every region of England, which will be in place between 8pm on Wednesday until 10am next Tuesday.\nPreviously, only north-east and north-west England were under an amber alert, with all other regions under a yellow alert. Amber cold health alerts are issued when the forecast weather is \u201clikely to cause significant impacts across health and social care services\u201d.\nDr Paul Coleman, a health protection consultant at the UKHSA, said it was likely to be \u201cvery cold\u201d across England over the next few days. \u201cLow temperatures like these can have serious impacts on the health of some people, particularly older people and those with serious health conditions.\n\u201cExposure to cold can lead to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections. It is therefore really important, as the colder weather sets in, to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.\u201d\nWednesday\u2019s NHS figures showed an average of 117 patients with flu were in critical care beds in the week ending 21 December, down from 128 the previous week. Separately, an average of 285 hospital beds were filled each day in the week ending 21 December by patients with diarrhoea and vomiting or norovirus-like symptoms, down from 427 the previous week.\nProf Meghana Pandit, NHS England\u2019s medical director, said the health service remained \u201cunder extraordinary pressure\u201d, adding: \u201cWhile there are signs of improvement and the NHS is in calmer waters, pressures on hospitals remain incredibly high and we\u2019re not out of danger yet with temperatures set to drop in the coming days.\u201d\nWes Streeting, the health secretary, praised NHS staff for their efforts but said hospitals were \u201cnot out of the woods yet, with flu continuing to be a challenge\u201d.\nRory Deighton, an acute and community care director at the NHS Confederation, added: \u201cServices are still seeing high levels of demand due to seasonal viruses and bed occupancy is around 95%, which is well above safe levels.

The trend of patients heading to emergency departments with non-emergency symptoms is underlined by the fact that doctors found nothing wrong with more than 2 million A&E patients in 2024-25.\nIt comes as Wes Streeting, the health secretary, faces pressure to show he is making progress after a year and a half in charge of the NHS. Last month Prof Kamila Hawthorne, Britain\u2019s most senior GP, told the Guardian that surgeries wanted to hire more doctors to meet demand for primary care but could not afford to do so because of a lack of core funding.\nAs people continue to be urged to stay at home over the new year period if they have symptoms of flu or Covid, analysis of NHS data by the PA Media news agency found more patients were turning to A&E for minor conditions.\nIn the last five years, doctors saw almost 1.9m cases of people seeking help for a headache. Almost 1.4m A&E attendances in England from 2020-21 to 2024-25 were for a cough and 1.2m were for a sore throat.\nOne million A&E attendances were due to earache, according to the analysis. There were almost 69,000 A&E attendances for a blocked nose, 4,200 for hiccups and 290,000 cases of constipation.\nThe figures show how A&E attendances for some medical emergencies have stayed relatively consistent during and since the pandemic. For instance, 10,293 attendances owing to cardiac arrest were recorded in 2020-21, compared with 10,744 in 2024-25. The number of people diagnosed in A&E with a broken hip was 43,646 in 2020-21 and 43,326 in 2024-25.\nAt the same time, there has been a notable increase in attendances for minor ailments. About 44,000 cases of \u201ccough\u201d were dealt with in 2020-21 and the number has risen every year to reach 435,728 in 2024-25 \u2013 a near tenfold increase.\nThere were 59,120 A&E attendances where the chief complaint was diarrhoea in 2020-21, rising each year to reach 143,591 by 2024-25. Cases of constipation grew from 40,962 to 70,933, backache from 211,266 to 396,724, nausea from 9,795 to 20,516, and hiccups from 587 to 1,093.\nDoctors recorded \u201cno abnormality was detected\u201d for 2.2m A&E attendances in 2024-25, while more than half a million patients walked out before a first diagnosis was made, the figures show.\nThe government\u2019s 10-year plan for the health service has vowed to shift care away from hospitals, creating a \u201cneighbourhood health service\u201d in towns and cities across the country.\nBut Daniel Elkeles, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said the shift needed to happen much more quickly. \u201cPatients choosing to attend A&E for help with relatively simple conditions like earache lays bare a failure to give people enough access to convenient, responsive services closer to home where they can get the help they need there and then,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOur new year\u2019s wish would be to see neighbourhood healthcare \u2018turbocharged\u2019 to create many more primary care appointments, in communities and GP practices, to boost patients\u2019 satisfaction with the NHS and ease pressure on busy A&Es.\u201d\nDr Ian Higginson, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: \u201cThis is a symptom of the healthcare system not working as it was designed to. Just like our EDs [emergency departments], our colleagues in primary and community services are at capacity when their services are open, but those services often aren\u2019t open when patients need them.\u201d\nThe National Pharmacy Association chief executive, Henry Gregg, said people were spending hours in A&E with issues that could instead be treated in a community pharmacy.\n\u201cPharmacists are highly trained healthcare professionals and can now supply prescription medicines on the NHS without the need for a GP appointment, for a range of common illnesses,\u201d he said.\nNHS England said staff were working hard to expand the number of routes into the health service so patients could get fast and convenient care closer to them. It urged people to use alternatives to A&E to get help in the most appropriate place, including services online, via phone or in person.\nA spokesperson added: \u201cAs always, the public should use A&E and 999 for life-threatening conditions and serious injuries \u2013 and for non-life-threatening care, call NHS 111 or use 111 online, which can direct you to the most appropriate place \u2013 whether that be your local pharmacy, a walk-in centre or clinical self-help advice.\u201d\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said there was a \u201clong road ahead\u201d to fix the NHS, but said it was \u201calready delivering change\u201d by shifting care out of hospitals and into communities.

    "content": "Britain\u2019s media regulator Ofcom is under pressure to investigate a GB News interview with Donald Trump after complaints that it contained misleading and inaccurate claims that the network failed to challenge.\nThe rightwing channel claimed a \u201cworld exclusive sit-down interview\u201d with the US president in November, in which Trump asserted that human-induced climate change was \u201ca hoax\u201d and that London had no-go areas for police and that the capital had \u201csharia law\u201d.\nTrump made other claims about law and order and immigration that critics said were either left unchallenged or effectively endorsed by the GB News interviewer Bev Turner, the host of its US-based nightly show.\nAmong those calling for an investigation is Chris Banatvala, Ofcom\u2019s founding director of standards. He told the Guardian he had \u201cnever seen anything comparable on a UK-established domestic broadcaster\u201d.\nOfcom officials have spent the last few weeks examining at least three detailed complaints co-signed by tens of thousands of people, but have not yet decided whether to launch a formal investigation. The regulator is facing increasing accusations that it is reluctant to intervene over politically difficult issues of impartiality.\nThe complaints point to rules stating broadcasters must not \u201cmaterially mislead the audience\u201d and rules around due impartiality.\nA complaint from Bob Ward, from the LSE\u2019s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, focused on Trump\u2019s claims about human-induced climate change. Trump stated: \u201cThe whole thing is a hoax \u2026 but your country is one of the worst.\u201d\nTrump also made disputed claims about the red tape and taxes related to drilling in the North Sea, as well as stating that wind power was \u201cthe most expensive energy you can get\u201d. This is contradicted by recent research.\nWard said: \u201cThe GB News interview with President Trump was the most blatant example of a British media organisation collaborating with the Trump administration to undermine British democracy with this misinformation.\u201d\nComplaints have also been made about Trump\u2019s claim that London has areas \u201cwhere the police don\u2019t even want to go\u201d and that \u201cyou have sharia law where they don\u2019t even want to obey the laws of \u2026 your country\u201d.\nThere was no challenge from the comments from Turner. When Trump said people are \u201cbeing stabbed in the ass or worse\u201d, she stated: \u201cIt\u2019s true \u2026 It\u2019s awful, it is. And it feels much safer [in the US].\u201d\nA complaint over a lack of impartiality from the 38 Degrees campaign group pointed to Turner \u201cpraising and endorsing Trump multiple times\u201d. During the interview, she described a speech by Trump as \u201cone of the greatest moments at the UN\u201d and that she \u201cloved it, it was brilliant\u201d.\nGB News declined to comment on the complaints.\nGB News is emerging as a regular platform for Trump administration figures to raise chosen talking points. Trump\u2019s White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has repeatedly promoted the broadcaster.\nBanatvala, who was Ofcom\u2019s founding director of standards, said the regulator was under \u201cintense pressure to act\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cThis case poses a real challenge for the regulator \u2013 not least because of the considerable leeway it has already given GB News and because it involves an interview with a sitting US president.\n\u201cWhile this style of interview \u2013 with no challenge and a presenter effectively feeding lines \u2013 may be the norm for Newsmax and Fox News, I\u2019ve never seen anything comparable on a UK-established domestic broadcaster. There is no doubt this programme warrants investigation for potential breaches of the due impartiality and misleading rules.\n\u201cIf Ofcom chooses not to investigate, it would effectively signal that the regulator has abandoned impartiality and broadcasters no longer need to comply with these rules.\u201d\nAn Ofcom spokesperson said: \u201cWe are assessing the complaints against our rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.\u201d",

The rightwing channel claimed a \u201cworld exclusive sit-down interview\u201d with the US president in November, in which Trump asserted that human-induced climate change was \u201ca hoax\u201d and that London had no-go areas for police and that the capital had \u201csharia law\u201d. Trump made other claims about law and order and immigration that critics said were either left unchallenged or effectively endorsed by the GB News interviewer Bev Turner, the host of its US-based nightly show. Among those calling for an investigation is Chris Banatvala, Ofcom\u2019s founding director of standards. He told the Guardian he had \u201cnever seen anything comparable on a UK-established domestic broadcaster\u201d. Ofcom officials have spent the last few weeks examining at least three detailed complaints co-signed by tens of thousands of people, but have not yet decided whether to launch a formal investigation. The regulator is facing increasing accusations that it is reluctant to intervene over politically difficult issues of impartiality. The complaints point to rules stating broadcasters must not \u201cmaterially mislead the audience\u201d and rules around due impartiality. A complaint from Bob Ward, from the LSE\u2019s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, focused on Trump\u2019s claims about human-induced climate change. Trump stated: \u201cThe whole thing is a hoax \u2026 but your country is one of the worst.\u201d Trump also made disputed claims about the red tape and taxes related to drilling in the North Sea, as well as stating that wind power was \u201cthe most expensive energy you can get\u201d. This is contradicted by recent research. Ward said: \u201cThe GB News interview with President Trump was the most blatant example of a British media organisation collaborating with the Trump administration to undermine British democracy with this misinformation.\u201d Complaints have also been made about Trump\u2019s claim that London has areas \u201cwhere the police don\u2019t even want to go\u201d and that \u201cyou have sharia law where they don\u2019t even want to obey the laws of \u2026 your country\u201d. There was no challenge from the comments from Turner. When Trump said people are \u201cbeing stabbed in the ass or worse\u201d, she stated: \u201cIt\u2019s true \u2026 It\u2019s awful, it is. And it feels much safer [in the US].\u201d A complaint over a lack of impartiality from the 38 Degrees campaign group pointed to Turner \u201cpraising and endorsing Trump multiple times\u201d. During the interview, she described a speech by Trump as \u201cone of the greatest moments at the UN\u201d and that she \u201cloved it, it was brilliant\u201d. GB News declined to comment on the complaints. GB News is emerging as a regular platform for Trump administration figures to raise chosen talking points. Trump\u2019s White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has repeatedly promoted the broadcaster. Banatvala, who was Ofcom\u2019s founding director of standards, said the regulator was under \u201cintense pressure to act\u201d. He said: \u201cThis case poses a real challenge for the regulator \u2013 not least because of the considerable leeway it has already given GB News and because it involves an interview with a sitting US president. \u201cWhile this style of interview \u2013 with no challenge and a presenter effectively feeding lines \u2013 may be the norm for Newsmax and Fox News, I\u2019ve never seen anything comparable on a UK-established domestic broadcaster. There is no doubt this programme warrants investigation for potential breaches of the due impartiality and misleading rules. \u201cIf Ofcom chooses not to investigate, it would effectively signal that the regulator has abandoned impartiality and broadcasters no longer need to comply with these rules.\u201d An Ofcom spokesperson said: \u201cWe are assessing the complaints against our rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.\u201d",

    "content": "A US appeals court agreed on Tuesday to allow the Trump administration to strip Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood health centers in 22 states and Washington DC.\nThe order from the three-judge panel of the Boston-based first US circuit court of appeals puts on hold an injunction issued by US district judge Indira Talwani. Talwani\u2019s injunction had blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a provision of its massive tax-and-spending bill that blocks Planned Parenthood from receiving reimbursements from Medicaid, the US government\u2019s health insurance program for low-income people, in the 22 states.\nThe panel\u2019s decision is only the latest legal volley in the months-long war over the Trump administration\u2019s provision. The appeals court previously lifted another order by Talwani in a separate case, brought by Planned Parenthood, that had also blocked the measure\u2019s enforcement.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, called the Tuesday ruling disappointing but said he remained committed to \u201censuring vulnerable Californians can access the healthcare they need\u201d. Bonta, a Democrat, co-led the case with his counterparts from Connecticut and New York.\nPlanned Parenthood did not respond to a request for comment.\nRepublicans in Congress passed the provision as part of their One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Specifically, it bars Medicaid funding for tax-exempt organizations that provide family planning and reproductive health services if they perform abortions and received more than $800,000 in Medicaid funds during the 2023 fiscal year.\nPlanned Parenthood says the provision was passed with it in mind and has contributed to at least 20 of its health centers closing since Trump signed the measure into law in July. The reproductive healthcare giant has warned that the measure could ultimately lead up to 200 health centers to close. Because most of those centers are located in blue states that still permit abortion, their closure could dramatically curtail access to the procedure. The measure, advocates have said, amounts to a \u201cback-door abortion ban\u201d.\nIt is already broadly illegal to pay for abortions using federal dollars. Instead, Planned Parenthood uses Medicaid reimbursements to fund services such as STI tests, cancer screenings and the provision of contraception. In 2024, Planned Parenthood centers treated people who rely on Medicaid with more than 1.5m visits.\nIf those people can no longer go to Planned Parenthood for reproductive health services, experts say they will probably be left with nowhere to turn.\nAfter the first circuit earlier this year paused Talwani\u2019s initial injunction in Planned Parenthood\u2019s favor, a group of Democratic attorneys general asked her to block the law\u2019s enforcement again, but on different grounds.\nTalwani, who was appointed by Barack Obama, agreed to do so on 2 December, saying the states were likely to succeed in establishing that the law constitutes an unconstitutional retroactive condition on their participation in the Medicaid program.\nTalwani held that the law did not give the states clear notice as to which entities it covered and imposed a restriction they could not have anticipated after the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved their state Medicaid plans.\nBut on Tuesday, the first circuit panel \u2013 comprising only judges appointed by Democratic presidents \u2013 said the Trump administration had demonstrated it was likely to prevail on appeal in establishing the law was not ambiguous and that Congress had the power to make such changes.",

He is seeking to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive \u2013 a way for the Trump administration to punish him for the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.\nTo support that argument, he has asked the government to turn over documents that reveal how the decision was made to prosecute him in 2025 for an incident that occurred in 2022. On 3 December, US district judge Waverly Crenshaw filed an order under seal that compelled the government to provide some documents to \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda and his attorneys. That order was unsealed on Tuesday and sheds new light on the case.\nEarlier, Crenshaw found that there was \u201csome evidence\u201d that the prosecution of \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda could be vindictive. He specifically cited a statement by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda because he had won his wrongful deportation case.\nRob McGuire, who was the acting US attorney for the middle district of Tennessee until late December, argued that those statements were irrelevant because he alone made the decision to prosecute, and he has no animus against \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda.\nIn the newly unsealed order, Crenshaw writes: \u201cSome of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in [the justice department] and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision.\u201d\nThe US attorney\u2019s office for the middle district of Tennessee released a statement saying: \u201cThe emails cited in Judge Crenshaw\u2019s order, specifically Mr McGuire\u2019s email on May 15, 2025, confirm that the ultimate decision on whether to prosecute was made by career prosecutors based on the facts, evidence, and established [justice department] practice. Communications with the Deputy Attorney General\u2019s Office about a high-profile case are both required and routine.\u201d\nThe email referenced was from McGuire to his staff stating that Blanche \u201cwould like Garcia charged sooner rather than later\u201d, according to Crenshaw\u2019s order.\nThe human-smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee during which \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was pulled over for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and state troopers discussed the possibility of human smuggling among themselves. However, he was ultimately allowed to leave with only a warning. The case was turned over to Homeland Security Investigations, but there is no record of any effort to charge him until April 2025, according to court records.\nThe order does not give much detail on what is in the documents that were turned over to \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, but it shows that Aakash Singh, who works under Blanche in the office of the deputy attorney general, contacted McGuire about \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda\u2019s case on 27 April, the same day that McGuire received a file on the case from Homeland Security Investigations. That was several days after the US supreme court ruled in \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda\u2019s favor on 10 April.\nOn 30 April, Singh said in an email to McGuire that the prosecution was a \u201ctop priority\u201d for the deputy attorney general\u2019s office, according to the order.

On 18 May, Singh wrote to McGuire and others to hold the draft indictment until they got \u201cclearance\u201d to file it. \u201cThe implication is that \u2018clearance\u2019 would come from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,\u201d Crenshaw writes.\nA hearing on the motion to dismiss the case on the basis of vindictive prosecution is scheduled for 28 January.",

    "content": "On a cold Saturday morning, a little over a week before the New York City mayoral election in November, I was at a park in Queens to speak at a fundraiser for Asiyah Women\u2019s Centre, the oldest and largest shelter providing support for American Muslim female victims of domestic violence. Vendors selling everything from chai to embroidered Palestinian handicrafts turned out to support the fundraiser; a DJ blasted music and artists painted children\u2019s faces with the colours of Halloween.\nI chose the vendor with the most protein on offer because I lift and squat more than my bodyweight and must meet a daily goal. \u201cOur kebab is one of Zohran\u2019s favourites,\u201d the man at the King of Kebab stand told me, proudly and unprompted, as he piled my plate with meat.\nI had not asked him anything about the mayoral race but I knew exactly who he meant, because like Cher, Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9 and Bj\u00f6rk, our mayor-elect is simply Zohran to many of us. And not because we can\u2019t pronounce his family name \u2013 I\u2019m looking at you Andrew Cuomo and all who seem to deliberately mangle \u201cMamdani\u201d. In New York City, and everywhere else I\u2019ve been, 2025 was the year when everybody learned his name. And after he is sworn in today on the steps of City Hall \u2013 followed by a party for 40,000 in Lower Manhattan \u2013 2026 will be the year of Zohran.\nI\u2019ve been a New Yorker for 23 years. During that time, I have travelled across the world to give lectures and I\u2019ve never been asked what I think of Michael (Bloomberg), Bill (de Blasio), or Eric (Adams) \u2013 our mayors since I moved here. None of them has come close to encapsulating the arduous and necessary complication of identity that many New Yorkers feel in this city of a million Muslims. But ever since he announced his mayoral candidacy at the end of 2024, Zohran has seemed to represent something that my life has bumped up against many times since I have lived here.\nI\u2019ve spent 19 of my 23 years in NYC in Harlem, where I live in a rent-stabilised apartment in a brownstone owned by a Black woman from the neighbourhood. Mamdani campaigned as an ally to tenants like me, vowing to freeze rent for 2 million people living in rent-stabilised apartments as part of his focus on affordability. A few weeks before we went to the polls, my landlady and I were catching up in the hall outside her apartment. \u201cI hope you\u2019re voting for Zohran,\u201d she said.\nDuring my citizenship oath in NYC in 2011, we were told that in the hall for the ceremony were people from 140 countries about to become US citizens. Few other cities hold the allure of New York in the global imagination. And few other Muslims have reached Mamdani\u2019s level of first-name celebrity status, or the ability to complicate the narrative of what a Muslim is. I am an avowed consumer of cannabis and I cheered Mamdani\u2019s response during the mayoral debates when candidates were asked if they had ever bought marijuana, which is legal in New York. \u201cI\u2019ve purchased marijuana at a legal cannabis shop,\u201d Mamdani replied, with a big cheesy grin. Fuck, yeah, Zohran!\nI moved from Egypt to Seattle in 2000, and then to New York City a year after the September 11 attacks. Soon after arriving, I found community with Muslims and we began to call ourselves progressive Muslims. Unlike me, most of them had been born and raised in the US. Those who did not wear hijabs spoke often of how the 9/11 attacks forced an unfamiliar visibility upon Muslims, who comprise less than 2% of the US population. That was especially the case for those whose families were more recent arrivals, compared to Black Muslims who have been in the country as far back as the days of enslavement. \u201cI came out as Muslim after 9/11,\u201d one of my new friends told me at the time, adding that his neighbours and colleagues had assumed he was Latinx. Over the years since, I have lost count of the number of \u201cNo hablo espa\u00f1ol,\u201d that I\u2019ve issued across the city because I\u2019m often thought to be Dominican or Puerto Rican.\nMamdani lives in Queens, the site of the fundraiser for the Asiyah Women\u2019s Centre. \u201cThe capital of linguistic diversity, not just for the five boroughs (of New York City), but for the human species, is Queens,\u201d Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-Schapiro wrote in Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas.

    "content_clean": "On a cold Saturday morning, a little over a week before the New York City mayoral election in November, I was at a park in Queens to speak at a fundraiser for Asiyah Women\u2019s Centre, the oldest and largest shelter providing support for American Muslim female victims of domestic violence. Vendors selling everything from chai to embroidered Palestinian handicrafts turned out to support the fundraiser; a DJ blasted music and artists painted children\u2019s faces with the colours of Halloween. I chose the vendor with the most protein on offer because I lift and squat more than my bodyweight and must meet a daily goal. \u201cOur kebab is one of Zohran\u2019s favourites,\u201d the man at the King of Kebab stand told me, proudly and unprompted, as he piled my plate with meat. I had not asked him anything about the mayoral race but I knew exactly who he meant, because like Cher, Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9 and Bj\u00f6rk, our mayor-elect is simply Zohran to many of us. And not because we can\u2019t pronounce his family name \u2013 I\u2019m looking at you Andrew Cuomo and all who seem to deliberately mangle \u201cMamdani\u201d. In New York City, and everywhere else I\u2019ve been, 2025 was the year when everybody learned his name. And after he is sworn in today on the steps of City Hall \u2013 followed by a party for 40,000 in Lower Manhattan \u2013 2026 will be the year of Zohran. I\u2019ve been a New Yorker for 23 years. During that time, I have travelled across the world to give lectures and I\u2019ve never been asked what I think of Michael (Bloomberg), Bill (de Blasio), or Eric (Adams) \u2013 our mayors since I moved here. None of them has come close to encapsulating the arduous and necessary complication of identity that many New Yorkers feel in this city of a million Muslims. But ever since he announced his mayoral candidacy at the end of 2024, Zohran has seemed to represent something that my life has bumped up against many times since I have lived here. I\u2019ve spent 19 of my 23 years in NYC in Harlem, where I live in a rent-stabilised apartment in a brownstone owned by a Black woman from the neighbourhood. Mamdani campaigned as an ally to tenants like me, vowing to freeze rent for 2 million people living in rent-stabilised apartments as part of his focus on affordability. A few weeks before we went to the polls, my landlady and I were catching up in the hall outside her apartment. \u201cI hope you\u2019re voting for Zohran,\u201d she said. During my citizenship oath in NYC in 2011, we were told that in the hall for the ceremony were people from 140 countries about to become US citizens. Few other cities hold the allure of New York in the global imagination. And few other Muslims have reached Mamdani\u2019s level of first-name celebrity status, or the ability to complicate the narrative of what a Muslim is. I am an avowed consumer of cannabis and I cheered Mamdani\u2019s response during the mayoral debates when candidates were asked if they had ever bought marijuana, which is legal in New York. \u201cI\u2019ve purchased marijuana at a legal cannabis shop,\u201d Mamdani replied, with a big cheesy grin. Fuck, yeah, Zohran! I moved from Egypt to Seattle in 2000, and then to New York City a year after the September 11 attacks. Soon after arriving, I found community with Muslims and we began to call ourselves progressive Muslims. Unlike me, most of them had been born and raised in the US. Those who did not wear hijabs spoke often of how the 9/11 attacks forced an unfamiliar visibility upon Muslims, who comprise less than 2% of the US population. That was especially the case for those whose families were more recent arrivals, compared to Black Muslims who have been in the country as far back as the days of enslavement. \u201cI came out as Muslim after 9/11,\u201d one of my new friends told me at the time, adding that his neighbours and colleagues had assumed he was Latinx. Over the years since, I have lost count of the number of \u201cNo hablo espa\u00f1ol,\u201d that I\u2019ve issued across the city because I\u2019m often thought to be Dominican or Puerto Rican. Mamdani lives in Queens, the site of the fundraiser for the Asiyah Women\u2019s Centre. \u201cThe capital of linguistic diversity, not just for the five boroughs (of New York City), but for the human species, is Queens,\u201d Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-Schapiro wrote in Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas. There are as many as 800 languages spoken in New York City, and nowhere in the world has more than Queens, according to the Endangered Language Alliance.

    "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s new national security strategy offers a misguided assessment of Europe, long regarded as the US\u2019s most reliable ally. Unrestrained immigration and other policies derided by administration officials as \u201cwoke\u201d, it warns, could lead to \u201ccivilisational erasure\u201d within a few decades.\nThat argument rests on a fundamental misreading of Europe\u2019s current predicament. While the EU does face an existential threat, it has little to do with immigration or cultural politics. In fact, the share of foreign-born residents in the US is slightly higher than in Europe.\nThe real threat facing Europe lies in its own economic and technological backwardness. Between 2008 and 2023, GDP rose by 87% in the US, compared with just 13.5% in the EU. Over the same period, the EU\u2019s GDP per capita fell from 76.5% of the US level to 50%. Even the poorest US state \u2013 Mississippi \u2013 has a higher per capita income than that of several major European economies, including France, Italy and the EU average.\nThis widening economic gap cannot be explained by demographics. Instead, it reflects stronger productivity growth in the US, largely owing to technological innovation and higher total factor productivity. Today, roughly half of the world\u2019s 50 largest technology firms are American, while only four are European. Over the past five decades, 241 US firms have grown from startups into companies with market capitalisations of at least $10bn (\u00a37.4bn), compared with just 14 in Europe.\nThese trends raise a critical question: which countries will lead the industries of the future, and where does Europe fit in? The race for technological leadership now spans a wide range of fields, including AI and machine learning, semiconductor design and production, robotics, quantum computing, fusion energy, fintech and defence technologies. Europe enters this race at a clear disadvantage.\nWhether the US or China currently leads the industries of the future remains open to debate, but most observers agree that it\u2019s essentially a two-horse race, with the US still ahead in several key areas. Beyond that, innovation is concentrated in countries such as Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, India and Israel. In Europe, by contrast, innovative activities are largely confined to the UK, Germany, France and Switzerland \u2013 two of which are not even EU member states.\nIt is hardly a surprise, then, that while the US and China dominate global technological rankings, Europe finds itself far from the top. And the outlook is anything but reassuring, given that the next wave of innovation is widely expected to be more disruptive than anything we have seen over the past half century.\nThe technological gap between the US and Europe can be attributed to several factors. First, the US has a far deeper and more dynamic ecosystem for financing startups, while Europe still lacks a genuine capital markets union, limiting the scale and speed at which new firms can grow.\nSecond, Europe is hampered by excessive and fragmented regulation. A US startup can launch a product under a single regulatory framework and immediately access a market of more than 330 million consumers. The EU has a population of roughly 450 million but remains divided among 27 national regulatory regimes. An International Monetary Fund analysis shows that internal market barriers in the EU act like a tariff of about 44% for goods and 110% for services \u2013 far higher than the tariff levels the US imposes on most imports.\nThird, cultural attitudes toward risk-taking differ sharply. Until relatively recently, a failed entrepreneur in some EU countries (such as Italy) could face criminal penalties, while in the US, a tech founder who has never failed is often seen as too risk-averse.\nFourth, the US benefits from a deeply integrated academic-military-industrial complex, while Europe\u2019s chronic underinvestment in defence has weakened its innovation capacity. Technological leaders such as the US, China, Israel and, more recently, Ukraine spend heavily on defence, with military research often producing technologies that have civilian applications.\nDespite this, many European political leaders continue to frame higher defence spending as a trade-off between security and social welfare. In reality, free-riding on US defence spending since the end of the second world war has limited the type of innovation that could have generated more of both through higher productivity. Paradoxically, sustaining Europe\u2019s social model will require greater investment in defence, beginning with meeting Nato\u2019s new spending target of 3.5% of GDP.\nIf Europe allows its technological lag to grow over the coming decades, it risks prolonged stagnation and continued economic decline relative to the US and China. There are, however, reasons for cautious optimism. Increasingly aware that Europe faces an existential challenge, policymakers have begun to advance serious reform proposals. The most notable examples are the two major 2024 reports on EU competitiveness and the single market by the former Italian prime ministers Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta respectively.\nEurope also retains considerable strengths, including high-quality human capital, excellent education systems and world-class research institutions. With the right incentives and regulatory reforms, these assets could support much higher levels of commercial innovation. With a better environment for entrepreneurship, Europe\u2019s high per capita income, large internal market and elevated savings rates could help unleash a wave of investment.\nCrucially, even if Europe never leads in cutting-edge technologies, it could still significantly boost productivity by adopting and adapting American and Chinese innovations. Many of these technologies are general-purpose in character, benefiting both adopters and pioneers.\nAll of this leaves Europe at an inflection point. As Ernest Hemingway famously observed, bankruptcy happens \u201cgradually and then suddenly\u201d. So far, Europe\u2019s technological decline has been gradual. But if it fails to confront its structural weaknesses, today\u2019s slow erosion could give way to a sudden and irreversible loss of economic relevance.\nNouriel Roubini is professor emeritus at the Stern school of business and the author of Megathreats: Ten Dangerous Trends that Imperil Our Future and How to Survive Them.",

Nouriel Roubini is professor emeritus at the Stern school of business and the author of Megathreats: Ten Dangerous Trends that Imperil Our Future and How to Survive Them.",

Labubus seemed to be the only ones smiling through 2025. Maybe they know 2026 is going to be worse.\nSydney Sweeney sparked a good old-fashioned internet outrage cycle over an ad for American Eagle jeans that was only offensive if you were hoping to be offended. A pun about \u201cgenes\u201d and \u201cjeans\u201d only seems like a nod to eugenics if you specifically cast an attractive blonde lady for the ad. If I had been the spokesperson, people would have had a hearty laugh over it. \u201cGood genes? He can barely fit into his pants!\u201d Honestly, I chuckled at the ad anyway. Mostly because someone actually thought it was a good idea.\nSpeaking of internet outrage, Andy Byron, a tech CEO, and his head of human resources, Kristin Cabot, were caught on the kiss cam at a Coldplay concert. Cabot has subsequently gone on a press tour to convince maniacs to stop threatening her life. She claims her and Byron had not been engaged in an affair prior to the explosion of #coldplaygate. I, for one, believe her. I\u2019m constantly finding myself being held tenderly by my colleagues while Chris Martin warbles \u201cAdventure of a Lifetime.\u201d\nEveryone was eating Dubai chocolate, an expensive candy bar filled with pistachio cream so brightly green that it looks like it was injected with actual money. I didn\u2019t buy one because I\u2019m still saving my money for a Labubu.\nYou know who can afford all the expensive chocolate and nightmare dolls they want? The thieves who robbed the Louvre of $102m worth of jewels.

    "content": "American cross-country skiing reached a milestone on Wednesday when, for the first time, an American man and an American woman won World Cup races on the same day.\nGus Schumacher and Jessie Diggins delivered the historic double at stage three of the Tour de Ski in Toblach, Italy, both prevailing in a newly introduced 5km heat mass start free event that rewarded speed, pacing and collective tactics rather than head-to-head positioning.\nSchumacher set the tone in the men\u2019s race, skating aggressively from the outset in a format that split the field into staggered heats, with final placings determined by time. The 25-year-old crossed the line in 9:35.4 to secure only the second World Cup victory of his career, edging Austria\u2019s Benjamin Moser by two-tenths of a second. Norway\u2019s Lars Heggen finished a further four-tenths back in third.\nThe win lifted Schumacher to sixth overall in the Tour de Ski standings and capped a breakthrough performance in a discipline rarely contested on the World Cup circuit in recent years.\nLater in the day, Diggins matched the achievement on the women\u2019s side, adding another chapter in the final season of an already decorated career. The American claimed her 31st World Cup victory in a race that unfolded less as a traditional mass start than a test of shared tempo and efficiency, with athletes rotating the lead to sustain maximum speed.\nDiggins finished well clear of Sweden\u2019s Emma Ribom and Moa Ilar, who completed the podium, and extended her lead at the top of both the World Cup and Tour de Ski overall standings.\nBeyond the results, the day carried symbolic weight for a US team that has steadily closed the gap on traditional European powers. Julia Kern finished 10th in the women\u2019s race for her first top-10 result of the season, while Schumacher\u2019s win underscored a growing American presence on the men\u2019s side.\nThe Tour de Ski continues on Thursday with the 20km pursuit races, where athletes will start according to their accumulated time deficits, chasing overall points as the series moves into the new year.",

He could make his debut Saturday in Baylor\u2019s Big 12 opener at TCU.\nNnaji was the first pick of the second round, 31st overall, by the Detroit Pistons two and a half years ago. His draft rights have since been traded to Boston, then Charlotte and most recently the New York Knicks in October 2024. The 21-year-old Nnaji, who was playing in Europe before he was drafted, hasn\u2019t been on an NBA roster. He was 18 when he was drafted.\nInternational players with varying backgrounds, including professional leagues, have played college basketball for years. With players now getting paid under name, image and likeness (NIL) deals, college teams have added players from the NBA\u2019s developmental G League.\nThe NCAA said players wouldn\u2019t be eligible if they signed regular NBA contracts or two-way deals that involve G League affiliates. But the association said that won\u2019t necessarily apply to G League players without NBA deals, or other professional leagues in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\u201cAs schools are increasingly recruiting individuals with international league experience, the NCAA is exercising discretion in applying the actual and necessary expenses bylaw to ensure that prospective student-athletes with experience in American basketball leagues are not at a disadvantage compared to their international counterparts,\u201d NCAA president Charlie Baker said in a statement released by the association. \u201cRules have long permitted schools to enroll and play individuals with no prior collegiate experience midyear.\u201d\nArkansas coach John Calipari said he wasn\u2019t criticizing Baylor\u2019s Scott Drew or others trying to add players amid a shifting college landscape. But he said a rule should clearly disqualify any NBA draft pick.\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame coaches,\u201d Calipari said. \u201cLet me give you this, real simple ... If you put your name in the draft \u2013 I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re from Russia \u2013 and you stay in the draft, you can\u2019t play college basketball. Well, that\u2019s only for American kids. What? If your name is in that draft and you got drafted, you can\u2019t play, because that\u2019s our rule. But that\u2019s only for American kids. OK.\u201d\nDrew defended the move by pointing to other undrafted international players who are playing college basketball right now. Nastja Claessens, a 2024 third-round WNBA draft pick, is averaging 10.6 points in 11 games for the Kansas State women this season.\n\u201cUntil we get to collective bargaining, I don\u2019t think we can come up with rules that are agreeable or enforceable,\u201d Drew said. \u201cUntil that, I think all of us have got to be ready to adjust and adapt to what\u2019s out there. Early on, when it first came out with G League players, I wasn\u2019t in favor of that either. But again, we don\u2019t make the rules and as we find out about things, we\u2019re always going to adapt to put our program in the best position to be successful, because that\u2019s what we get paid to do.\u201d\nThe NCAA said court rulings in lawsuits challenging eligibility standards are making its rules difficult to enforce. Attorneys for Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, who is suing for more eligibility, latched on to Baylor\u2019s signing of Nnaji to try to bolster their argument.\n\u201cWhile the NCAA has prevailed on the vast majority of eligibility-related lawsuits, recent outlier decisions enjoining the NCAA on a nationwide basis from enforcing rules that have been on the books for decades \u2013 without even having a trial \u2013 are wildly destabilizing,\u201d Baker said in the statement. \u201cI will be working with D-I leaders in the weeks ahead to protect college basketball from these misguided attempts to destroy this American institution.\u201d",

Now here was the US president, on a rare visit, examining the project for himself.\n\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s about $3.1bn. It went up a little bit \u2013 or a lot,\u201d Trump said, as Jerome Powell, the typically calm Fed chair, vigorously shook his head. \u201cSo the $2.7bn is now $3.1bn\u2013\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of that, Mr President,\u201d Powell quickly interjected, as Trump pulled out a paper from his suit pocket as evidence. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that from anybody at the Fed.\u201d\nThe remarkable public encounter in late July was described as a \u201ctussle\u201d, \u201cspar\u201d and \u201cfeud\u201d by news outlets and came to symbolize an extraordinary battle for control of the world\u2019s largest economy.\nNever before has a president been so publicly, and relentlessly, critical of the country\u2019s top monetary policymaker. For decades, successive administrations have allowed the Fed, as the institution tasked with steering the US economy, to function independently, without political interference. No longer.\nTrump, who later embarked upon a vast construction of his own, with the surprise demolition of the entire East Wing of the White House for a new ballroom, continues to threaten legal action over the Fed renovations, and direct seemingly unlimited anger toward Powell.\nFew believe this historic test of the central bank\u2019s independence has run its course. In fact, it is widely expected to intensify in the coming months.\n\u201cThe institution was built to withstand a moment like this,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist. \u201cSome of the battle lines were drawn, but we haven\u2019t seen this play all the way out.\u201d\n\u2018The president should at least have a say\u2019\nThe US economy has had a rollercoaster year. Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs and crackdown on immigration destabilized prices and the labor market \u2013 the two domains the Fed aims to protect, and balance, by setting interest rates. Higher interest rates can calm inflation, but also risk raising unemployment. Lowering rates can stimulate economic growth, but risk higher prices.\nAt the beginning of the year, it looked like the Fed had achieved a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d: inflation had fallen significantly from the 40-year high it scaled in 2022, during the feverish post-pandemic economy, but the labor market had remained broadly stable. Interest rates went from near zero to 5.25% to 5.5%.\nWall Street was nevertheless anxious for rates to come down. On the campaign trail, Trump had made clear that he would want a say over how things are run at the Fed, and repeatedly suggested that he would pressure the central bank to lower rates.\n\u201cI feel the president should at least have say in there. I feel that strongly,\u201d he said in August 2024. \u201cIn my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in my cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve, or the chairman.\u201d\n\u2018Too Late Powell\u2019\nOnce he retook office, Trump\u2019s laser focus on lowering rates only intensified. When his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcement in April caused stock markets to plummet, he raged against the Fed for not acting quick enough.\n\u201cIf I want him out, he\u2019ll be out of there real fast, believe me,\u201d Trump said of Powell in mid-April. Markets did not respond kindly to the threat, and Trump eventually said that Powell\u2019s job was safe.\nIt was the beginning, however, of what would be a long summer of presidential attacks against the Fed. Trump continued to blast \u201cToo Late Powell\u201d on social media, and attempted to draw the central bank\u2019s renovations into the spotlight.\nOnce it was clear those strategies weren\u2019t working, the White House changed course. In August, when Trump announced he would fire Lisa Cook, a Biden-appointed Fed governor and member of the rate-setting federal open market committee.\nBill Pulte, a close ally of Trump and head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates mortgages, alleged that Cook had committed mortgage fraud. She had purportedly listed two homes as her primary residence, which could get her a better mortgage rate.\nCook, whose term ends in 2038, has since sued the White House to keep her role. The case will ultimately be determined next year by the supreme court, which temporarily blocked Cook\u2019s firing. Her lawyers are arguing the president needs demonstrated \u201ccause\u201d to fire a Fed governor, and that the fraud allegations come from \u201ccherrypicking\u201d facts.\n\u2018No risk-free path\u2019\nWhile the highly anticipated decision on Trump\u2019s bid to fire Cook will have sweeping consequences for his campaign to exert great control over the Fed, he is also preparing to pick Powell\u2019s replacement as Fed chair.\nEarlier this year, the supreme court mentioned the Fed in a separate ruling in which it allowed Trump to fire two members of independent labor boards. In its decision, the court said: \u201cThe Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\u201d\nThe suggestion that the court views the Fed differently compared to other federal agencies provides some hope to allies of Cook, and proponents of central banking independence, but it\u2019s still unclear how the justices will ultimately rule.\nThe White House is \u201ctesting the defense\u201d, Sahm said. \u201cSome have held up, and some may not. It\u2019s a pressure campaign.\u201d\nBut the Fed has so far remained stoic in face of the White House\u2019s assaults, and Wall Street still appears confident in the Fed\u2019s policymaking \u2013 essential for the stability of markets.\n\u201cThe Fed is always a political lightning rod. When things go wrong, the Fed is the first to blame. They get a lot of criticism when things aren\u2019t going right, and they don\u2019t get a lot of praise when things are going well,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics.\nBut Trump\u2019s attacks have largely \u201cfallen on deaf ears\u201d, added Sweet. \u201cI don\u2019t think it had any influence on what they did this year with regards to monetary policy.\u201d\nIn the fall, the Fed started to lower rates, but Powell made it clear that the move was taken out of caution for risks in the labor market. \u201cThere is no risk-free path\u201d for the central bank, Powell said in both his October and December press conferences.\nCould tension pick up in the new year?\nRates are now sitting at a range of 3.5% to 3.75%, almost 2% lower than two years ago. While the White House has softened against the Fed in recent months, tension could pick up in the new year.\nTrump said that he wants to see interest rates go down to 1%, but new projections from Fed officials suggest that most of the 12 voting members in the rate-setting committee don\u2019t expect much change to rates in the next year.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now gotten to a place where the risks of [inflation and unemployment] are what we think are broadly, roughly, in balance,\u201d Powell said in December.\nStill adamant to lower rates, Trump has instead focused on picking a new chair to replace Powell, whose term as chair is up at the end of May 2026. In recent weeks, he appears to have narrowed his focus on \u201cTwo Kevins\u201d: Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who Trump says \u201cthinks you have to lower rates\u201d, and Kevin Hassett, current director of the National Economic Council and a staunch Trump loyalist.\nTrump said that the next Fed chair should listen to the president. \u201cTypically, that\u2019s not done any more,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cI don\u2019t think he should do exactly what we say, but certainly we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m a smart voice and should be listened to.\u2019\nEconomists are mixed on the impact a new Trump-appointed Fed chair can have on overall decision making. The chair is just one vote among 12 on rates, but a Fed chair is also the face of the Fed.

    "content": "Wall Street finished 2025 near record highs on Wednesday, as ballooning tech valuations and hopes of lower interest rates helped stock markets defy a year of economic uncertainty.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 rose 16.4% over the course of the year, closing at 6,845.50 on New Year\u2019s Eve in New York, as investors largely shrugged off geopolitical uncertainty and the frenzy around artificial intelligence continued.\nIt fell 0.7% during Wednesday\u2019s trading session. Other global indices had an even stronger year. In London, the FTSE 100 enjoyed its biggest annual gain since 2009, advancing 21.5%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 13.4% during 2025. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite rallied 20.5%.\nDonald Trump\u2019s aggressive plan to impose sweeping US tariffs on imports from across the world spooked investors in the spring but acute anxiety gave way to a stubborn cynicism around the so-called \u201cTaco\u201d trade: Trump Always Chickens Out.\nWhile the US president did roll back some tariffs in response to concerns over their impact on American consumers and businesses, tariffs have surged to the highest average effective rate since 1935.\nThe longest US government shutdown in history also shrouded the economic landscape in a further layer of fog, as inflation held firm, jobs growth stalled, and the Federal Reserve weighed highly-anticipated decisions on rates.\nBut the wider market was buoyed by a sustained rise in tech stocks, driven by enormous interest in the potential of AI.\nFears of an emerging bubble in tech valuations loom large. The entire Nasdaq has surged by more than 110% since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in November 2022, sparking a sharp increase in interest surrounding the possibilities presented by AI.\nAt the heart of the rally is Nvidia, the top chipmaker, which this summer became the first public company in history to scale a $4tn market value, amid a stratospheric increase in its stock price. It finished the year up 34.8%, with a valuation of $4.55tn.\nThe S&P 500 \u2013 dominated by tech stocks like Nvidia; Apple; Microsoft; Amazon; and Alphabet, owner of Google and YouTube \u2013 enjoyed its third consecutive positive year in 2025, albeit with its weakest growth of the three.\nAnalysts broadly expect more of the same in 2026, having issued relatively optimistic market forecasts for the year ahead.\nA further climb is likely to please the president. Despite his protests, Trump appears to monitor the market closely, and regularly cites strong rallies as evidence of a strong economy on his watch.\nBut many Americans remain apprehensive about the economic outlook.

    "content_clean": "Wall Street finished 2025 near record highs on Wednesday, as ballooning tech valuations and hopes of lower interest rates helped stock markets defy a year of economic uncertainty. The benchmark S&P 500 rose 16.4% over the course of the year, closing at 6,845.50 on New Year\u2019s Eve in New York, as investors largely shrugged off geopolitical uncertainty and the frenzy around artificial intelligence continued. It fell 0.7% during Wednesday\u2019s trading session. Other global indices had an even stronger year. In London, the FTSE 100 enjoyed its biggest annual gain since 2009, advancing 21.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 13.4% during 2025. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite rallied 20.5%. Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive plan to impose sweeping US tariffs on imports from across the world spooked investors in the spring but acute anxiety gave way to a stubborn cynicism around the so-called \u201cTaco\u201d trade: Trump Always Chickens Out. While the US president did roll back some tariffs in response to concerns over their impact on American consumers and businesses, tariffs have surged to the highest average effective rate since 1935. The longest US government shutdown in history also shrouded the economic landscape in a further layer of fog, as inflation held firm, jobs growth stalled, and the Federal Reserve weighed highly-anticipated decisions on rates. But the wider market was buoyed by a sustained rise in tech stocks, driven by enormous interest in the potential of AI. Fears of an emerging bubble in tech valuations loom large. The entire Nasdaq has surged by more than 110% since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in November 2022, sparking a sharp increase in interest surrounding the possibilities presented by AI. At the heart of the rally is Nvidia, the top chipmaker, which this summer became the first public company in history to scale a $4tn market value, amid a stratospheric increase in its stock price. It finished the year up 34.8%, with a valuation of $4.55tn. The S&P 500 \u2013 dominated by tech stocks like Nvidia; Apple; Microsoft; Amazon; and Alphabet, owner of Google and YouTube \u2013 enjoyed its third consecutive positive year in 2025, albeit with its weakest growth of the three. Analysts broadly expect more of the same in 2026, having issued relatively optimistic market forecasts for the year ahead. A further climb is likely to please the president. Despite his protests, Trump appears to monitor the market closely, and regularly cites strong rallies as evidence of a strong economy on his watch. But many Americans remain apprehensive about the economic outlook. Twice as many Americans believe their financial security is getting worse than better, according to a Harris poll for the Guardian. And the stock market rally has disproportionately benefited the wealthy, leading some economists to refer to a \u201cK-shaped economy\u201d that is deepening inequality and has left those without investment portfolios feeling left behind.",

The company\u2019s customer service team told the FT that the recent government shutdown had disrupted shipments.\nThe T1 smartphone, described by the company as \u201cproudly American\u201d, was initially promoted as a US-made rival to devices from Apple and Samsung. Almost all smartphones sold in the US are made overseas, primarily in China and South Korea but also increasingly in India and Vietnam.\nEtched with an American flag, the T1 was initially promised in August and the website still states it will be released \u201clater this year\u201d. Customers are required to pay a $100 payment to pre-order the device.\nThe T1 launch came shortly after Trump criticised Apple over its plans to move the production of iPhones destined for the US market from China to India.\nIt remains unclear who could manufacture the T1 handset, given the low levels of domestic smartphone production in the US.\nTrump Mobile also offers a phone contract costing $47.45 monthly, with the name of the service plan and the price referencing Trump\u2019s status as the 47th US president.\nThe company has also recently started selling secondhand smartphones from Apple and Samsung on its website, which it states come \u201cwithout the inflated price tag\u201d.\nHowever, a refurbished iPhone 15, which was launched in September 2023, costs $629 (\u00a3467) through Trump Mobile, whereas customers can buy a newer model, an iPhone 16 from 2024, directly from Apple for $699. A Samsung Galaxy S24 is being sold for $459, slightly lower than the $489 listed on Samsung\u2019s US website.\nThe phone venture is headed by Trump\u2019s sons Donald Jr and Eric, who took over the family company after their father transitioned to his second presidency.\nThe mobile service joins Trump-branded watches, footwear and Bibles as products capitalising on his political brand, while Trump\u2019s sons have indicated there will be more to come.\nThe Trump Organization has expanded from real estate into digital media and telecommunications. The venture will operate through licensing deals that generated more than $8m for the president in 2024, according to financial disclosures.\nThe move into phones also raises questions about conflicts of interest, as the president\u2019s family business operates in a sector that is heavily regulated by federal agencies over which Trump wields executive power.",

    "content": "The year of 2025 was dizzying for Elon Musk. The tech titan began the year holding court with Donald Trump in Washington DC. As the months ticked by, one public appearance after another baffled the US and the world. Musk appeared to give a Nazi salute at Trump\u2019s inauguration, staunchly championed a 19-year-old staffer nicknamed \u201cBig Balls,\u201d denied reports of being a drug addict while advising the president, and showed up at a White House press conference with a black eye \u2013 all in the first half of the year alone.\n\u201cElon\u2019s attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you\u2019re an incrementalist, you just won\u2019t get your rocket to the moon,\u201d Susie Wiles, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, told Vanity Fair in an expansive interview earlier this month. \u201cAnd so with that attitude, you\u2019re going to break some china.\u201d\nMusk saw huge, multibillion-dollar wins and equally large losses in business this year. In his dealings with federal agencies, he was able to secure new enormous government contracts and expand SpaceX\u2019s operations. With Tesla, he was approved for a pay package that could make him the world\u2019s first trillionaire even as the company\u2019s global sales plunged. At the same time, Musk and his businesses were the target of protests, lawsuits and an exodus of high-level executives. He ended the year with a fortune worth some $600bn.\nIn the background, his turbulent personal life continued to provide surprises. Rightwing influencer Ashley St Clair sued Musk in February for custody of their five-month-old baby, revealing that Musk had fathered a 13th publicly documented child, for a total of now 14 children. As Musk made regular attacks in posts on X against transgender people, his estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who is trans, was featured in New York magazine and modeled at New York fashion week. And the New York Times published a lengthy investigation into Musk\u2019s father, Errol Musk, who was accused of child sex abuse.\nThe relationship that dominated Musk\u2019s public life, however, was his friendship and falling out with Trump. On the day of his inauguration, Trump empowered Musk to gut government agencies, which the tech billionaire did with zeal and abandon. But by June, Musk and Trump had broken up. Their bromance burned hot and fast. On one of his final days as a special government employee, Musk lashed out at the president on his social media platform, X, saying: \u201cTime to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.\u201d The post has since been deleted.\nThough the drama surrounding Musk was frequently absurd and unpredictable, it was also consequential. This was a year when the richest person in the world obtained new levels of wealth and power that few in history have ever approached, one that demonstrated the depth of his global influence as he sought to advance his rightwing agenda and grow his tech empire.\nWhile Musk had stayed away from Washington DC after the Epstein post, the billionaire was invited back in November for a White House dinner in honor of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. By the end of the year, Trump and Musk seemed to have made amends. When asked by Fox Business this month if Musk was back in his circle of friends, Trump suggested the two could have a future together again.\n\u201cWell, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI mean, I like Elon a lot.\u201d\nMusk expressed more regret than the president over the course the year had taken. When his former aide Katie Miller asked whether he would lead the unofficial \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d (Doge) again, knowing what he knows now, he responded: \u201cInstead of doing Doge, I would have worked on my companies. And they wouldn\u2019t have been burning the cars.\u201d\nMusk goes to Washington\nAfter becoming a Republican mega-donor and campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Musk began the year on a high as he prepared to enter the administration as the de facto leader of Doge. He immediately set a tone of chaos and outrage that would persist for the length of his time in the White House.\nDuring Trump\u2019s internationally televised inauguration event in January, Musk issued what many people interpreted as back-to-back fascist-syle salutes as he concluded a speech. Rights groups condemned the gesture while Musk attempted to dismiss the criticism as \u201cdirty tricks\u201d from legacy media. The reaction was so intense and negative that some Tesla owners sold their cars in response to Musk\u2019s gestures.\nMusk spurred further condemnation from Jewish groups after appearing virtually at a rally for Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party. The Tesla CEO told the crowd via livestream that Germans should not focus on \u201cpast guilt\u201d and \u201cmove beyond that\u201d in an apparent reference to Nazi Germany.\nAs Musk started his work with Doge, the controversies and backlash against his politics grew. The newly formed bureau operated first as a loose collection of appointed staffers and then subsumed the US Digital Service. It rapidly moved to gut federal agencies and conduct mass layoffs across the government even as ethics watchdogs launched lawsuits accusing Musk\u2019s group of violating privacy and transparency laws, some of which continue today. Musk personally bragged about feeding the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the world\u2019s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, \u201cinto the woodchipper\u201d. The cuts would cause the abrupt cancellation of aid programs worldwide, disrupt HIV/Aids treatment for millions and result in children starving to death in a hunger crisis that experts agree was needless.\nAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk appeared to relish his new role as the Trump administration\u2019s demolition man. He brandished a chainsaw on stage and told the audience \u201cI am become meme!\u201d as he waved it about in sunglasses and a gold chain. In March, he once again began to pour more money into Republican causes by holding rallies and handing out $1m checks to support a conservative judge in Wisconsin\u2019s supreme court race.\nThe pushback against Musk\u2019s political blitz soon began to frustrate his ambitions, however. Judges that ruled Doge\u2019s activities illegal or issued temporary injunctions infuriated Musk, who called for the widespread impeachment of any \u201cactivist judges\u201d who opposed his agenda. His preferred candidate in the Wisconsin supreme court race lost by a significant margin, a sign to some in Washington that Musk\u2019s presence had potentially become politically toxic.\nMusk left his role in the White House in May amid disputes around his pick for who would head Nasa and clashes over Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Upon his exit, he signalled that his time with politics had come to a close, claiming he would reduce his campaign finance contributions in the future and return to his businesses. Yet he quickly put himself back in the spotlight with his public battle with Trump on social media and vowed he would start a third political party called the \u201cAmerica party,\u201d a promise that has yet to come to meaningful fruition.\nMusk\u2019s political leanings continued to drift rightward, allying himself via near-constant posts on X interacting with far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson and telling Joe Rogan that \u201cit should be OK to have white pride\u201d. He led an online grievance campaign in early October against the Anti-Defamation League, the country\u2019s most prominent Jewish advocacy group, claiming that it \u201chates Christians\u201d and suggesting that their documenting of extremism encouraged murder. Although no longer in the administration, his extreme conservative takes on immigration, race and politics have persisted as prominent features of his public identity.\nMusk\u2019s constellation of businesses\nThe year in Musk\u2019s businesses offered the billionaire even larger truckloads of money than before, despite facing intense controversy and competition.\nUnlike other tech moguls, who typically helm one company at a time, Musk sits astride several corporations. He controls the rocket company SpaceX and the tunneling and brain implant companies, Boring Inc and Neuralink, respectively. Musk also runs the social media company X, which he bought for a second time this year via his artificial intelligence company xAI. Then there\u2019s Tesla, his electric car company.\nOf all his enterprises, Tesla especially courted attention this year, as people enraged by Musk\u2019s work with Doge focused their attention on the carmaker\u2019s showrooms. Across the country, protesters marched at ongoing \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d events. One sign at a San Francisco protest in March read: \u201cBurn your swastikar before it burns you.\u201d Dozens of Tesla cars and charging stations nationwide were set on fire as one-off vandals protested the billionaire.\nThough Trump and Musk hosted what amounted to a Tesla sales event on the lawn of the White House in March, Tesla saw its sales slump worldwide.\nBy June, Musk had announced the rollout of its self-driving robotaxis in Austin. Within the first week, bystanders had recorded videos of the cars having difficulty turning left or picking which side of the road to drive on, which attracted the attention of regulators. These robotaxis, which were required to operate with a human safety driver up until earlier this month, have encountered only a handful of documented safety incidents since then.\nLawsuits against Tesla also piled up throughout the year. In August, a Florida jury awarded more than $200m to victims of a deadly crash involving its Autopilot technology in August. And in California, two separate lawsuits were filed in October over three teenagers who were killed when a Cybertruck caught on fire and locked them inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also opened several investigations into the carmaker over safety issues.\nWhile Tesla\u2019s plunge in profits continued throughout the year, that didn\u2019t stop the company\u2019s shareholders from approving a pay package for Musk \u2013 the largest corporate payout in history \u2013 that could catapult him to the status of the world\u2019s first trillionaire.\nTesla\u2019s year finished with a blow from California\u2019s department of motor vehicles. The agency said the car company had misled consumers and exaggerated the capabilities of its Autopilot technology. If Tesla doesn\u2019t \u201cremedy the situation\u201d within 90 days, the DMV said earlier in December, the company will be banned from selling cars in the state, its biggest US market.\nWith SpaceX, Musk was able to curry favor with the federal government. Not only did his Starlink satellites continue to dominate the Earth\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 the SpaceX subsidiary operates the vast majority of all satellites in orbit \u2013 but the Federal Aviation Administration and the air force gave SpaceX the go-ahead to increase rocket launches in Florida, Texas and California. This came despite the company\u2019s massive Starship, a 400ft machine that Musk hopes to one day fly to Mars, repeatedly blowing up and showering shrapnel across the Caribbean. One such explosion prompted legal action from Mexico, which said the debris harmed thousands of endangered sea turtle hatchlings.\nMusk also consolidated his social media and artificial intelligence companies this year. In March, he announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock transaction that he said valued X at $33bn. Both companies are privately held.\nxAI makes the Grok chatbot, which is integrated into X. The chatbot had countless meltdowns in the second year since its release. It pushed conspiracy theories about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d, claimed Trump won the 2020 election and spewed numerous antisemitic claims, once referring to itself as \u201cMechaHitler\u201d. Nevertheless, Musk was able to seal a $200m contract from the Department of Defense to integrate Grok into federal government tools.\nMeanwhile, Musk\u2019s xAI datacenters in Memphis, Tennessee, were accused of polluting historically Black neighborhoods. The company had moved in dozens of portable methane gas generators to power the facilities, initially without permits, which brought several protests and a pending lawsuit from the NAACP.\nNeuralink, which operates in relative secrecy compared with Musk\u2019s other businesses, accelerated the tests of its brain chips in 2025. The company says its product allows a person limited control of a computer via their thoughts. After announcing its first successful implantation in 2024, the company announced in September that it had completed the procedure in 12 patients.\nThroughout the year, top executives fled the uproar involved in managing Musk\u2019s companies. Linda Yaccarino departed as X\u2019s CEO, as did its advertising chief. xAI lost its co-founder, chief financial officer and lead lawyer. Likewise, Tesla saw several executive exits, including the vice-president of North American sales, the director of the battery team, the head of the \u201cOptimus\u201d robot project and several leaders of the company\u2019s various car divisions.\nA year of personal feuds\nMusk, whose life is frequently animated by grievances and breakups, had a banner year for high-profile fights, even by his own standards. Longstanding feuds reignited while his close relationship with Trump imploded in full public view, all as he posted a steady stream of attacks against immigrants, the trans community, the media, Wikipedia and a host of other targets on X, where he boasts 230 million followers.\nMusk began the year by accusing the government of South Africa, his birth country, of anti-white racism when he sought approval for his Starlink internet provider to operate in the country. It was part of a series of spats Musk would have with governments abroad and world leaders, including declaring that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was \u201ccomplicit in the rape of Britain\u201d in one of his anti-immigration tirades.\nAs Musk picked fights internationally, he also became a combative presence during his time within the Trump administration. Tensions with other administration officials resulted in reports of tense meetings in the Oval Office and a loud, near-physical yelling match between him and treasury secretary Scott Bessent in the halls of the White House. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy became another adversary in a clash over the future of Nasa, with Musk calling him \u201cSean Dummy\u201d on X amid a string of other insults.\nEven Musk and Trump\u2019s formerly close friendship soured, as the president pushed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act that removed tax credits for electric vehicles and threatened to harm Tesla\u2019s already flagging sales. Musk lashed out at Trump on Twitter in June, saying that the bill\u2019s addition to the deficit would destroy the work Doge had done. The deterioration in their relationship culminated in Musk accusing the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, in turn, insinuated he could cancel Musk\u2019s government contracts and said his most prominent financial backer had \u201clost his mind\u201d.\nThe messy, public breakup between Musk and Trump marked the end of the Tesla CEO\u2019s time as self-described \u201cfirst buddy\u201d to the president. Although the two have entered a period of rapprochement in recent months, Musk is far from the constant presence at Trump\u2019s side that he was on the campaign trail.\nMusk\u2019s pivot back to his tech empire allowed him to refocus on other grudges, including against Sam Altman, his former OpenAI business partner turned rival. Musk added to his series of lawsuits against Altman\u2019s AI company with a case in August that alleged Apple and OpenAI were engaging in anticompetitive conduct, an accusation that OpenAI described as part of Musk\u2019s \u201cpattern of harassment\u201d against the firm. The two traded barbs on X, which included fighting over whose posts were getting more views.\nOne of Musk\u2019s final feuds of the year came from a more unusual source \u2013 famed 87-year-old author Joyce Carol Oates, whose cutting observation about him on X received more than 5.6m views.\n\u201cSo curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates \u2013 scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend\u2019s or relative\u2019s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history,\u201d Oates posted in November.\nA day later, after Musk made a show of enthusiastically replying to several clips of movies on X, he responded to Oates\u2019s critique.\n\u201cOates is a liar and delights in being mean,\u201d Musk posted. \u201cNot a good human.\u201d",

The agency said the car company had misled consumers and exaggerated the capabilities of its Autopilot technology. If Tesla doesn\u2019t \u201cremedy the situation\u201d within 90 days, the DMV said earlier in December, the company will be banned from selling cars in the state, its biggest US market. With SpaceX, Musk was able to curry favor with the federal government. Not only did his Starlink satellites continue to dominate the Earth\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 the SpaceX subsidiary operates the vast majority of all satellites in orbit \u2013 but the Federal Aviation Administration and the air force gave SpaceX the go-ahead to increase rocket launches in Florida, Texas and California. This came despite the company\u2019s massive Starship, a 400ft machine that Musk hopes to one day fly to Mars, repeatedly blowing up and showering shrapnel across the Caribbean. One such explosion prompted legal action from Mexico, which said the debris harmed thousands of endangered sea turtle hatchlings. Musk also consolidated his social media and artificial intelligence companies this year. In March, he announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock transaction that he said valued X at $33bn. Both companies are privately held. xAI makes the Grok chatbot, which is integrated into X. The chatbot had countless meltdowns in the second year since its release. It pushed conspiracy theories about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d, claimed Trump won the 2020 election and spewed numerous antisemitic claims, once referring to itself as \u201cMechaHitler\u201d. Nevertheless, Musk was able to seal a $200m contract from the Department of Defense to integrate Grok into federal government tools. Meanwhile, Musk\u2019s xAI datacenters in Memphis, Tennessee, were accused of polluting historically Black neighborhoods. The company had moved in dozens of portable methane gas generators to power the facilities, initially without permits, which brought several protests and a pending lawsuit from the NAACP. Neuralink, which operates in relative secrecy compared with Musk\u2019s other businesses, accelerated the tests of its brain chips in 2025. The company says its product allows a person limited control of a computer via their thoughts. After announcing its first successful implantation in 2024, the company announced in September that it had completed the procedure in 12 patients. Throughout the year, top executives fled the uproar involved in managing Musk\u2019s companies. Linda Yaccarino departed as X\u2019s CEO, as did its advertising chief. xAI lost its co-founder, chief financial officer and lead lawyer. Likewise, Tesla saw several executive exits, including the vice-president of North American sales, the director of the battery team, the head of the \u201cOptimus\u201d robot project and several leaders of the company\u2019s various car divisions. A year of personal feuds Musk, whose life is frequently animated by grievances and breakups, had a banner year for high-profile fights, even by his own standards. Longstanding feuds reignited while his close relationship with Trump imploded in full public view, all as he posted a steady stream of attacks against immigrants, the trans community, the media, Wikipedia and a host of other targets on X, where he boasts 230 million followers. Musk began the year by accusing the government of South Africa, his birth country, of anti-white racism when he sought approval for his Starlink internet provider to operate in the country. It was part of a series of spats Musk would have with governments abroad and world leaders, including declaring that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was \u201ccomplicit in the rape of Britain\u201d in one of his anti-immigration tirades. As Musk picked fights internationally, he also became a combative presence during his time within the Trump administration. Tensions with other administration officials resulted in reports of tense meetings in the Oval Office and a loud, near-physical yelling match between him and treasury secretary Scott Bessent in the halls of the White House. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy became another adversary in a clash over the future of Nasa, with Musk calling him \u201cSean Dummy\u201d on X amid a string of other insults. Even Musk and Trump\u2019s formerly close friendship soured, as the president pushed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act that removed tax credits for electric vehicles and threatened to harm Tesla\u2019s already flagging sales. Musk lashed out at Trump on Twitter in June, saying that the bill\u2019s addition to the deficit would destroy the work Doge had done. The deterioration in their relationship culminated in Musk accusing the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, in turn, insinuated he could cancel Musk\u2019s government contracts and said his most prominent financial backer had \u201clost his mind\u201d. The messy, public breakup between Musk and Trump marked the end of the Tesla CEO\u2019s time as self-described \u201cfirst buddy\u201d to the president. Although the two have entered a period of rapprochement in recent months, Musk is far from the constant presence at Trump\u2019s side that he was on the campaign trail. Musk\u2019s pivot back to his tech empire allowed him to refocus on other grudges, including against Sam Altman, his former OpenAI business partner turned rival. Musk added to his series of lawsuits against Altman\u2019s AI company with a case in August that alleged Apple and OpenAI were engaging in anticompetitive conduct, an accusation that OpenAI described as part of Musk\u2019s \u201cpattern of harassment\u201d against the firm. The two traded barbs on X, which included fighting over whose posts were getting more views. One of Musk\u2019s final feuds of the year came from a more unusual source \u2013 famed 87-year-old author Joyce Carol Oates, whose cutting observation about him on X received more than 5.6m views. \u201cSo curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates \u2013 scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend\u2019s or relative\u2019s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history,\u201d Oates posted in November. A day later, after Musk made a show of enthusiastically replying to several clips of movies on X, he responded to Oates\u2019s critique. \u201cOates is a liar and delights in being mean,\u201d Musk posted. \u201cNot a good human.\u201d",

    "content": "Tesla has taken the unusual step of publishing sales forecasts that suggest 2025 deliveries will be lower than expected and future years\u2019 sales will be well below targets set by its chief executive, Elon Musk.\nThe US electric vehicle maker published figures from analysts suggesting it will announce 423,000 deliveries during the fourth quarter of 2025, in a new \u201cconsensus\u201d section on its investor website. That would represent a 16% decline from the final quarter of 2024.\nThe estimates suggested that Tesla would deliver 1.64m cars in 2025 as a whole, down from 1.79m in 2024.

    "content_clean": "Tesla has taken the unusual step of publishing sales forecasts that suggest 2025 deliveries will be lower than expected and future years\u2019 sales will be well below targets set by its chief executive, Elon Musk. The US electric vehicle maker published figures from analysts suggesting it will announce 423,000 deliveries during the fourth quarter of 2025, in a new \u201cconsensus\u201d section on its investor website.

    "content": "A quick admission: I absolutely love an elliptical or cross trainer. They don\u2019t always get the plaudits they deserve, but these low-impact cardio machines not only put less strain on your joints than a treadmill but also help you get an impressive, full-body workout. Whether you hop on one to warm up before an intense strength-training session or use it to gently burn calories while listening to your favourite podcast, the elliptical or cross trainer can strengthen muscle, reduce fat and improve cardiovascular fitness.\nHowever, there is a catch in that these machines vary wildly in their design \u2013 and therefore the emphasis they place on different muscles. Traditional elliptical machines eschew moving handles, instead opting for static poles, while cross trainers usually have dynamic handles that recruit the muscles in your back, shoulders and arms. On top of this, stride length, the shape of the handles and the positioning of the footplates can make a big difference to the type of workout you\u2019ll have.\nThey can vary considerably in their weight and size, but are usually bulkier and more cumbersome than, say, a compact treadmill. Home gym aficionados beware: you\u2019ll likely need a fair amount of room for one of these. If you have enough space, though, an elliptical or cross trainer can be a valuable addition to your home training setup.\nAt a glance\n-\nBest cross trainer overall:\nBowFlex Max Trainer M6\n-\nBest value elliptical trainer:\nHorizon EX-59\n-\nBest premium elliptical trainer:\nTechnogym elliptical\n-\nBest compact cross trainer:\nJTX Strider-X8\n-\nBest full-body trainer:\nSchwinn 590 Elliptical\nWhy you should trust me\nI\u2019m a keen fitness fan who does gym-based strength training and kickboxing classes, as well as outdoor trail runs, cold-water surfing, and more. As a result, I\u2019ve often been tasked with testing fitness technology for magazines, newspapers and websites. I\u2019ve always been one to get stuck in, whatever I\u2019m testing, whether that means surfing in the latest smartwatch or feeling the burn to test a set of connected kettlebells.\nI\u2019m also a strong believer that you have to use new tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I\u2019ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the correct environment. With exercise ellipticals and cross trainers, that meant getting hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me.\nHow I tested\nAs with any modern piece of fitness equipment, the only way to ascertain whether it\u2019s any good is to don your gym kit and get stuck in. So, after researching the newest and most popular models on the market, I set about trialling all eight of them.\nMost of my testing was carried out in purpose-built boutiques or customer experience centres because accommodating so many examples of such gym equipment in my home is not easy. I did manage to squeeze a couple into my garage via short-term loans, though.\nDuring workouts, I used a smartphone-based decibel reader to get a sense of how loud they were in use, and I also tested any connected or online features, which often meant downloading relevant apps and trialling their workout content.\nWhere trainers had displays, I used these to log in to apps, such as Spotify and YouTube, and I also used any built-in Bluetooth speakers (if this function was offered). For each model, I made notes on ease of use, build quality and any features, as well as the overall size of the machine. If it had transport wheels, I used these to move the trainer around, simulating how easy it would be to manoeuvre in a domestic environment.\nThe best cross trainers and elliptical machines to buy in 2025\nBest value elliptical trainer:\nHorizon EX-59\nAlthough it\u2019s not the cheapest elliptical trainer on this list, the Horizon EX-59 is still my top value pick thanks to its array of features, robust build quality and a relatively low price.\nWhy we love it\nA smooth, front-mounted flywheel provides 10 levels of quiet resistance, and oversize pedals accommodate a variety of different-sized users. With a stride length of 46cm, it\u2019s not dissimilar to the larger elliptical machines you might find at a gym \u2013 meaning it feels more natural and less intense than a stepper or cross trainer.\nThe EX-59 connects to third-party apps via Bluetooth, but it won\u2019t automatically adjust the resistance like some rivals do. As with most Horizon fitness equipment, this model works with the brand\u2019s @Zone app, which provides several high-quality on-demand workouts and training plans for free. There\u2019s not a huge amount of content geared towards elliptical training, but most treadmill and exercise bike high-intensity interval training sessions work just as well.\nTo me, it\u2019s not the prettiest fitness machine, though it certainly does the job, offering drinks holders, a place to stash your smartphone or tablet, and a built-in heart-rate monitor on the static handles.\nThe build quality is great, especially considering the price, although that doesn\u2019t extend to the LCD display and console, which are basic. During testing, I found the changes to resistance inputs slow to react: not great if you\u2019re indulging in a Hiit session and you need to spike the heart rate quickly. Similarly, the built-in Bluetooth speakers aren\u2019t really worth the hassle of tethering a device \u2013 you\u2019d get better sound quality out of a tin can. Instead, bring a pair of headphones, fire up the @Zone workout app and make the most of those free on-demand classes.\nIt\u2019s a shame that \u2026 the Bluetooth speakers are tinny, and ECB magnetic brake resistance is slow to react to inputs.\nDimensions: 61 x 186 x 167cm (WLH)\nWeight: 74.5kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (10 levels)\nStride length: 46cm\nConnectivity: Bluetooth speakers, device rack, USB rapid-charge port; compatible with popular fitness apps via Bluetooth FTMS\nFolding? No\nNoise level: about 42dB\nMaximum user weight: 136kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no touchscreen; has Bluetooth-enabled speakers and a tablet holder for external content\nGreat build quality; good value\nResistance slow to adjust; display and speakers poor\nBest foldable elliptical trainer:\nTechnogym Elliptical\nIf money\u2019s no object, it\u2019s worth a visit to Technogym\u2019s London Mayfair store, which is packed with drool-inducing fitness equipment that will make any home workout space feel like a five-star hotel.\nThis elliptical trainer is part of the brand\u2019s focus on the home and, as such, it folds upright to minimise its footprint in your living room, home gym or \u2013 in my case at least \u2013 cobweb-strewn garage.\nAs a result, it shuns the traditional front- or rear-mounted flywheel for a suspended set of footplates and a resistance system that\u2019s in its upright body. This helps save space but still offers a comparable, almost anti-gravity upper- and lower-body workout to other premium elliptical machines.\nWith 25 difficulty levels and up to 600W of electrically adjustable resistance (up to 160 strides a minute: good luck with that), the elliptical packs a mean punch \u2013 and it works perfectly with the brand\u2019s digital workout portfolio. Having said that, although there\u2019s a basic screen to show all the usual important data, you\u2019ll need to bring your own device if you want any sort of guided workout.\nWhy we love it\nTechnogym\u2019s \u201csessions\u201d are up there with some of Peloton\u2019s interactive classes, although you\u2019ll need to provide your own tablet, smartphone or laptop. Unlike other fitness apps, there are plenty of elliptical-based classes to enjoy, which makes the experience feel much more enjoyable.\nIndeed, where some elliptical trainers can send me to sleep, the instructor in Technogym\u2019s interactive classes will have you hanging off the unit, torching your glutes and pummelling your quads. It will keep you coming back for more.\nThe movement itself takes a bit of getting used to: the stride isn\u2019t quite as obvious as the larger units found in commercial gyms. I had to adapt my approach to get the most out of it, and I found it lacked the multiple grip positions and range of motion for effective upper-body focus training.\nRegardless, this trainer has Technogym quality baked into its core. It offers a huge spread of resistance levels, is virtually silent, and is all wrapped up in one of the most compact, storable and classy units on test.\nIt\u2019s a shame that \u2026 you have to bring a device to enjoy a workout, and Technogym\u2019s monthly subscription fees are, predictably, expensive.\nDimensions: 65 x 162 x 160cm (WLH)\nWeight: 100kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive electronically adjustable magnetic resistance\nStride length: not specified\nConnectivity: tablet-compatible console for use with Technogym\u2019s apps\nFolding? Yes (folds to 75cm length for compact storage)\nNoise level: about 36dB\nMaximum user weight: 130kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; designed for tablet use via console\nClassy, quiet and compact\nYou need a separate device for classes\nBest compact cross trainer:\nJTX Strider-X8\nThe JTX Strider-X8 was one of the most compact true ellipticals I got my hands on: it\u2019s just 130cm long. The BowFlex Max Trainer M6 will fit better into tight spaces, but it doesn\u2019t offer the same kind of traditional elliptical stride.\nWhy we love it\nThe Strider-X8 provides 41cm of glorious gliding, corralled by a 7kg inertia-enhanced flywheel at the rear. It\u2019s quiet, although perhaps not as whisper-quiet as some rivals, and offers 16 levels of easily adjustable resistance.\nHowever, there are a few compromises. The compact proportions restrict the maximum user height to 5ft 9in, which means even a vertically challenged individual like myself is butting up against the limits. The build quality isn\u2019t a strong point: the console, complete with basic display, looks and feels a bit like an oversized school calculator. However, this trainer is very much at the budget end of the budget spectrum. JTX offers a two-year at-home warranty, which should give some peace of mind for those worried it may not go the distance.\nWeighing 51kg, the Strider-X8 isn\u2019t something you will want to pick up and heft around, but it\u2019s easy to tip it on to its transport wheels and stash it somewhere convenient. Without going for a foldable, there are few cross trainers that can compete with it in terms of space-saving \u2013 and I managed to cram it into the corner of my busy garage with little stress.\nThe workout experience is largely fine, although the smaller footplates will be a problem for users with larger feet. It connects seamlessly with third-party apps and can even be used with virtual training software, such as Zwift.\nThe digital console is basic, but it all works, with a simple dial adjusting the levels of resistance. There are even 18 built-in programs for those who simply want to hop on and work out.\nIt\u2019s a shame that \u2026 parts of the machine feel cheap, and the built-in heart-rate monitoring is useless.\nDimensions: 70 x 130 x 169cm (WLH)\nWeight: 51kg\nDrivetrain: 7kg inertia-enhanced flywheel and electromagnetic resistance\nStride length: 41cm\nConnectivity: Bluetooth to fitness apps (such as Kinomap, iConsole+), built-in Polar heart-rate receiver (chest strap), hand pulse sensors\nFolding? No; includes transport wheels\nNoise level: about 38dB\nMaximum user weight: 120kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no; LCD console with 18 workouts\nSuper compact and affordable\nSmall footplates won\u2019t suit larger feet\nBest full-body trainer:\nSchwinn 590 Elliptical\nSchwinn packs a lot into its relatively compact 590 Elliptical, including the ability to electronically adjust the platforms to simulate gradients of -5% to 15%. Along with the multitude of upper-body handles, this sees it bundled into the cross-trainer category (despite its name). I found it offered one of the best full-body workouts on test.\nThere are built-in speakers that are of mediocre quality (they\u2019re better than those found on the Horizon EX-59 but still not brilliant) and a 7in digital display that allows for rapid leaps in resistance.\nWhy we love it\nThere are handle-mounted controls for both the incline/decline and resistance settings, which is a welcome premium touch, and the unit is compatible with a multitude of virtual training software, including Zwift and Schwinn\u2019s recommended Jrny app.\nThe 25 levels of resistance, the ability to adjust the incline and decline, and the multiple grip locations ensure the Schwinn provides one of the best and all-encompassing full-body workouts on test. With a pronated grip on the horizontal handles, I found it possible to work the big muscles of the back and the lats, while a supinated grip on the inner-most handles would place more emphasis on the shoulders and rear deltoid muscles.\nIt\u2019s a similar case for the lower body, as adjusting the decline and incline places a focus on muscles in the legs that I rarely use. Start playing around with body positioning, and it offers all of the benefits of a static hold with dynamic movement.\nOf course, you can adjust the intensity as you want, but I found the unit to be one of the best for working up a sweat. It all comes in one of the most compact and easy-to-store packages on this list, too.\nIt\u2019s a shame that \u2026 the built-in speakers aren\u2019t really worth the effort, and it\u2019s an expensive machine.\nDimensions: 86 x 148 x 173cm (WLH)\nWeight: 96kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive with magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (25 levels)\nStride length: 51cm\nConnectivity: Bluetooth (heart-rate enabled and built-in speakers), USB charging port, tablet/media holder, Jrny and app compatibility\nFolding? No; includes transport wheels\nNoise level: about 32dB\nMaximum user weight: 147kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no; a 7in full-colour LCD with workout programs and connectivity\nOne of the best full-body workouts on test\nIt\u2019s expensive, and speakers are mediocre\nThe best of the rest\nSole E35 elliptical cross trainer\nBest for: taller users\nWith a generous 50.8cm stride length and oversized footplates, the Sole E35 is designed for taller and larger users, offering multiple handles and grip positions for a full-body workout.\nTo me, it\u2019s also one of the better-looking elliptical machines on this list, with modern styling and a sleek 10.1in touchscreen to use for a number of built-in workout sessions and longer-term fitness plans, as well as popular streaming apps, such as YouTube, Disney+ and more.\nThere\u2019s a built-in fan for keeping users cool, although it\u2019s not hugely effective, as well as a set of speakers for streaming music. These are perfectly adequate, but don\u2019t expect room-filling sounds.\nThe 9kg flywheel provides plenty of resistance though, and with the FTMS protocol, it syncs up with Zwift and the brand\u2019s own Sole+ app, offering a huge array of virtual workouts.\nIt didn\u2019t make the final cut because \u2026 it\u2019s a large and heavy machine that requires plenty of storage space.\nDimensions: 60 x 177 x 177cm (WLH); weight: 110.8kg; drivetrain: front-drive with computer-controlled magnetic ECB resistance (20 levels); stride length: 50.8cm; connectivity: Bluetooth audio speakers, USB charging port, wifi, Sole+ and Kinomap app compatibility, tablet holder, wireless charging pad; folding? No; includes front transport wheels; noise level: about 35db; maximum user weight: 158kg; built-in entertainment: 10.1in touchscreen with built-in apps (YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ and so on), wifi and screen mirroring\nGreat for taller users\nTakes up a lot of space\nMatrix Fitness E30\nBest for: gym quality at home\nIt\u2019s a little tricky to get your head around how the Matrix E30 works. On paper, it\u2019s one of the more compact elliptical trainers I tested, yet it still manages to offer a 51cm stride length. This is all down to the clever, and quite complex, suspension system that houses the oversized footplates and traditional elliptical handles.\nMatrix kit is often found in commercial gyms and that\u2019s pretty obvious here, as the build quality is excellent. It also sports a 10.5kg flywheel, which is one of the heaviest on test. It allows for 20 levels of resistance and is capable of a pretty hardcore workout.\nAn updated XER console has a crisp 10in touchscreen that takes care of most of the functionality, as well as allowing access to a handful of streaming apps and virtual training programs.\nIf you don\u2019t want to pay for yet another monthly membership (Matrix suggests iFIT), it can also play nicely with whatever third-party apps you like to use and features 11 built-in workout programs.\nIt didn\u2019t make the final cut because \u2026 it\u2019s expensive, and the screen isn\u2019t overly impressive.\nDimensions: 73x 166 x 148cm (WLH); weight: 126kg; drivetrain: suspension elliptical front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (20 levels); stride length: 51cm; connectivity: wifi, Bluetooth, USB port and entertainment apps (YouTube, Netflix and so on); folding?

A standard elliptical machine focuses on the forward and backward pedalling motion with fixed handles, providing a low-impact cardio workout that mimics running without the joint stress. A cross trainer typically includes moving handlebars that allow you to work your upper body as well, giving a more complete, full-body workout. In most modern home fitness equipment, \u201celliptical\u201d and \u201ccross trainer\u201d usually describe the same type of machine.\nHow much should I spend?\nEntry-level elliptical trainers start at about \u00a3400 and offer basic stride motion and limited resistance levels. Spending more than \u00a31,000 typically gets you a sturdier build, smoother motion, more resistance levels and better consoles with Bluetooth or app integration. At the top end (\u00a32,000+), you\u2019ll find commercial-grade machines with advanced consoles, streaming services, more compact footprints, greater levels of resistance and suspension technology that greatly reduces noise and wear.\nHow much room do I need at home?\nEllipticals tend to be large machines, with footprints ranging from about 150cm in length and 70cm in width, all the way up to 200cm in length and 80cm in width, or more. You\u2019ll also need to consider ceiling height \u2013 especially with front-drive machines, as pedals can lift you an additional 30-40cm off the ground.\nWhat features should I look out for?\nStride length is a key factor: shorter strides (about 40-45cm) are suitable for smaller users, while taller users will benefit from 50cm or more. Look for adjustable resistance levels and incline options if you want to vary the intensity and muscle groups worked. Consoles with Bluetooth and app support can help track progress and keep workouts engaging, and some higher-end models include large touchscreens with streaming apps, fans, speakers and wireless charging pads. If space is a concern, compact or folding designs are worth exploring.\nAre there any maintenance concerns?\nEllipticals are generally low-maintenance compared with treadmills. Most use magnetic resistance systems that don\u2019t require ongoing adjustment as a treadmill\u2019s belt does. Look out for manufacturer warranties that cover any wear and tear. Suspension ellipticals \u2013 which remove the traditional track and wheel system \u2013 tend to be even quieter and need virtually no lubrication.\nFor more ways to get fit at home:\nThe best treadmills, tested by our expert runner\nPersonal trainers on the best home exercise kit\nLeon Poultney is a lifelong fitness enthusiast who can often be found trying not to kill himself on a mountain bike/surfboard/other extreme thing, often at the request of an editor.

    "content_clean": "A quick admission: I absolutely love an elliptical or cross trainer. They don\u2019t always get the plaudits they deserve, but these low-impact cardio machines not only put less strain on your joints than a treadmill but also help you get an impressive, full-body workout. Whether you hop on one to warm up before an intense strength-training session or use it to gently burn calories while listening to your favourite podcast, the elliptical or cross trainer can strengthen muscle, reduce fat and improve cardiovascular fitness. However, there is a catch in that these machines vary wildly in their design \u2013 and therefore the emphasis they place on different muscles. Traditional elliptical machines eschew moving handles, instead opting for static poles, while cross trainers usually have dynamic handles that recruit the muscles in your back, shoulders and arms. On top of this, stride length, the shape of the handles and the positioning of the footplates can make a big difference to the type of workout you\u2019ll have. They can vary considerably in their weight and size, but are usually bulkier and more cumbersome than, say, a compact treadmill. Home gym aficionados beware: you\u2019ll likely need a fair amount of room for one of these. If you have enough space, though, an elliptical or cross trainer can be a valuable addition to your home training setup. At a glance - Best cross trainer overall: BowFlex Max Trainer M6 - Best value elliptical trainer: Horizon EX-59 - Best premium elliptical trainer: Technogym elliptical - Best compact cross trainer: JTX Strider-X8 - Best full-body trainer: Schwinn 590 Elliptical Why you should trust me I\u2019m a keen fitness fan who does gym-based strength training and kickboxing classes, as well as outdoor trail runs, cold-water surfing, and more. As a result, I\u2019ve often been tasked with testing fitness technology for magazines, newspapers and websites. I\u2019ve always been one to get stuck in, whatever I\u2019m testing, whether that means surfing in the latest smartwatch or feeling the burn to test a set of connected kettlebells. I\u2019m also a strong believer that you have to use new tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I\u2019ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the correct environment. With exercise ellipticals and cross trainers, that meant getting hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me. How I tested As with any modern piece of fitness equipment, the only way to ascertain whether it\u2019s any good is to don your gym kit and get stuck in. So, after researching the newest and most popular models on the market, I set about trialling all eight of them. Most of my testing was carried out in purpose-built boutiques or customer experience centres because accommodating so many examples of such gym equipment in my home is not easy. I did manage to squeeze a couple into my garage via short-term loans, though. During workouts, I used a smartphone-based decibel reader to get a sense of how loud they were in use, and I also tested any connected or online features, which often meant downloading relevant apps and trialling their workout content. Where trainers had displays, I used these to log in to apps, such as Spotify and YouTube, and I also used any built-in Bluetooth speakers (if this function was offered). For each model, I made notes on ease of use, build quality and any features, as well as the overall size of the machine. If it had transport wheels, I used these to move the trainer around, simulating how easy it would be to manoeuvre in a domestic environment. The best cross trainers and elliptical machines to buy in 2025 Best value elliptical trainer: Horizon EX-59 Although it\u2019s not the cheapest elliptical trainer on this list, the Horizon EX-59 is still my top value pick thanks to its array of features, robust build quality and a relatively low price. Why we love it A smooth, front-mounted flywheel provides 10 levels of quiet resistance, and oversize pedals accommodate a variety of different-sized users. With a stride length of 46cm, it\u2019s not dissimilar to the larger elliptical machines you might find at a gym \u2013 meaning it feels more natural and less intense than a stepper or cross trainer. The EX-59 connects to third-party apps via Bluetooth, but it won\u2019t automatically adjust the resistance like some rivals do. As with most Horizon fitness equipment, this model works with the brand\u2019s @Zone app, which provides several high-quality on-demand workouts and training plans for free. There\u2019s not a huge amount of content geared towards elliptical training, but most treadmill and exercise bike high-intensity interval training sessions work just as well. To me, it\u2019s not the prettiest fitness machine, though it certainly does the job, offering drinks holders, a place to stash your smartphone or tablet, and a built-in heart-rate monitor on the static handles. The build quality is great, especially considering the price, although that doesn\u2019t extend to the LCD display and console, which are basic. During testing, I found the changes to resistance inputs slow to react: not great if you\u2019re indulging in a Hiit session and you need to spike the heart rate quickly. Similarly, the built-in Bluetooth speakers aren\u2019t really worth the hassle of tethering a device \u2013 you\u2019d get better sound quality out of a tin can. Instead, bring a pair of headphones, fire up the @Zone workout app and make the most of those free on-demand classes. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 the Bluetooth speakers are tinny, and ECB magnetic brake resistance is slow to react to inputs. Dimensions: 61 x 186 x 167cm (WLH) Weight: 74.5kg Drivetrain: front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (10 levels) Stride length: 46cm Connectivity: Bluetooth speakers, device rack, USB rapid-charge port; compatible with popular fitness apps via Bluetooth FTMS Folding? No Noise level: about 42dB Maximum user weight: 136kg Built-in entertainment: no touchscreen; has Bluetooth-enabled speakers and a tablet holder for external content Great build quality; good value Resistance slow to adjust; display and speakers poor Best foldable elliptical trainer: Technogym Elliptical If money\u2019s no object, it\u2019s worth a visit to Technogym\u2019s London Mayfair store, which is packed with drool-inducing fitness equipment that will make any home workout space feel like a five-star hotel. This elliptical trainer is part of the brand\u2019s focus on the home and, as such, it folds upright to minimise its footprint in your living room, home gym or \u2013 in my case at least \u2013 cobweb-strewn garage. As a result, it shuns the traditional front- or rear-mounted flywheel for a suspended set of footplates and a resistance system that\u2019s in its upright body. This helps save space but still offers a comparable, almost anti-gravity upper- and lower-body workout to other premium elliptical machines. With 25 difficulty levels and up to 600W of electrically adjustable resistance (up to 160 strides a minute: good luck with that), the elliptical packs a mean punch \u2013 and it works perfectly with the brand\u2019s digital workout portfolio. Having said that, although there\u2019s a basic screen to show all the usual important data, you\u2019ll need to bring your own device if you want any sort of guided workout. Why we love it Technogym\u2019s \u201csessions\u201d are up there with some of Peloton\u2019s interactive classes, although you\u2019ll need to provide your own tablet, smartphone or laptop. Unlike other fitness apps, there are plenty of elliptical-based classes to enjoy, which makes the experience feel much more enjoyable. Indeed, where some elliptical trainers can send me to sleep, the instructor in Technogym\u2019s interactive classes will have you hanging off the unit, torching your glutes and pummelling your quads. It will keep you coming back for more. The movement itself takes a bit of getting used to: the stride isn\u2019t quite as obvious as the larger units found in commercial gyms. I had to adapt my approach to get the most out of it, and I found it lacked the multiple grip positions and range of motion for effective upper-body focus training. Regardless, this trainer has Technogym quality baked into its core. It offers a huge spread of resistance levels, is virtually silent, and is all wrapped up in one of the most compact, storable and classy units on test. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 you have to bring a device to enjoy a workout, and Technogym\u2019s monthly subscription fees are, predictably, expensive. Dimensions: 65 x 162 x 160cm (WLH) Weight: 100kg Drivetrain: front-drive electronically adjustable magnetic resistance Stride length: not specified Connectivity: tablet-compatible console for use with Technogym\u2019s apps Folding? Yes (folds to 75cm length for compact storage) Noise level: about 36dB Maximum user weight: 130kg Built-in entertainment: no built-in screen; designed for tablet use via console Classy, quiet and compact You need a separate device for classes Best compact cross trainer: JTX Strider-X8 The JTX Strider-X8 was one of the most compact true ellipticals I got my hands on: it\u2019s just 130cm long. The BowFlex Max Trainer M6 will fit better into tight spaces, but it doesn\u2019t offer the same kind of traditional elliptical stride. Why we love it The Strider-X8 provides 41cm of glorious gliding, corralled by a 7kg inertia-enhanced flywheel at the rear. It\u2019s quiet, although perhaps not as whisper-quiet as some rivals, and offers 16 levels of easily adjustable resistance. However, there are a few compromises. The compact proportions restrict the maximum user height to 5ft 9in, which means even a vertically challenged individual like myself is butting up against the limits. The build quality isn\u2019t a strong point: the console, complete with basic display, looks and feels a bit like an oversized school calculator. However, this trainer is very much at the budget end of the budget spectrum. JTX offers a two-year at-home warranty, which should give some peace of mind for those worried it may not go the distance. Weighing 51kg, the Strider-X8 isn\u2019t something you will want to pick up and heft around, but it\u2019s easy to tip it on to its transport wheels and stash it somewhere convenient. Without going for a foldable, there are few cross trainers that can compete with it in terms of space-saving \u2013 and I managed to cram it into the corner of my busy garage with little stress. The workout experience is largely fine, although the smaller footplates will be a problem for users with larger feet. It connects seamlessly with third-party apps and can even be used with virtual training software, such as Zwift. The digital console is basic, but it all works, with a simple dial adjusting the levels of resistance. There are even 18 built-in programs for those who simply want to hop on and work out. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 parts of the machine feel cheap, and the built-in heart-rate monitoring is useless. Dimensions: 70 x 130 x 169cm (WLH) Weight: 51kg Drivetrain: 7kg inertia-enhanced flywheel and electromagnetic resistance Stride length: 41cm Connectivity: Bluetooth to fitness apps (such as Kinomap, iConsole+), built-in Polar heart-rate receiver (chest strap), hand pulse sensors Folding? No; includes transport wheels Noise level: about 38dB Maximum user weight: 120kg Built-in entertainment: no; LCD console with 18 workouts Super compact and affordable Small footplates won\u2019t suit larger feet Best full-body trainer: Schwinn 590 Elliptical Schwinn packs a lot into its relatively compact 590 Elliptical, including the ability to electronically adjust the platforms to simulate gradients of -5% to 15%. Along with the multitude of upper-body handles, this sees it bundled into the cross-trainer category (despite its name). I found it offered one of the best full-body workouts on test. There are built-in speakers that are of mediocre quality (they\u2019re better than those found on the Horizon EX-59 but still not brilliant) and a 7in digital display that allows for rapid leaps in resistance. Why we love it There are handle-mounted controls for both the incline/decline and resistance settings, which is a welcome premium touch, and the unit is compatible with a multitude of virtual training software, including Zwift and Schwinn\u2019s recommended Jrny app. The 25 levels of resistance, the ability to adjust the incline and decline, and the multiple grip locations ensure the Schwinn provides one of the best and all-encompassing full-body workouts on test. With a pronated grip on the horizontal handles, I found it possible to work the big muscles of the back and the lats, while a supinated grip on the inner-most handles would place more emphasis on the shoulders and rear deltoid muscles. It\u2019s a similar case for the lower body, as adjusting the decline and incline places a focus on muscles in the legs that I rarely use. Start playing around with body positioning, and it offers all of the benefits of a static hold with dynamic movement. Of course, you can adjust the intensity as you want, but I found the unit to be one of the best for working up a sweat. It all comes in one of the most compact and easy-to-store packages on this list, too. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 the built-in speakers aren\u2019t really worth the effort, and it\u2019s an expensive machine. Dimensions: 86 x 148 x 173cm (WLH) Weight: 96kg Drivetrain: front-drive with magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (25 levels) Stride length: 51cm Connectivity: Bluetooth (heart-rate enabled and built-in speakers), USB charging port, tablet/media holder, Jrny and app compatibility Folding? No; includes transport wheels Noise level: about 32dB Maximum user weight: 147kg Built-in entertainment: no; a 7in full-colour LCD with workout programs and connectivity One of the best full-body workouts on test It\u2019s expensive, and speakers are mediocre The best of the rest Sole E35 elliptical cross trainer Best for: taller users With a generous 50.8cm stride length and oversized footplates, the Sole E35 is designed for taller and larger users, offering multiple handles and grip positions for a full-body workout. To me, it\u2019s also one of the better-looking elliptical machines on this list, with modern styling and a sleek 10.1in touchscreen to use for a number of built-in workout sessions and longer-term fitness plans, as well as popular streaming apps, such as YouTube, Disney+ and more. There\u2019s a built-in fan for keeping users cool, although it\u2019s not hugely effective, as well as a set of speakers for streaming music. These are perfectly adequate, but don\u2019t expect room-filling sounds. The 9kg flywheel provides plenty of resistance though, and with the FTMS protocol, it syncs up with Zwift and the brand\u2019s own Sole+ app, offering a huge array of virtual workouts. It didn\u2019t make the final cut because \u2026 it\u2019s a large and heavy machine that requires plenty of storage space. Dimensions: 60 x 177 x 177cm (WLH); weight: 110.8kg; drivetrain: front-drive with computer-controlled magnetic ECB resistance (20 levels); stride length: 50.8cm; connectivity: Bluetooth audio speakers, USB charging port, wifi, Sole+ and Kinomap app compatibility, tablet holder, wireless charging pad; folding? No; includes front transport wheels; noise level: about 35db; maximum user weight: 158kg; built-in entertainment: 10.1in touchscreen with built-in apps (YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ and so on), wifi and screen mirroring Great for taller users Takes up a lot of space Matrix Fitness E30 Best for: gym quality at home It\u2019s a little tricky to get your head around how the Matrix E30 works. On paper, it\u2019s one of the more compact elliptical trainers I tested, yet it still manages to offer a 51cm stride length. This is all down to the clever, and quite complex, suspension system that houses the oversized footplates and traditional elliptical handles. Matrix kit is often found in commercial gyms and that\u2019s pretty obvious here, as the build quality is excellent. It also sports a 10.5kg flywheel, which is one of the heaviest on test. It allows for 20 levels of resistance and is capable of a pretty hardcore workout. An updated XER console has a crisp 10in touchscreen that takes care of most of the functionality, as well as allowing access to a handful of streaming apps and virtual training programs. If you don\u2019t want to pay for yet another monthly membership (Matrix suggests iFIT), it can also play nicely with whatever third-party apps you like to use and features 11 built-in workout programs. It didn\u2019t make the final cut because \u2026 it\u2019s expensive, and the screen isn\u2019t overly impressive. Dimensions: 73x 166 x 148cm (WLH); weight: 126kg; drivetrain: suspension elliptical front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (20 levels); stride length: 51cm; connectivity: wifi, Bluetooth, USB port and entertainment apps (YouTube, Netflix and so on); folding? No; noise level: about 38dB; maximum user weight: 147kg; built-in entertainment: 10in touchscreen with apps, media streaming, web browser (XER console) Excellent quality The quality comes at a high price Life Fitness E1 Best for: build quality on a budget Life Fitness is another brand often selected by commercial gyms for its reliability, and this also filters down into its domestic range. Considering how basic the E1 feels compared with some rivals, the price seems high, but this is a fuss-free elliptical with a massive fixed stride length, oversized footplates and an impressive spread of smooth and natural-feeling resistance. It\u2019s also quiet. The basic digital Go Console lacks the flashiness of a massive interactive touchscreen, but it has 13 workout programs that are easily accessed via large and obvious buttons, great for those not fussed about binging Netflix during a workout. During testing, I found the lack of a touchscreen quite refreshing: it was easy to hop on and work out without the faff of connecting Bluetooth-enabled devices. Heart-rate monitoring is fairly reliable via its handles and sports the FTMS protocol for third-party app integration, but it also works perfectly well without it, and its built-in programs span hill training and fat-burning sessions. It didn\u2019t make the final cut because \u2026 it feels expensive for what it is and looks dated. Dimensions: 77 x 209 x 150cm (WLH); weight: 96kg; drivetrain: front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (20 levels); stride length: 51cm; connectivity: Go Console with LCD, Bluetooth telemetry heart-rate monitoring, 13 pre-loaded workouts; folding? No; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 182kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in media apps; simple display for workout metrics and an integrated accessory tray for external device placement Fuss-free and simple to use Feels basic compared with competitors What you need to know What is the difference between an elliptical and a cross trainer?

And a lot of (justified) hand-wringing over Roblox.\nBut first: I wanted to extend heartfelt thanks to everyone who reads this newsletter and the rest of our work at the Guardian. If you\u2019ve enjoyed our coverage, do consider supporting us to do more of it \u2013 either through a recurring or one-off contribution.

Thank you for being with us in 2025, and I hope you stick around to watch me slowly lose my mind working overtime in the buildup to Grand Theft Auto 6\u2019s release in November 2026. (Finally).\nIn no particular order, here are the most read feature articles of the year.\nMy chilling week on Roblox: sexually assaulted and shat on as a child avatar roaming the online world\nThe Guardian covered Roblox a lot in 2025, mostly from the perspective of child safety. As Sarah Martin discovered in this article, it is extremely easy to get into inappropriate situations and chats in this free-for-all of a game platform, which has more than 150m daily users (most of them children). I am no fan of Roblox and don\u2019t let my own kids play it, but if your little ones get joy out of it and you don\u2019t want to prohibit the game entirely I recommend making sure it\u2019s supervised where possible and those parental controls are locked down.\nI cannot stop playing this preposterous game about falling down a mountain\nFor some reason this tale of my self-flagellating travails with Baby Steps seemed to speak to a lot of people. I felt somewhat vindicated for spending more than 12 hours of my life marching a useless person up a hill.\nMaster System at 40: the truth about Sega\u2019s most underrated console\nOur games correspondent Keith Stuart, goes down one of his favourite rabbit holes here, emerging with a wonderfully researched tribute to one of Sega\u2019s lesser-appreciated consoles. Revisionist history often crowns the NES as the winner of the 80s console wars, but that was only true in Japan and the US \u2013 in Europe, home computers and the Sega Master System reigned.\nElon Musk stands accused of pretending to be good at video games. The irony is delicious\nI must admit that this was extremely satisfying to write. After boasting about his gaming prowess on X, Elon Musk was revealed to have been cheating in some baffling attempt to appropriate gamer credibility. As the year wore on, this proved to be just one of many embarrassing self-owns from the richest man in the world.\nWhy Trump\u2019s White House is using video game memes to recruit for ICE\nGames have a lot of economic and cultural power. They were the original site of the modern online culture wars, during Gamergate, and now the Trump administration isn\u2019t shy to use gamer imagery to mobilise its base. This report from Alyssa Mercante is a story about how Pok\u00e9mon and Halo imagery is being used to recruit for ICE, but also a story about where games sit now in the wider political context of our times.\nMeet the new James Bond: how 007 First Light earned its licence to thrill\nWho needs Grand Theft Auto: the upcoming game that Guardian readers are most psyched for in 2026 is 007 First Light. Possibly because the films\u2019 future was still up in the air when it was announced, or maybe because the love for GoldenEye 007 still runs deep. Joshua Rivera interviews the people at IO Interactive who persuaded Eon Productions to let them loose on James Bond.\nUnreal estate: the 12 greatest homes in video game history\nList features get a bad rap but this is such a good, thoughtful example of the form, in my (biased) opinion, from Keith Stuart and Christian Donlan. We remember the places we tread in games as if they were real, and some of these virtual mansions feel like childhood homes. (We should be so lucky as to grow up in Croft Manor.)\nGaming in their golden years: why millions of seniors are playing video games\nI know many Pushing Buttons readers are gamers of a certain vintage. Adrienne Matei speaks to some of Twitch\u2019s older video game streamers (much love to TacticalGramma) to find out why half of people over 60 play video games, and the potential benefits of doing so.\nWhy do some gamers invert their controls? Scientists now have answers \u2013 but they\u2019re not what you think\nThis story has been ongoing in the Guardian games pages for years, ever since Keith wrote what he thought would be a very niche article querying why some people play games upside down. Finally, after that article inspired an actual scientific study, we have the answer.\nBillion-dollar video game: is this the most expensive piece of entertainment ever made?\nI have been interested in the spaceship game Star Citizen for a long time, mostly because I have wondered where the hundreds of millions of pounds it has raised in funding were actually going. (It\u2019s been \u201cin development\u201d since 2012 and its creators don\u2019t pretend it is anywhere close to finished.) Oliver Holmes talks to players to find out why they have invested thousands in this science-fiction dream. Since this article was published, Star Citizen\u2019s revenue has risen to $924,266,846, and it now has six million players.\nWhat to play\nThis week, I will be playing Guitar Hero and Rock Band, as I have small children and can\u2019t go out for Hogmanay. So instead I\u2019m getting all the ancient plastic instruments out of the attic and bringing the party to me. I can\u2019t insist that you do anything so impractical \u2013 last time I tried this I got the dreaded red ring of death on my trusty old Xbox 360 and the whole plan fell apart \u2013 but if you do have some forgotten SingStar mics and an old PlayStation two or three hidden away, this is your PSA that all of it still works, and actually it\u2019s just as fun as it was in 2008. Happy new year!\nAvailable on: 2010s console of your choice\nEstimated playtime: Twenty years and counting\nWhat to click\nQuestion Block\nNo reader question this week because we\u2019re all still on holiday, but to kick off 2026, I\u2019d like to invite you to write in with a few sentences on your most anticipated game(s) of the next year.

But then, in the year just past, when bigotry in frontline politics took off its training wheels and othering became the sport that everyone can play, the notion that someone who clearly belongs here should not belong here ceased to shock.\nBad stuff happened in 2025. The big stuff you know: the violent, toxically nativist besieging of asylum seeker hotels and the condoning of it by rightwing politicians and media outlets. The deployment up and down the country by hard-right activists of the British and St George\u2019s flag, as a symbol, not of collective adhesion (as it surely can be) but of intimidation. The very public claims that Farage, a man with pretensions to lead our country, hurt people as a racist school bully and refuses to atone or suitably acknowledge their hurt now that he is a dog-whistling adult.\nBut I\u2019m also thinking of less high-profile stuff. Like the friend who went for a weekend out of London into summery, leafy Middle England and, while waiting at a road junction, was assailed as a \u201cblack bitch\u201d by a car passenger waiting at the lights, seeking to prove to an even younger passenger \u2013 perhaps his own son \u2013 that he wasn\u2019t constrained by the strictures of woke.\nLike the student who, along with his father, entered a pub in the West Country \u2013 to sample the local colour, watch a bit of football \u2013 and was advised to leave because it wasn\u2019t a good or safe place for \u201cPakis\u201d. Like the health worker friend whose job entails driving into towns and villages, who continued to do so amid the summer explosion of union flags but who said that as a black man entering those places, he felt, for the first time, the need to watch his back. All were acting as if they belong, with infinite justification. All were given reason to doubt. Diehard populists and racists want that kind of Britain and they\u2019ve had a good year. According to a new study by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), the number of people absorbing and mirroring hard right narratives is rising. Time to take stock: divided, resentful, hostile to all but a default culture \u2013 is that the sort of country the rest of us want?\nAgainst this backdrop, and at a time when a small but growing minority says you have to be white to be British, I have been thinking about minority belonging and attachment. I was born here, schooled here, have worked and paid taxes here, have served communities: but as the son of Windrush parents, how solid is my footing here? My late parents arrived in the 1950s and thought their status was secure. Then came the 1971 Immigration Act, which ripped up the rights they had as Commonwealth citizens and necessitated that they scramble to find the money to solidify their status under the government\u2019s new arrangements. As a child I overheard the strained discussions about where the money was going to come from. The sound of shock and uncertainty.\nWe are settled, but never quite cosy. How can we be? Using the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the home secretary can pull the rug out from under a British citizen, without notification, if doing so meets their particular criteria of the public good. Earlier this year, research by the Runnymede Trust suggested that 9 million people \u2013 mainly those with dual nationalities \u2013 are vulnerable to losing the citizenship they thought was theirs, with minority citizens 12 times more vulnerable than white. This is us: you belong until, maybe, one day, you don\u2019t.\nGo home, Farage\u2019s man said, and with that he echoed the exhortation of choice from nativist crowds outside asylum seeker hotels this summer. In the 50s and 60s, my parents\u2019 generation of Windrush-era migrants used to hear that a lot too. But then, as now, it was a nonsense. Home to where? Where you have lived the longest? To your last port of call? To wherever will have you? We don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why politicians sought to shuttle folk off to Rwanda in the hope they would sort out the home/belonging conundrum themselves.\nWhere am I from? Where\u2019s home if not here? Well certainly there is a quiet, leafy bit of Jamaica that my parents left in the 50s and returned to almost 40 years later. But this year, having paid the fee and explored my DNA, I\u2019ve found there is a viable case that home could be a lot of places. Via Mum, according to the Ancestry results, there are traces from Benin and Togo, with a good bit of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana, a smidgen of Nigeria, a little bit of Mali and a sliver of north-east Scotland. There\u2019s even a drop of Iceland. Go figure.\nFrom Dad, a bit of Benin and Togo, a bit more from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, but most notably Nigeria. I am unsurprised. A Nigerian friend once glanced at a picture of my father and said, never mind Jamaica, \u201cHe\u2019s from Nigeria: no question\u201d. But here, again a mix: a chunk of Devon and Somerset, a little bit of Cameroon and Mali. Some Senegal, some Panama and Costa Rica. And then a trace of the Netherlands. Well, I do enjoy trips to Rotterdam.\nI find all this energising, and certainly it challenges the idea that we are identity parcels labelled from one destination, ready to be returned to sender.\nI am not a citizen of nowhere, as demonised by the populists, but through history, politics, cruelty and happenstance, a creature from almost everywhere. My guess is that many of you are the same \u2013 and that David Lammy is similar, too.\nThat\u2019s the truth of it, and a conversation about home and belonging that starts from there would undoubtedly be more positive.

The grandstand was still up, covered in windblown debris as Leyba's home burned down.\n\"I told the kids, pack an overnight bag, we'll be back tomorrow,\" she remembered. \"We never came back, and we never said goodbye to our home.\"\nBut she's finding her community again through work on the float, which is decorated entirely by fire survivors.\nThe Rose Parade is a New Year's Day tradition for millions of viewers who tune in on TV to see the creative displays of Southern California's natural bounty roll through the streets of Pasadena. For locals, it has long been a point of pride to be included among the many float crews, marching bands, and equestrian performers that have participated in the event since the first Tournament of Roses in 1890.\n\"I'm going, my God, I'm representing Altadena, all these people who have lost their homes and live in the community,\" marveled Leyba. \"So, it's an honor.\"\n\"It's really kind of a living memorial of beautiful flowers and organic material, in a very LA experience that the world is watching,\" said Miguel Santana, CEO of California Community Foundation, a charity organization that funds wildfire recovery and sponsored the float.\nSantana said many survivors are having a tough time as the anniversary of the fires approaches.\n\"People are really starting to feel a real mental breakdown,\" he said. \"Folks are really struggling to navigate an insurance system that is failing them. For many people, the fact that the federal government hasn't provided the relief that it has for other natural disasters around the country, they're struggling.\"\nIn addition to reminding the nation of the ongoing need for assistance, Santana hoped the float would be a healing way to bring survivors together and create something beautiful to mark the moment.\n\"One person shared today that this is the first event that he's attended following the fires,\" Santana recalled. \"He had lost his sister and was reluctant to go to anything, but because the Rose Parade is such a part of his own life being from Altadena, it felt right.\"\nThat survivor decorated one of 31 sunflowers; each represents someone who died in the fires. During construction in the float barn, the honor of installing the sunflowers was reserved for surviving friends and family, many of whom shared stories of their loved ones as they worked.\n\"We're hoping that, even for just one day, when they see that float going down a street that they're all familiar with, that they know that the world does care about them, that they're not alone in their journey of grief,\" says Santana.\n\"At first, it was very taxing to be around people,\" said Myra Berg, a survivor of the Palisades Fire. \"But when I look around me and see other people who have lost their homes or who have smoke damage, I want to help.\"\nBerg said she liked being up high in the scaffolds, working on the phoenix.\n\"I enjoyed the hell out of it!\"\nLike many of the volunteers, it's not the only construction project she's got going on right now \u2014 she hopes to have her Malibu home rebuilt around this time next year \u2014 but the speed at which the float has come together is gratifying compared to the slow pace of permitting and rebuilding a house.\n\"Another reporter asked if working on the float has been therapeutic. And I thought, 'Oh, therapeutic! I'm moving forward at this point,\" Berg jokes.\n\"I think it's good for the world to know that there is something that honors the survivors and the victims.

    "body": "The final episode of fifth season of the Netflix series Stranger Things is out this week, and the concept of a wormhole figures largely into it. While the show is a work of fiction, theoretical wormholes have making appearances for decades not only in science fiction but in actual science.",
    "content": "What Stranger Things gets right about wormholes\nThe wormhole concept is explained in the fifth season of Stranger Things when science teacher Scott Clarke \u2014 played by Randy Havens \u2013\u2013 tries to get his class interested in it. \"What's neat about wormholes?\" he asks them, standing in front of a chalkboard.\nHis star student, Erica \u2014 played by Priah Ferguson \u2014 eagerly raises her hand.\n\"They allow matter to travel between galaxies or dimensions without crossing the space between,\" she says from the front row.\nThe story is set in Indiana in a fictional town called Hawkins that gets caught up with a paranormal world and its various villains. Much of Stranger Things is a love letter to the 80s; this scene is straight out of a John Hughes movie.\nCredit for its scientific underpinnings however, goes to Albert Einstein.\nWhat is a wormhole?\nWormholes are a staple of Hollywood and science fiction \u2014 a handy device for any kind of space or time travel. They make appearances in places including the writing of Carl Sagan, Star Trek, or the 2014 film Interstellar.\n\"Just think of all the places mankind could go,\" Haven says in wonder during the Stranger Things classroom scene. \"Another galaxy, another time even.\"\nThe wormhole concept emerged from Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Theoretical physicists still use it to explore scientific questions today. \"It's a hugely interesting and helpful toy model for physicists to play with,\" says Sean Carroll, professor of theoretical physics at Johns Hopkins University.\nAt the core of Einstein's theory is the idea that the universe is basically a single swath of fabric, with space and time woven into one continuum. In 1935, Einstein and his colleague Nathan Rosen found a mathematical solution that suggested this spacetime continuum could form a kind of tunnel connecting two distant points, called an Einstein-Rosen bridge. Later physicists realized that such a tunnel \u2014 now called a wormhole \u2014 could act like a cosmic shortcut.\n\" If you travel faster than the speed of light, then there's really no difference between traveling to the future and traveling to the past,\" says Carroll.\nCarroll and other scientists stress that wormholes are theoretical. There are many practical obstacles to their existence. But as a device \u2014 whether for plot or for science \u2014 their applications are endless. \"You can use them to study quantum entanglement and its relationship to emergent space time,\" he says.\nWormholes: Connecting hard science and pop culture\nPhysicist John Archibald Wheeler used the term wormhole in 1957; it was popularized when the astronomer and planetary scientist Carl Sagan wrote about wormholes as a way to facilitate interstellar travel in his novel Contact.\nSince then, says Carroll, Hollywood and the field of physics have had a kind of symbiotic relationship around wormholes. \" The pop-culture need for a way to get across space very, very quickly has actually been a big reason why physicists talk about wormholes all the time these days,\" he says.\nIn 1988, theoretical physicists Kip Thorne and Michael Morris published a scientific investigation into the existence of wormholes. Their work showed that wormholes would require exotic forms of matter to hold them open \u2014 making them impossible to exist or traverse.\nNo matter to Hollywood writers, who continued to lean on them for interstellar travel. Today they are a much loved trope. Carroll has been a consultant to directors and writers on the subject, including those of the 2011 film Thor. In a meeting with the director, he remembers offering a wormhole as a device to get Thor from Earth to another planet quickly. \"They said, 'We can't call it a wormhole, that sounds too '80s,'\" he recalls.\nIn the movie, a scientist played by Natalie Portman's character uses the original name, Einstein-Rosen bridge. When another character asks what that is, she clarifies, \"it's a wormhole.\"\n\"So yes,\" says Carroll, \"it's completely entered the popular imagination.\"\nIn 2022, a wormhole controversy broke out when a team of physicists published a paper in the journal Nature that claimed they created a kind of holographic wormhole using Google's quantum computer chip, Sycamore. Scientists objected to their characterization, pointing out that it could mislead the public into thinking it proved the existence of actual wormholes.\n\"They were doing kind of very straightforward things that just used standard quantum mechanics, making various kinds of exotic conjectures,\" says Peter Woit, who teaches mathematics at Columbia University.\nWormholes, he says, are a known and tempting intoxicant to the public.\n\"They had a whole well-thought-out publicity campaign,\" he says, which he calls \"scientifically dubious,\" but \"incredibly effective.\"\nBeyond the wormhole\nThe Stranger Things fever has also taken hold in the UK, says Carsten Welsch, a professor of physics at University of Liverpool. Welsch regularly takes advantage of his students' enthusiasm by using the series and concepts like wormholes in the classroom.\n\" It's a really good way to talk about science, which can be quite a challenge, especially with, with teenagers,\" he says. \"Normally the moment you mention physics or engineering, they run away.\"\nHe started using the show for instruction after his daughter told him he could no longer rely on Star Wars to help explain the principles of physics. \"She told me I have to do something different because that doesn't connect with everybody,\" he says. \"And she loves Stranger Things.\"\nWelsch admires the show's use of many of the principles of science and theoretical physics, beyond the wormhole. The world of the upside down \u2014 which figures largely into the plot \u2014 he calls \"nearly a perfect analogy\" for the idea of antimatter research.\nIn the show, the upside down is a mirror image to the physical world, existing in a dimension below the Earth. \"The anti-particle is a mirror image to the particle,\" he explains. \" When you overlay some of these images, you can literally picture exactly what's going on in the show as it happens in our labs.\"\nWelsch is grateful to the creators of Stranger Things for folding these scientific concepts into the show, and says parsing what about their representations is true or possible creates an opportunity for rich inquiry. \" It's basically opening a dialogue about \u2014 are there maybe other forces? Are there things that we do not understand in the universe?\"\nThe nerds are the ones saving the world in this series. In the Stranger Things classroom scene, Erica's classmates are too cool or too bored to care about wormholes. Yet a key breakthrough happens when another character, Dustin \u2014 played by Gaten Matarazzo \u2014 identifies a real wormhole before it destroys the world.\nWormholes may not be able to deliver us into other dimensions \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 but Welsch hopes they can help inspire the next generation of scientific heroes.",

    "body": "A bumpy snailfish, Andean mouse opossum and ancient sea cow were just some of the many species described in 2025.",
    "content": "Meet five new species discovered in 2025\nEven as some scientists search for signs of life beyond Earth, other researchers have been discovering new species on our own humble planet faster than ever before.\nFrom high up in the mountains to the deep sea, take a tour across the world to meet five new species discovered in 2025.\nAn ancient sea cow in the Persian Gulf\nCows often get a bad rap for contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, but a newly discovered species of their ocean counterparts suggests that sea cows have been key contributors to a natural climate change solution for the past 21 million years.\nThis long-extinct sea cow's fossil remains were discovered in Al Maszhabiya, Qatar, which is now known to be the richest fossil sea cow deposit in the world. Like today's manatees and dugongs, it mainly grazed on seagrass and was considered an \"ecosystem engineer\" in the coastal waters of the Persian Gulf, where it primarily lived.\nWith their fleshy muzzles, these mammals would browse the seafloor, grab the plants, and use their tusks to snip the roots and eat them. In the process, they lift up nutrients from the seafloor that would otherwise be buried, which other animals in the ecosystem can use. These nutrients, in addition to the sea cow's excrement, help cultivate a healthier and more diverse ecosystem.\n\"Supporting seagrass communities through ecosystem engineering is a great natural climate solution, because seagrass communities store an incredible amount of carbon,\" says Nicholas Pyenson, curator of fossil marine mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.\nThe name of the new species, Salwasiren qatarensis, honors the fossil's discovery site in Qatar, and the Bay of Salwa in the Persian Gulf, where the largest herd of dugongs can be found today. But Pyenson says Salwa, an Arabic word which roughly translates to \"solace,\" is also a nod to the potential for the new species to \"elevate the visibility and protection of natural heritage,\" adding that \"natural heritage doesn't actually, in all cases, respect geopolitical boundaries.\"\nPyenson is referring to the fact that the seagrass meadow in the Bay of Salwa spans the coasts of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. His colleagues are currently in the process of applying for UNESCO World Heritage status to protect the region.\n\"This is a great example of science diplomacy,\" Pyenson says, \"where data sharing, making data open access and available when you publish, has the potential to actually form a metaphorical bridge between countries that maybe have not historically seen eye to eye.\"\nYou can see a 3D model of the sea cow fossil here.\nA mini marsupial in the Andes Mountains\nA beady-eyed mouse opossum living high up in the Peruvian Andes wasn't what Silvia Pavan initially set out to find during her expedition in R\u00edo Abiseo National Park, but the new species gives yet another reason why this special region is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nPavan, an assistant professor at Cal Poly Humboldt, was on the hunt for a specific squirrel species when she and her colleagues came across an animal they eventually named Marmosa chachapoya to honor the Chachapoya people who formerly occupied the area.\nThe tiny marsupial (which, despite its scientific name, is not a marmoset) was the first small mammal that the researchers collected on their trip. While the animal looked a lot like a mouse opossum, its long and delicate snout and home high in the mountains set it apart from other marmosa species. But once Pavan brought the samples back, DNA analysis \u2014 coupled with a close examination of its skull \u2014 proved that this was indeed a new species.\nThe high-altitude area of the mountains where the expedition took place is difficult to access, but Pavan says these underexplored areas are even more important to study: \"We do not know yet completely what we have, and it highlights how much we still need to explore and study the area, and how unique and important [it] is for biodiversity.\"\nWith the threat of climate change and human impact, Pavan says, \"the species are being lost before we know they exist.\"\nOn this trip alone, the team of researchers collected roughly 100 different specimens that they are continuing to identify.\nAn undercover spider in Northern California\nMarshal Hedin was walking along the river near where he grew up in Northern California when he came across a spider he hadn't seen before. Fifteen years later, the professor of biology at San Diego State University finally got to identify it as a new species of an entirely new genus, which he named after his home of Siskiyou County.\nBrown spider species like Siskiyu armilla are very difficult to tell apart using only their physical characteristics. Many species look similar because they live in the same kind of habitat: under rocks or in other dark, humid places.\nTo make sure the spider Hedin found was genetically different from existing species, he and his colleagues decided to perform a DNA analysis. So he returned to the river to search for a new specimen of the rare spider (and brought his son along with him too).\nCoauthor Rodrigo Monjaraz Ruedas, an assistant curator of entomology at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles who focused on the DNA analysis, was surprised to find that there was such a huge diversity of spider species in the area.\nHe says that if we simply assume that spiders that look similar are the same species without actually examining their DNA, \"we're going to be missing a lot of the actual diversity these spiders have.\"\nCalifornia plays an especially important role in this diversity, according to Monjaraz Ruedas. As part of a project from the California Institute of Biodiversity, which hasn't yet been published, he has found that close to 40% of the total number of described species of spiders in the U.S. can be found in the state.\nHedin, who was once oblivious to the diversity of species his home boasts, says that this journey has brought him full circle: \"Now I know that it's a very unique place.\" He hopes that this discovery shows the other folks living along the river how special their home is.\nAnd \"this is just the tip of the iceberg,\" Monjaraz Ruedas says, because they're still examining 40 to 50 other spiders that might also be new species.\nA smiley snailfish from the deep sea\nNearly 11,000 feet into the deep sea, scientists discovered a new species that caught the attention \u2014 and affection \u2014 of viewers from around the world. The bumpy snailfish was captured on video by researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute during their expedition off the shores of Central California \u2014 and with its big eyes, feathery fins and a mouth bearing the suggestion of a smile, it was an instant hit.\nTo help determine if the floppy pink sea creature was new or one of the 400 existing species of snailfish, they assembled a team of scientists, including Mackenzie Gerringer, an associate professor of biology at the State University of New York at Geneseo.\nEven though Gerringer has \"never met a snailfish [she] didn't love,\" she knows that the deep sea, where some of the species live, is seen as a bit of an alien environment by many people, which can come with a negative connotation.\nShe says the new species can help people question their assumptions about the deep sea because \"you're left with these fishes that are, in my opinion, quite cute, and they really look quite fragile in an environment that we think of as being very harsh.\"\nThe research team also identified two other species of snailfish, which Gerringer says highlights just how much there still is to learn about the deep sea.\nWhile discovering a new species can be very exciting, Gerringer believes the importance of the practice goes beyond that.\n\"It's critical to know who is in these ecosystems, so that we can understand how they're working, so that we can protect habitats like the deep sea that we know play hugely important roles,\" she says. Some of those roles, including the deep sea's ability to store enormous amounts of carbon, are especially important given the threat of climate change.\nLive-birthing toads in Tanzania\nMany people remember learning about the typical life cycle of frogs and toads in elementary school: Eggs turn into tadpoles, which eventually become adults. But scientists have found three new species of toads in Tanzania that do something very unusual: they give birth to live young.\nAnother striking thing about these new species, which are all part of the genus Nectophrynoides: The journey to discover them took over 100 years. The first toad in this genus was described in the early 1900s, and because all the specimens collected looked so similar, they were all thought to belong to a singular species.\nBut Christoph Liedtke, an academic researcher from the Spanish National Research Council who has spent the last decade studying these toads, wondered whether there was more biodiversity in the highlands of the Eastern Arc mountains of Tanzania than previously thought. So he and his colleagues tried to see if there was more than one species in the Nectophrynoides genus.\nThis was no easy task because many of the specimens they needed to examine and compare to modern-day samples were collected before the time of DNA sequencing. Coauthor John Lyakurwa, an assistant lecturer at the University of Dar es Salaam, says that the process was like a \"big puzzle that we had to solve.\"\nSo they teamed up with researchers from Denmark and Belgium to extract DNA from over 200 museum specimens. From there, they used next-generation sequencing to identify three new species in the genus, which was more than previously thought.\nIt's not clear how these toads will fare in the future. Like many species, their populations are in decline, with one species already extinct and others not being spotted for the past 20 years. For his PhD thesis, Lyakurwa has been focusing on understanding why these toad populations have been shrinking. Especially because of their unusual method of reproduction, he stresses that \"if we lose them, we lose a very big evolutionary history.\"",

    "content_clean": "Meet five new species discovered in 2025 Even as some scientists search for signs of life beyond Earth, other researchers have been discovering new species on our own humble planet faster than ever before. From high up in the mountains to the deep sea, take a tour across the world to meet five new species discovered in 2025. An ancient sea cow in the Persian Gulf Cows often get a bad rap for contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, but a newly discovered species of their ocean counterparts suggests that sea cows have been key contributors to a natural climate change solution for the past 21 million years. This long-extinct sea cow's fossil remains were discovered in Al Maszhabiya, Qatar, which is now known to be the richest fossil sea cow deposit in the world. Like today's manatees and dugongs, it mainly grazed on seagrass and was considered an \"ecosystem engineer\" in the coastal waters of the Persian Gulf, where it primarily lived. With their fleshy muzzles, these mammals would browse the seafloor, grab the plants, and use their tusks to snip the roots and eat them. In the process, they lift up nutrients from the seafloor that would otherwise be buried, which other animals in the ecosystem can use. These nutrients, in addition to the sea cow's excrement, help cultivate a healthier and more diverse ecosystem. \"Supporting seagrass communities through ecosystem engineering is a great natural climate solution, because seagrass communities store an incredible amount of carbon,\" says Nicholas Pyenson, curator of fossil marine mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. The name of the new species, Salwasiren qatarensis, honors the fossil's discovery site in Qatar, and the Bay of Salwa in the Persian Gulf, where the largest herd of dugongs can be found today. But Pyenson says Salwa, an Arabic word which roughly translates to \"solace,\" is also a nod to the potential for the new species to \"elevate the visibility and protection of natural heritage,\" adding that \"natural heritage doesn't actually, in all cases, respect geopolitical boundaries.\" Pyenson is referring to the fact that the seagrass meadow in the Bay of Salwa spans the coasts of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. His colleagues are currently in the process of applying for UNESCO World Heritage status to protect the region. \"This is a great example of science diplomacy,\" Pyenson says, \"where data sharing, making data open access and available when you publish, has the potential to actually form a metaphorical bridge between countries that maybe have not historically seen eye to eye.\" You can see a 3D model of the sea cow fossil here. A mini marsupial in the Andes Mountains A beady-eyed mouse opossum living high up in the Peruvian Andes wasn't what Silvia Pavan initially set out to find during her expedition in R\u00edo Abiseo National Park, but the new species gives yet another reason why this special region is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Pavan, an assistant professor at Cal Poly Humboldt, was on the hunt for a specific squirrel species when she and her colleagues came across an animal they eventually named Marmosa chachapoya to honor the Chachapoya people who formerly occupied the area. The tiny marsupial (which, despite its scientific name, is not a marmoset) was the first small mammal that the researchers collected on their trip. While the animal looked a lot like a mouse opossum, its long and delicate snout and home high in the mountains set it apart from other marmosa species. But once Pavan brought the samples back, DNA analysis \u2014 coupled with a close examination of its skull \u2014 proved that this was indeed a new species. The high-altitude area of the mountains where the expedition took place is difficult to access, but Pavan says these underexplored areas are even more important to study: \"We do not know yet completely what we have, and it highlights how much we still need to explore and study the area, and how unique and important [it] is for biodiversity.\" With the threat of climate change and human impact, Pavan says, \"the species are being lost before we know they exist.\" On this trip alone, the team of researchers collected roughly 100 different specimens that they are continuing to identify. An undercover spider in Northern California Marshal Hedin was walking along the river near where he grew up in Northern California when he came across a spider he hadn't seen before. Fifteen years later, the professor of biology at San Diego State University finally got to identify it as a new species of an entirely new genus, which he named after his home of Siskiyou County. Brown spider species like Siskiyu armilla are very difficult to tell apart using only their physical characteristics. Many species look similar because they live in the same kind of habitat: under rocks or in other dark, humid places. To make sure the spider Hedin found was genetically different from existing species, he and his colleagues decided to perform a DNA analysis. So he returned to the river to search for a new specimen of the rare spider (and brought his son along with him too). Coauthor Rodrigo Monjaraz Ruedas, an assistant curator of entomology at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles who focused on the DNA analysis, was surprised to find that there was such a huge diversity of spider species in the area.

Hedin, who was once oblivious to the diversity of species his home boasts, says that this journey has brought him full circle: \"Now I know that it's a very unique place.\" He hopes that this discovery shows the other folks living along the river how special their home is. And \"this is just the tip of the iceberg,\" Monjaraz Ruedas says, because they're still examining 40 to 50 other spiders that might also be new species.

The bumpy snailfish was captured on video by researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute during their expedition off the shores of Central California \u2014 and with its big eyes, feathery fins and a mouth bearing the suggestion of a smile, it was an instant hit. To help determine if the floppy pink sea creature was new or one of the 400 existing species of snailfish, they assembled a team of scientists, including Mackenzie Gerringer, an associate professor of biology at the State University of New York at Geneseo. Even though Gerringer has \"never met a snailfish [she] didn't love,\" she knows that the deep sea, where some of the species live, is seen as a bit of an alien environment by many people, which can come with a negative connotation. She says the new species can help people question their assumptions about the deep sea because \"you're left with these fishes that are, in my opinion, quite cute, and they really look quite fragile in an environment that we think of as being very harsh.\" The research team also identified two other species of snailfish, which Gerringer says highlights just how much there still is to learn about the deep sea. While discovering a new species can be very exciting, Gerringer believes the importance of the practice goes beyond that. \"It's critical to know who is in these ecosystems, so that we can understand how they're working, so that we can protect habitats like the deep sea that we know play hugely important roles,\" she says. Some of those roles, including the deep sea's ability to store enormous amounts of carbon, are especially important given the threat of climate change.

    "body": "Shirley is a 23-year-old self-described \"independent YouTube journalist\" who made prank videos in high school before pivoting to politics. He participated in a White House roundtable in October.",
    "content": "What to know about Nick Shirley, the YouTuber alleging day care fraud in Minnesota\nThe Trump administration is freezing child care funding to the state of Minnesota in response to a viral video that purports to expose extensive fraud by federally funded day care centers.\nNick Shirley, a 23-year-old self-described \"independent YouTube journalist,\" posted the 42-minute video on X and YouTube the day after Christmas.\nIn it, he and an older man \u2014 identified only as \"David\" \u2014 visit various seemingly empty day care centers, bombarding Somali employees with questions and accusing them of not providing services to any children despite receiving public funds. The pair claim to have exposed over $110 million in fraud.\nAllegations of social services fraud in Minnesota have been the subject of federal investigations and mainstream media coverage for years.\nIn one high-profile example, more than 90 individuals have been charged since 2022 in the ongoing case of a Minnesota nonprofit that prosecutors say misappropriated some $250 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds intended to feed children in need, calling it \"the largest Covid-19 fraud scheme in the country.\"\nAnd a federal prosecutor said earlier this month that half or more of the roughly $18 billion in federal funds that supported 14 Minnesota-run programs since 2018 may have been stolen.\nHowever, Shirley's specific allegations have not been verified, with some challenging them in recent days. The manager of one Minnesota day care center has since said Shirley visited outside of its regular hours, while a CNN camera crew interviewing Shirley outside a different center filmed caregivers dropping off their kids in the background (he dismissed them as \"showing face\").\n\"How do I know that [the allegations are] true?\" Shirley responded when asked. \"Well, we showed you guys what was happening, and then you guys can go ahead and make your own analysis.\"\nThe lack of evidence hasn't stopped a number of prominent conservatives \u2014 including Elon Musk and key members of the Trump administration \u2014 from amplifying and acting on Shirley's claims. As of Wednesday, Shirley's video has over 131 million views on X and 2.5 million on YouTube.\nVice President Vance reposted Shirley's video the day after it went live, writing, \"This dude has done far more useful journalism than any of the winners of the 2024 [Pulitzer] prizes.\" (Those prizes went to journalists who covered a range of topics, from billionaires' influence over the Supreme Court to catastrophic flooding in California and missing Black girls and women in Chicago.)\nFBI Director Kash Patel also responded, writing on X that \"even before the public conversation escalated online, the FBI had surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs.\"\nShirley, suddenly in the national spotlight, has expressed concerns about his safety and is asking supporters to donate to his security, including by selling $50 sweatshirts on his website. And he's continued to criticize Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and the mainstream media for their perceived inaction on the issue.\n\"Mainstream media is more mad at me then they are at the FACT that billions of YOUR dollars are being used for fraudulent business,\" Shirley tweeted Wednesday. \"I am not an enemy of the people, they are. I'm with you, they are against you.\"\nShirley started out as a vlogger\nShirley has been making shock-value YouTube videos for years, starting with pranks before wading into political expos\u00e9s.\nThe Utah native vlogged consistently throughout high school, amassing some 7,000 followers before graduating in 2020, according to a profile that year from local NBC affiliate KSL-TV.\n\"Some people might not know who Nick Shirley is yet, but one day, they will,\" it reads.\nOne of his earliest stunts was flying to New York City at age 16 without telling his parents.

    "content_clean": "What to know about Nick Shirley, the YouTuber alleging day care fraud in Minnesota The Trump administration is freezing child care funding to the state of Minnesota in response to a viral video that purports to expose extensive fraud by federally funded day care centers. Nick Shirley, a 23-year-old self-described \"independent YouTube journalist,\" posted the 42-minute video on X and YouTube the day after Christmas. In it, he and an older man \u2014 identified only as \"David\" \u2014 visit various seemingly empty day care centers, bombarding Somali employees with questions and accusing them of not providing services to any children despite receiving public funds. The pair claim to have exposed over $110 million in fraud. Allegations of social services fraud in Minnesota have been the subject of federal investigations and mainstream media coverage for years. In one high-profile example, more than 90 individuals have been charged since 2022 in the ongoing case of a Minnesota nonprofit that prosecutors say misappropriated some $250 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds intended to feed children in need, calling it \"the largest Covid-19 fraud scheme in the country.\" And a federal prosecutor said earlier this month that half or more of the roughly $18 billion in federal funds that supported 14 Minnesota-run programs since 2018 may have been stolen. However, Shirley's specific allegations have not been verified, with some challenging them in recent days. The manager of one Minnesota day care center has since said Shirley visited outside of its regular hours, while a CNN camera crew interviewing Shirley outside a different center filmed caregivers dropping off their kids in the background (he dismissed them as \"showing face\"). \"How do I know that [the allegations are] true?\" Shirley responded when asked. \"Well, we showed you guys what was happening, and then you guys can go ahead and make your own analysis.\" The lack of evidence hasn't stopped a number of prominent conservatives \u2014 including Elon Musk and key members of the Trump administration \u2014 from amplifying and acting on Shirley's claims. As of Wednesday, Shirley's video has over 131 million views on X and 2.5 million on YouTube. Vice President Vance reposted Shirley's video the day after it went live, writing, \"This dude has done far more useful journalism than any of the winners of the 2024 [Pulitzer] prizes.\" (Those prizes went to journalists who covered a range of topics, from billionaires' influence over the Supreme Court to catastrophic flooding in California and missing Black girls and women in Chicago.) FBI Director Kash Patel also responded, writing on X that \"even before the public conversation escalated online, the FBI had surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs.\" Shirley, suddenly in the national spotlight, has expressed concerns about his safety and is asking supporters to donate to his security, including by selling $50 sweatshirts on his website. And he's continued to criticize Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and the mainstream media for their perceived inaction on the issue. \"Mainstream media is more mad at me then they are at the FACT that billions of YOUR dollars are being used for fraudulent business,\" Shirley tweeted Wednesday. \"I am not an enemy of the people, they are. I'm with you, they are against you.\" Shirley started out as a vlogger Shirley has been making shock-value YouTube videos for years, starting with pranks before wading into political expos\u00e9s. The Utah native vlogged consistently throughout high school, amassing some 7,000 followers before graduating in 2020, according to a profile that year from local NBC affiliate KSL-TV. \"Some people might not know who Nick Shirley is yet, but one day, they will,\" it reads. One of his earliest stunts was flying to New York City at age 16 without telling his parents. They escalated from there: sneaking into influencer Jake Paul's wedding, tricking TikTokkers into auditioning for a fake Justin Bieber music video, riding a bike over a ramp lit on fire. He also filmed himself in the crowd outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Then came a hiatus: Shirley announced in December 2021 that he would be taking a two-year break from YouTube to serve on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Santiago, Chile.

Olive, North Carolina.\nSCOTT DETROW, HOST:\nAcross the country, cities and towns are preparing to drop all kinds of objects at midnight to mark the first moments of the New Year. In Lebanon, Pennsylvania, it is giant baloney attached to a disco ball. And that might be a good pairing with Mount Olive, North Carolina. Member station WFAE's Nick de la Canal takes us there as they prepare for tonight's big moment.\nNICK DE LA CANAL, BYLINE: OK, so I'm standing in the Pickle Parlor of downtown Mount Olive, North Carolina, about to see the town's most famous object, the New Year's Eve pickle.\nI'm so excited. Shall we go check it out?\nLYNN WILLIAMS: Sure.\nDE LA CANAL: Lynn Williams is showing me around the pickle-themed gift shop. She's a spokesperson for the Mt. Olive Pickle Company. There are pickle hats, T-shirts, rows of pickle jars and, in the back, resting on a wide shelf...\nWow. OK.\nIt is the big, green plastic pickle the town lowers into a jar every New Year's Eve.\nWILLIAMS: It's about 3 1/2 feet. It's maybe 6 or 8 pounds. It is a sweet petite.\nDE LA CANAL: Now, this pickle is being retired because the company is commissioning a new bigger one for its 100th anniversary this year. And if you're wondering why a town would drop a pickle on New Year's Eve, the answer is baked - or maybe brined - into Mount Olive's history.\nWILLIAMS: In the early 1900s, this was a small little village, a commercial center for a big agricultural area.\nDE LA CANAL: Farmers could grow lots of cucumbers, but there wasn't much demand.\nWILLIAMS: So the businesspeople thought, if you could create a new market for farmers, the whole town would benefit.\nDE LA CANAL: Thus, the Mt. Olive Pickle Company was born in 1926. It grew into one of the town's largest employers and a major source of local pride. In 1999, company executives thought it'd be funny to drop a pickle on New Year's Eve as a marketing stunt. But to locals, it quickly became a really big dill (ph).\nWILLIAMS: And we thought, what a hoot. All these people had the same amount of weird sense of humor that we did, and from then, it's just grown.\nDE LA CANAL: Across the country, many towns and cities drop objects on New Year's Eve tied to local identity. They include a potato in Boise, Idaho, a cheese wedge in Plymouth, Wisconsin, a moon pie in Mobile, Alabama, even a drag queen in a shoe in Key West.\nAMY GROSSMANN: They often reflect regional economies. They point to local labor histories, but they also can celebrate what helped a community survive or thrive.\nDE LA CANAL: Amy Grossmann is with the North Carolina Folklife Society. She says, just look at the orange drop in Miami, representing the state's citrus industry. And then there are seafood drops, like a shrimp in coastal Georgia and a lobster drop in Maine.\nGROSSMANN: They can be a way of saying to people, this is what made us.\nDE LA CANAL: Some drops have even stirred controversy, like in Brasstown, North Carolina, where residents dropped a live possum until pushback from animal rights activists ended the practice in 2019. Tallapoosa, Georgia, still drops a stuffed possum each year. Back in the Mt. Olive Pickle Parlor, shopper Stephen Edwards says he's excited for this year's centennial drop.\nSTEPHEN EDWARDS: If there's one thing that defines this town, it's definitely pickles.\nDE LA CANAL: Beside him, his 9-year-old niece, Ella Edwards, has her own ideas for the centennial pickle.\nELLA EDWARDS: Maybe they cut it open, and there's pickles inside.\nDE LA CANAL: Oh, like a pickle pinata.\nELLA: Yeah.\nDE LA CANAL: For the Mount Olive Chamber of Commerce, this year's drop is a can't-miss event, says its president, Julie Beck.\nJULIE BECK: If you come out that night, you'll have a dill-lightful (ph) time, and you'll try some dill-icious (ph) food, and it's a big dill.\nDE LA CANAL: And she hopes the pickle will usher in a new year that's more sweet than sour.\nFor NPR News, I'm Nick de la Canal in Mount Olive, North Carolina.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NPR.

The city's solution appears successful two years later, but funding for it is set to run out.\nSCOTT DETROW, HOST:\nIn 2023, Phoenix faced a court order to disperse a massive homeless encampment. Part of the city's response was to create a campground downtown for people experiencing homelessness. It's running smoothly, but the future of the site is uncertain as funding begins to dry up. From member station KJZZ, Katherine Davis-Young reports.\nKATHERINE DAVIS-YOUNG, BYLINE: Earlier this year, Michael Travis was living in a Phoenix apartment when his rent increased almost 30%. Pretty soon, he faced the extremely stressful experience of living on the street.\nMICHAEL TRAVIS: It's a different day every day. There's a lot of things that's going on. You got drugs going on out there. You got people dying outside.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: He tried going to a homeless shelter, but he didn't feel much safer inside the crowded, chaotic facility. Then he got a referral to Phoenix's Safe Outdoor Space. It's a four-acre lot downtown with a huge shade structure covering about 200 tents pitched on AstroTurf. Travis has his own tent. He has his dog with him, and he says this is better than being on the street or in a shelter.\nTRAVIS: These security are more thorough in what they do, and the staff as well.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: The site has all the services that indoor shelters have, says Phoenix's Homeless Office director Rachel Milne.\nRACHEL MILNE: So back here, we've got all of our restrooms, hand-washing stations, showers, laundry.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: And even though guests sleep in tents, there's a warehouse in the middle where they can eat meals or escape the elements.\nMILNE: This is what made this site so attractive to us. In addition to all of the shade out there, having a place where people could come inside in the summer or the winter or a monsoon.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: Before this opened in 2023, a downtown homeless encampment had grown so large that neighbors sued and a judge ordered the city to clear the area. Officials wanted to offer shelter to all of the nearly 1,000 people camped there. But Milne says...\nMILNE: We knew pretty quickly that not everyone was going to accept our offer of indoor sites.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: So the city bought this industrial lot nearby to create another alternative. It wasn't the first of its kind. A 2023 study in the journal Urban Geography showed dozens of sites like this across the U.S. took off during the pandemic as homelessness increased, but tight quarters and shelters posed a health risk. But they're often controversial. In Phoenix, neighbors voiced concern that downtown was already burdened with most of the city's homeless services, and some asked why Phoenix would spend millions to house people in tents rather than building more shelters.\nBILL MORLAN: One of my stipulations was that I really thought it needed to be a temporary solution.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: Bill Morlan owns an electric supply business in the neighborhood. He asked city council to only approve the site for three years, allowing time to respond to the homelessness lawsuit but committing to an end date. The council agreed to that three-year limit. Two years in, homelessness continues to increase, and Morlan's feelings have changed. He says the campground hasn't been disruptive and it's still needed.\nMORLAN: I would hope to see them continue to fund it at the levels that it's being funded and continue it.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: Funding could be a challenge. The city has spent more than 6 million a year to operate the site, all of which has come from pandemic-era federal aid so far. Those funds expire in 2026, and Milne says it will be up to the city council to decide what happens to this site after its third year.\nMILNE: Might not look exactly like this a year from now or two years from now.\nDAVIS-YOUNG: But more than 2,000 people have now come through the Safe Outdoor Space. About a third have gone on to treatment, indoor shelter or housing. That's a better success rate than some other shelters, Milne says.

The Trump administration calls this one of its latest America First policies. Rachel Cohen, from the Mountain West News Bureau, reports from a town that was built around park visitors.\nRACHEL COHEN, BYLINE: Gary Hall, the mayor of Estes Park, Colorado, says there's a lot to see and do here.\nGARY HALL: There's a really old 5 and 10 cent-type shop. And that has everything.\nCOHEN: There's the iconic Stanley Hotel and a 90-year-old saltwater taffy shop. But the main attraction is Rocky Mountain National Park. Starting January 1, non-U.S. residents visiting the park will have to pay more than the current $35 per vehicle for a week-long pass, an additional $100 per person. That also applies at parks including Yosemite, the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum explained the change in a social media video.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nDOUG BURGUM: Ensures they contribute their fair share to help preserve and maintain these treasured places.\nCOHEN: Around 14 million international visitors toured national parks in 2018, according to the U.S. Travel Association. In prior years, the U.K., China and Germany were their top home countries. Hall worries the higher fees send them the wrong message.\nHALL: We don't really like you, but if you want to come, you can pay a whole bunch of extra money. I mean, that's what it feels like.\nCOHEN: Mckenzie McMillan thinks the surcharge could backfire. He's with a travel agency called The Travel Group based in Vancouver, Canada.\nMCKENZIE MCMILLAN: International travelers, they're spending significant more money per day in destination than domestic travelers are. So it's perplexing that they would put up a barrier to international visitors.\nCOHEN: But McMillan says the higher park fees aren't top of mind for many of his clients, partly because interest in traveling to the U.S. has already dropped sharply starting, he says, after President Trump's talk of making Canada the 51st state. But Tate Watkins says the fees could help parks. He works for the Property and Environment Research Center, which describes itself as a free-market conservation nonprofit. Watkins says the added revenue could chip away at the billions of dollars in park maintenance backlogs.\nTATE WATKINS: It means that parks have more resources to help serve those people, serve them better and essentially cope with the additional strains that more people inevitably bring.\nCOHEN: A key study Watkins did on Yellowstone earlier this year found that raising fees could bring in $55 million a year and projected they would only decrease visitation by just over 1%. That rings true for Thomas Pemberton, owner of Estes Park Tour Guides. About 1 in 5 of his customers comes from overseas.

    "content_clean": "Non-U.S. citizens will have to pay $100 surcharge to enter some national parks Non-U.S. citizens will have to pay $100 surcharge to enter some national parks Starting Jan. 1, non-U.S. citizens will have to pay an additional $100 each to enter 11 of America's most popular national parks. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Starting tomorrow, international visitors will have to pay more to enter 11 popular national parks. The Trump administration calls this one of its latest America First policies. Rachel Cohen, from the Mountain West News Bureau, reports from a town that was built around park visitors. RACHEL COHEN, BYLINE: Gary Hall, the mayor of Estes Park, Colorado, says there's a lot to see and do here. GARY HALL: There's a really old 5 and 10 cent-type shop. And that has everything. COHEN: There's the iconic Stanley Hotel and a 90-year-old saltwater taffy shop. But the main attraction is Rocky Mountain National Park. Starting January 1, non-U.S. residents visiting the park will have to pay more than the current $35 per vehicle for a week-long pass, an additional $100 per person. That also applies at parks including Yosemite, the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum explained the change in a social media video. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DOUG BURGUM: Ensures they contribute their fair share to help preserve and maintain these treasured places. COHEN: Around 14 million international visitors toured national parks in 2018, according to the U.S. Travel Association. In prior years, the U.K., China and Germany were their top home countries. Hall worries the higher fees send them the wrong message. HALL: We don't really like you, but if you want to come, you can pay a whole bunch of extra money. I mean, that's what it feels like. COHEN: Mckenzie McMillan thinks the surcharge could backfire. He's with a travel agency called The Travel Group based in Vancouver, Canada. MCKENZIE MCMILLAN: International travelers, they're spending significant more money per day in destination than domestic travelers are. So it's perplexing that they would put up a barrier to international visitors. COHEN: But McMillan says the higher park fees aren't top of mind for many of his clients, partly because interest in traveling to the U.S. has already dropped sharply starting, he says, after President Trump's talk of making Canada the 51st state. But Tate Watkins says the fees could help parks. He works for the Property and Environment Research Center, which describes itself as a free-market conservation nonprofit. Watkins says the added revenue could chip away at the billions of dollars in park maintenance backlogs. TATE WATKINS: It means that parks have more resources to help serve those people, serve them better and essentially cope with the additional strains that more people inevitably bring. COHEN: A key study Watkins did on Yellowstone earlier this year found that raising fees could bring in $55 million a year and projected they would only decrease visitation by just over 1%. That rings true for Thomas Pemberton, owner of Estes Park Tour Guides. About 1 in 5 of his customers comes from overseas. He says the surcharge could make the park a less appealing day trip, but he doesn't expect a major hit to his business. THOMAS PEMBERTON: If you can afford a vacation in the States for three weeks, this is a minor, little blip. COHEN: But he's unsure how the new policy will work in practice and how it will be enforced. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINE CLANGING) COHEN: Taffy shop owner Mark Igel packs up holiday orders of pink cinnamon, green peppermint and red-and-white candy cane taffy. He sees the new international fees as just one more hurdle. MARK IGEL: Scheduling a visit to the park, timed entry, construction in Estes Park that every visitor has to deal with in order to come in and spend $20 on a box of taffy.

But now, following the passage of Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill, which puts limits on the food assistance program, it could be harder for them to receive and retain benefits. Stauffer says for her clients, that's not a new challenge. Many don't seek out help due to fear of discrimination or the risk of violence.\nSTAUFFER: They're literally terrified. I know we're here to talk about food, but just even the idea of being flagged as trans is terrifying.\nSMITH: People often have to present identification at food banks and pantries, which could inadvertently out transgender and gender-nonconforming people whose identities may not match the gender on their IDs.

Brad Sears agrees. He's one of the founders of the Williams Institute and studies food insecurity in the LGBTQ+ community. He says there's many reasons beyond just fear of discrimination that LGBTQ+ people are food insecure and less likely to use SNAP than their straight or cisgender peers, such as higher rates of poverty and less of a support system.\nBRAD SEARS: And, you know, the vast majority of people overall and in the LGBT community who rely on SNAP are either disabled, or they're raising young children.\n(CROSSTALK)\nSMITH: Since March 2025, the GLO Center in Springfield has worked with at least 250 individuals and families.

    "content": "Why flu cases are surging this season. And, protests erupt in Iran over the economy\nU.S. Strikes Inside Venezuela, Iran Protests, Flu Cases Surge\nGood morning. You're reading the Up First newsletter. Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.\nToday's top stories\nThe flu season is off to a rough start this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that at least 7.5 million people have been sickened, and more than 3,100 people have died from the flu this season. The surge in cases appears to be driven primarily by a new strain of the virus known as subclade K of influenza A(H3N2), which emerged over the summer in Australia.\n- \ud83c\udfa7 The new strain doesn't seem to be more severe or dangerous than previous ones, NPR's Gabrielle Emanuel tells Up First. Instead, this year's flu vaccine appears to be mismatched against the virus because it was formulated before the strain emerged. Early data from the U.K. show that the vaccine remains effective at preventing hospitalization. Some health experts, however, have raised concerns that the federal government has failed to launch a strong flu vaccination campaign.\nPresident Trump's critics say that a strike on a Venezuelan facility is dragging the U.S. even closer to a more dangerous conflict. This week, the president revealed new details about an attack against a Venezuelan dock allegedly used to load drugs onto boats. The latest operation marks the first known U.S. strike inside Venezuela \u2014 an escalation of Trump's campaign against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government.\n- \ud83c\udfa7 The strike is significant because it raises the risk of killing people who have nothing to do with narcotics trafficking, NPR's Franco Ordo\u00f1ez says. Up until this strike, the U.S. was targeting some sanctioned oil tankers and boats suspected of trafficking drugs. Both of those operations have taken place in international waters.\nIran is experiencing its largest protests in years as thousands of people, unhappy with the state of the economy, flood the streets. Inflation in the country has skyrocketed, and the currency has plummeted to a record low. Public anger is growing over sanctions against the ruling government.\n- \ud83c\udfa7 Months of anger and frustration over water and energy shortages, civil rights abuses and widespread corruption have fueled the current unrest, NPR's Jackie Northam says. These criticisms, combined with the economic protests, have the potential to spiral into something significantly larger. The 12-day war Iran had with Israel over the summer was costly. There is now a widespread belief that Israel will start another conflict with the country, which would add more economic uncertainty, Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, tells Northam.\nLiving better\nLiving Better is a special series about what it takes to stay healthy in America.\nDecember is the busiest time of year for package deliveries and for the porch pirates who steal them. Package theft, however, can happen any time of year. In fact, the security research company SafeWise estimates that thieves steal about 250,000 packages every day. Sometimes, instead of a new iPad, the thief might swipe a mail order of medicine. Here's what you should do about it.\n- \ud83d\udc8a Schedule deliveries for when you are home. Companies such as CVS Caremark offer customers package tracking.\n- \ud83d\udc8a Having a delivery spot that's hidden or even a locker for your porch that doesn't lock can be a good deterrent.\n- \ud83d\udc8a See if you can opt into requiring a signature upon delivery.\n- \ud83d\udc8a Consider getting medicines delivered to a P.O. box.\nPicture show\nAt the Plum Island Museum of Lost Toys & Curiosities, one-time treasures find a new home, bring back memories and warn of the permanence of plastic waste. The collection of items started when the museum's founder, Corinn Flaherty, spotted the head of a 1940s-era doll on a deserted beach in 2015. What began as a \"hot mess\" of stuff in her home evolved into an official museum in Amesbury, Mass., which opened its doors in 2021. The space is a kaleidoscope of color, with carefully curated displays on shelves made from driftwood. Take a look at the artfully arranged items inside the museum.\n3 things to know before you go\n- Tatiana Schlossberg, granddaughter of President John F. Kennedy and daughter of Caroline Kennedy, has died at age 35 following a battle with a rare blood cancer.\n- FIFA President Gianni Infantino on Monday justified the high 2026 World Cup ticket prices by citing an unprecedented demand of over 150 million ticket requests.\n- Many people celebrate the New Year by making resolutions, a concept that dates back centuries. The word \"resolution\" entered English from Latin in the late 14th century, originally meaning to reduce things into simpler forms. Here's how NPR's Word of the Week has evolved into a long-standing tradition.\nThis newsletter was edited by Suzanne Nuyen.",

Today's top stories The flu season is off to a rough start this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that at least 7.5 million people have been sickened, and more than 3,100 people have died from the flu this season. The surge in cases appears to be driven primarily by a new strain of the virus known as subclade K of influenza A(H3N2), which emerged over the summer in Australia. - \ud83c\udfa7 The new strain doesn't seem to be more severe or dangerous than previous ones, NPR's Gabrielle Emanuel tells Up First. Instead, this year's flu vaccine appears to be mismatched against the virus because it was formulated before the strain emerged. Early data from the U.K. show that the vaccine remains effective at preventing hospitalization. Some health experts, however, have raised concerns that the federal government has failed to launch a strong flu vaccination campaign. President Trump's critics say that a strike on a Venezuelan facility is dragging the U.S. even closer to a more dangerous conflict. This week, the president revealed new details about an attack against a Venezuelan dock allegedly used to load drugs onto boats. The latest operation marks the first known U.S. strike inside Venezuela \u2014 an escalation of Trump's campaign against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government. - \ud83c\udfa7 The strike is significant because it raises the risk of killing people who have nothing to do with narcotics trafficking, NPR's Franco Ordo\u00f1ez says. Up until this strike, the U.S. was targeting some sanctioned oil tankers and boats suspected of trafficking drugs. Both of those operations have taken place in international waters. Iran is experiencing its largest protests in years as thousands of people, unhappy with the state of the economy, flood the streets. Inflation in the country has skyrocketed, and the currency has plummeted to a record low. Public anger is growing over sanctions against the ruling government. - \ud83c\udfa7 Months of anger and frustration over water and energy shortages, civil rights abuses and widespread corruption have fueled the current unrest, NPR's Jackie Northam says. These criticisms, combined with the economic protests, have the potential to spiral into something significantly larger. The 12-day war Iran had with Israel over the summer was costly. There is now a widespread belief that Israel will start another conflict with the country, which would add more economic uncertainty, Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, tells Northam.

Package theft, however, can happen any time of year. In fact, the security research company SafeWise estimates that thieves steal about 250,000 packages every day. Sometimes, instead of a new iPad, the thief might swipe a mail order of medicine. Here's what you should do about it. - \ud83d\udc8a Schedule deliveries for when you are home. Companies such as CVS Caremark offer customers package tracking. - \ud83d\udc8a Having a delivery spot that's hidden or even a locker for your porch that doesn't lock can be a good deterrent. - \ud83d\udc8a See if you can opt into requiring a signature upon delivery. - \ud83d\udc8a Consider getting medicines delivered to a P.O. box. Picture show At the Plum Island Museum of Lost Toys & Curiosities, one-time treasures find a new home, bring back memories and warn of the permanence of plastic waste. The collection of items started when the museum's founder, Corinn Flaherty, spotted the head of a 1940s-era doll on a deserted beach in 2015. What began as a \"hot mess\" of stuff in her home evolved into an official museum in Amesbury, Mass., which opened its doors in 2021. The space is a kaleidoscope of color, with carefully curated displays on shelves made from driftwood. Take a look at the artfully arranged items inside the museum. 3 things to know before you go - Tatiana Schlossberg, granddaughter of President John F. Kennedy and daughter of Caroline Kennedy, has died at age 35 following a battle with a rare blood cancer. - FIFA President Gianni Infantino on Monday justified the high 2026 World Cup ticket prices by citing an unprecedented demand of over 150 million ticket requests. - Many people celebrate the New Year by making resolutions, a concept that dates back centuries. The word \"resolution\" entered English from Latin in the late 14th century, originally meaning to reduce things into simpler forms. Here's how NPR's Word of the Week has evolved into a long-standing tradition. This newsletter was edited by Suzanne Nuyen.",

Thousands of people have taken to the streets in several cities across the country to protest the economy.\nA MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST:\nInflation in Iran has skyrocketed, and the country's currency has plummeted to a record low. Anger is growing over sanctions on the country's ruling government, and businesses have closed as many students have joined the demonstrations.\nMARTIN: NPR's international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam has been following these developments, and she's with us now to tell us more about it. Good morning, Jackie.\nJACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.\nMARTIN: So first, could you just describe these protests and what prompted them?\nNORTHAM: What started this round of protests was, as you say, the economy, which is in very bad shape. You know, Iran has struggled under sanctions for more than a decade. And because of that, its oil exports, which are the lifeblood of the country's economy, are sharply curtailed. And so, too, is investment. The local currency, the rial, has plummeted. Inflation is running over 40%. And the government recently published a draft of the budget, which predicted that the real incomes of the salaried middle class will fall by about half. So on top of everything else, that seemed to ignite these protests.\nMARTIN: How is the regime reacting to these protests so far?\nNORTHAM: We're starting to see the security forces crack down. You know, there are videos on social media showing them firing tear gas into the crowd. Also, the authorities today announced a shutdown of government offices, banks, schools, universities across more than 20 provinces, and they said it was due to cold weather. They didn't mention the protests. The country's moderate president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is urging the regime to listen to what he called the legitimate demands of the protesters. As far as the economy, the head of the central bank resigned, and the bank started throwing U.S. dollars into the market to help prop up the rial, which helped a bit, but, you know, it doesn't have unlimited resources to do that.\nI spoke with Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, and he's an economics professor at Virginia Tech specializing in the Iranian economy. And he said another thing is that the 12-day war with Israel this past summer was expensive, and there's a widespread belief now that Israel will start another war, which is smothering investment.\nDJAVAD SALEHI-ISFAHANI: That introduces a kind of uncertainty into an economy that's already very uncertain because of sanctions, because of government policies. So you have kind of a perfect storm now reaching over Iran's economy.\nNORTHAM: The threat of another war grew larger when President Trump said on Monday that the U.S. would back an Israeli attack if Iran appeared to be building up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.\nMARTIN: And given what's going on in Iran right now, is there a sense that this could threaten the regime?\nNORTHAM: The protests haven't reached that point yet, Michel. You know, there was a serious challenge to the regime in 2022 during an uprising after an Iranian woman died in police custody after being arrested for not wearing a headscarf. And those protests lasted for over a month, and more than 500 people were killed, 20,000 people were arrested. You know, we are a long way from that. But there's been anger and frustration for months in Iran over severe water and energy shortages, civil rights abuses and widespread corruption. You add all this on to the protests about the economy, and, you know, there are serious concerns that this could spiral into something much larger.\nMARTIN: And before we let you go, President Trump said on Monday that the U.S. would back an Israeli attack if Iran appeared to be building up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. How has Iran reacted to that?\nNORTHAM: Well, they said they would come down hard. They said that they would retaliate in kind to anything that the U.S. can throw at Iran. You know, at the end of the day, the hope is that there can be some negotiations, but neither side are in the position to start those.\nMARTIN: That is NPR international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam.

To look more closely at what's driving the protests in Iran, we turn to Hooman Majd. He's an Iranian American author and also an NBC contributor. So you're in touch with people in Iran. What have they told you about life under this economy?\nHOOMAN MAJD: Oh, it's horrible. I mean, you know, the best way to describe the past year, at least, is what, you know, the - Queen Elizabeth once called England's annus horribilis, a terrible, terrible year, for Iran. What started out relatively optimistically with Trump taking office and starting negotiations with Iran turned into war in June, which caused a huge depreciation of Iran's currency and uncertainty about the market. And, you know, most imports in Iran are based on the dollar. And when you lose 40% of your purchasing power, it becomes very difficult to maintain a lifestyle that you're accustomed to. I mean, people in Iran are really unhappy more about the economy than anything else.\nSocial freedoms have been relaxed quite a bit since the Women, Life, Freedom protests that were mentioned earlier in 2022. Women now regularly go out without hijab. This is not something that is being - causing concern for people.\nMART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah.\nMAJD: Political freedoms are not really what people are concerned about. It's really the cost of living.\nMART\u00cdNEZ: That James Carville line, right? It's the economy, stupid.\nMAJD: It's the economy, stupid. I mean...\nMART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah.\nMAJD: A quick example is people - a regular person in Iran, doing a regular job - I can't really describe what that would be, whether it's a government official or someone - a barista in a high-end coffee shop, for example, in Tehran, is making less than $100 a month.\nMART\u00cdNEZ: Wow.\nMAJD: And Iran is not a country - at today's exchange rate. And Iran is not a country where the prices of goods are very, very low, like, you know, a desperate third-world country, for example.\nMART\u00cdNEZ: So - but wait. So who do they blame then? I mean, who do the people in Iran blame? The government, sanctions? Who are they blaming?\nMAJD: Well, they definitely will always blame the government, and they'll blame the government for mismanagement and corruption. They'll also blame sanctions. But when you blame sanctions, you can also blame your own government. Why did you not make a deal? Or why did you make a deal that Trump was able to tear up, as Trump said in 2018? I mean, everything went downhill from 2018 economically with the reimposition of sanctions. When the JCPOA, the original nuclear deal under Obama, was signed, there was great optimism in Iran. There was - you know, people were very happy about it. They were happy with their government.\nWhen Trump came to power and came to office and tore up that deal, everything started going downhill. And what happened in January of this year is when Trump took office and said he was going to make a deal, there was optimism. And the rial actually initially went probably, I'd say, 50% higher than it had been because of that optimism. And as we know, Steve Witkoff, Trump's Mideast envoy, was having talks with Iran, with Iranian foreign minister regularly. And in the middle of those talks, Israel attacked.\nMART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah.\nMAJD: So they're blaming - I mean, the people blame everything,\nMART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah, everything.\nMAJD: And they just want a solution - and they want a solution. But, you know, as the report earlier said, this is not yet an Iranian Spring. It's not the Arab Spring. It's not 100,000 people in Tahrir Square.\nMART\u00cdNEZ: So we're not quite there yet. You mentioned Trump, though, and I'm wondering, Hooman, when it comes to President Trump, he's supporting the protesters, but he has not called for regime change. So how much would you say that he factors into what people in Iran are feeling?\nMAJD: Well, I think he definitely factors in because - I mean, he's factored in ever since he's been in office - I think, you know, his support of Israel, his bombing of Iran and what he said just this week with - in the press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that he would support Israel attacking Iran, not just on the nuclear issue, but on the ballistic missiles. And now, that's a big issue for Iran because the ballistic missiles that Iran has, the missiles it was able to use, in the war with Israel is really its only line of defense for the country. So if you're a nationalist Iranian, if you're someone who is proud of your country, regardless of the government, you're going to be very upset about that, and you're going to consider this...\nMART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah.\nMAJD: ...Very threatening and potentially destabilizing Iran even more. So people are very worried right now. I mean, everybody I talk to is extremely worried about the future.\nMART\u00cdNEZ: Hooman Majd, an Iranian American author and NBC contributor. Thank you very much for sharing your thoughts on this.\nMAJD: My pleasure. Thank you.\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. MAJD: ...Very threatening and potentially destabilizing Iran even more. So people are very worried right now. I mean, everybody I talk to is extremely worried about the future. MART\u00cdNEZ: Hooman Majd, an Iranian American author and NBC contributor. Thank you very much for sharing your thoughts on this. MAJD: My pleasure. Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2025 NPR.

Thursday 1 January 2026 01:03, UK Anthony Joshua has been discharged from hospital days after a car crash in Nigeria that killed two of his close friends. The British-Nigerian boxing star is now recovering at his home in the country, according to a statement from the regional governments of Lagos and Ogun states. Joshua was travelling in the back of a black SUV when it hit a stationary truck on a major road near Lagos on Monday, killing his friends Latif Ayodele and Sina Ghami. The 36-year-old two-time world champion and his mother paid their respects to them at a funeral home on Wednesday afternoon ahead of their repatriation to the UK, the statement added. \"Anthony Joshua was discharged from hospital late this afternoon though heavy hearted and full of emotions over the loss of his two close friends he was deemed fit (enough) to recuperate from home,\" the statement, posted on X, read. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free The post also expressed gratitude for the team of doctors and medical staff at the Lagoon Hospital Ikoyi \"that attended to Anthony and those that sustained injuries. \"The quality of care and professionalism is truly commendable.\" Joshua, who was born in Watford to Nigerian parents, was on holiday in Nigeria following his win over Jake Paul in Miami on 19 December. He survived with minor injuries, police have said. Joshua's spokesperson said in a statement Mr Ghami and Mr Ayodele \"were close friends and integral members of Anthony's team\". How did the crash happen? The crash happened on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway near Sagamu, at about midday local time (11am UK time), according to the Nigerian federal road safety corps (FRSC). The FRSC said preliminary findings indicated the Lexus was \"suspected to be travelling beyond the legally prescribed limit\" and \"lost control\" while overtaking before crashing into the truck, which was parked by the side of the road. \"The primary causes of the crash being excessive speed and wrongful overtaking constitute serious traffic violations and remain among the leading causes of fatal road crashes on Nigerian highways,\" the corps said on X. 'Traumatised situation' On Wednesday, a close friend of Joshua told Sky News the boxer would be in a \"traumatised situation\" from seeing another friend die in a car crash, who was more like a \"twin brother\" to him. Kolawole Omoboriowo, who has known Joshua for eight years, was the one to break the news to the athlete's family about the accident. Mr Omoboriowo, who coordinates Joshua's logistics in Nigeria, said the boxer's family were \"like my other family in the UK\". The time since has been a \"crazy nightmare for everyone\", he said.

Thursday 1 January 2026 01:44, UK Snow is expected to fall across much of the UK in a chilly start to 2026, forecasters have said. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for snow and ice across large parts of England and Wales between midnight and noon on 2 January. It could see some areas blanketed in snow up to 5cm deep, especially on higher ground in parts of North Wales and northwest England. Separate yellow warnings are also in place for Northern Ireland between midnight and 10am on Friday, and in northern Scotland between 6am on New Year's Day and the end of Friday. The Met Office said those north of the border could see 10cm-20cm of snowfall, with 30cm possible on the highest routes and hills. Given the strength of the wind, some significant drifting of snow is said to be \"likely\" and lightning \"may well be an additional hazard\". The cold snap is expected to have an impact on transport, with those heading out urged to prepare for longer journey times by road, bus and train. The Met Office has additionally warned of injuries due to slips and falls on icy surfaces, which will develop quickly as sleet and snow clears. The national meteorological service said: \"If you need to make a journey on foot, try to use pavements along main roads which are likely to be less slippery. \"Similarly, if cycling, try and stick to main roads which are more likely to have been treated.\" The new snow and ice warning is in place for a large part of England and Wales, including Chester and Greater Manchester down to London and Kent.

In an unusual response to unrest, the Iranian government on Tuesday offered to set up a dialogue with protest leaders. The first major protests since before June - when US airstrikes prompted an outpouring of patriotism - began on Sunday. Shopkeepers and traders in the capital, Tehran, angry about spiralling inflation and the Iranian currency plunging to a record low against the dollar, took to the streets on Sunday, and have since been joined by students.

Monday's protests were the biggest since 2022, which were prompted by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini in police custody. She was arrested by the country's morality police for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. The recent protests come after the rial lost nearly half its value against the dollar in 2025, with inflation reaching 42.5% in December. On Monday, the governor of Iran's Central Bank, Mohammad Reza Farzin, resigned, replaced by former economics minister Abdolnasser Hemmati.

Wednesday 31 December 2025 15:10, UK Finnish police have seized a cargo vessel suspected of damaging an undersea cable. The Fitburg had departed from Russia and was en route to Israel when Finnish authorities detained the ship. It is suspected of causing damage to a telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia's capital Tallinn belonging to Finnish telecoms group Elisa. \"Finnish authorities have taken control of the vessel as part of a joint operation,\" police said. Fourteen crew members - said to be Russian, Georgian, Kazakh and Azerbaijani - are being held by authorities. Eight NATO states border the Baltic Sea, which also borders Russia. They have been on high alert after a spate of power cable outages, telecoms links and gas pipelines that run along the relatively shallow seabed since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. NATO has boosted its presence in the Baltic with frigates, aircraft and naval drones in recent years. A spokesperson for the military alliance declined to comment on Wednesday's incident. The Fitburg sailed under the flag of St Vincent and the Grenadines, a police spokesperson said. The vessel was dragging its anchor in the sea, and was directed to Finnish territorial waters, the police and Finland's Border Guard stated. \"At this stage, the police are investigating the incident as aggravated criminal damage, attempted aggravated criminal damage, and aggravated interference with telecommunications,\" the police said.

    "content_clean": "European court questions UK decision to revoke Shamima Begum's citizenship The European Court of Human Rights is pressing Britain over the responsibility the state has towards victims of trafficking Wednesday 31 December 2025 18:12, UK A top European court has questioned the UK's revocation of the citizenship of Shamima Begum, after she left the country to join the so-called Islamic State (IS) as a teenage girl. The European Court of Human Rights is pressing Britain over the responsibility of the state towards victims of trafficking, before it revoked her British citizenship. The then 15-year-old schoolgirl from Bethnal Green, east London, travelled to territory held by IS 10 years ago. Shamima Begum was then \"married off\" to an IS fighter and eventually stripped of her British citizenship in 2019, as the government said she posed a threat to national security. Ms Begum remains in a Syrian camp, where her baby son died in 2019 before the citizenship decision. A document published by the European court earlier this month states Ms Begum is challenging the decision under Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits slavery and forced labour. The case was lodged in December last year, after she had been denied the chance to challenge the removal of her British citizenship at the UK's Supreme Court. 'Child lured for sexual exploitation' Among four questions posed by judges in Strasbourg to the Home Office, the court asked: \"Did the Secretary of State have a positive obligation, by virtue of Article 4 of the Convention, to consider whether the applicant had been a victim of trafficking, and whether any duties or obligations to her flowed from that fact, before deciding to deprive her of her citizenship?\" Birnberg Peirce Solicitors, which is representing Ms Begum, said the court's communication presents an \"unprecedented opportunity\" for the UK and Ms Begum to \"grapple with the significant considerations raised in her case and ignored, sidestepped or violated up to now by previous UK administrations\". Lawyer Gareth Peirce said it is \"impossible to dispute that a 15-year-old British child\" was \"lured, encouraged and deceived for the purposes of sexual exploitation to leave home and travel to IS-controlled territory for the known purpose of being given, as a child, to an IS fighter to propagate children for the Islamic State\". She added: \"It is equally impossible not to acknowledge the catalogue of failures to protect a child known for weeks beforehand to be at high risk when a close friend had disappeared to Syria in an identical way and via an identical route. \"It has already been long conceded that the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, who took the precipitous decision in 2019 very publicly to deprive Ms Begum of citizenship, had failed entirely to consider the issues of grooming and trafficking of a school child in London and of the state's consequent duties.\" Ms Peirce, who also represented the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six and the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, added that the government has recently made the protection of victims of grooming and trafficking a national priority. Review called UK an 'outlier' In November, a counterterrorism review called for Shamima Begum and other British-linked people in Syria to be repatriated, calling the UK an \"outlier\" in its policy towards such citizens. But the Home Office, responding to the correspondence from the European court, said any decision made to protect national security would be robustly defended. \"The Government will always protect the UK and its citizens,\" a spokesperson said. \"That is why Shamima Begum - who posed a national security threat - had her British citizenship revoked and is unable to return to the UK. \"We will robustly defend any decision made to protect our national security.\" Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free The Conservatives said Ms Begum should not be allowed back into the UK \"under any circumstances\".

Wednesday 31 December 2025 17:54, UK The UK's flagship stock index has had its best year since 2009 after a series of record-breaking days. The Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 ended the year up 21.5% compared to the start. It means the share price of the publicly traded companies making up the FTSE 100 had the greatest annual increase in 16 years. The FTSE 100 comprises the hundred most valuable companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Notable constituents include lenders such as Barclays, Natwest, HSBC and Lloyds and supermarket chains Tesco, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury's. Read more: Snowfall expected across much of UK as new warnings issued How a healthy diet is helping patients recover from alcohol abuse The index is also largely made up of mining and international oil and gas companies. There was a series of record-breaking moments for the UK's benchmark index across the 12 months, the most recent of which was on 30 December. There were 41 all-time high closes for the FTSE 100 in 2025, according to data from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). Why? It has been boosted by a weak pound at points over the year, which made it good value to buy shares priced in sterling, as FTSE 100 companies tend to be. Many of the mining giants have done well as minerals like gold, silver and copper reached new highs. Investors moved money into the metals as they were perceived as safe investments while markets were volatile. The promise of interest rate cuts by the Bank of England also helped lift the FTSE 100. It had also benefited from investors looking to companies outside of the US after President Trump's trade war against China, and much of the world, began in earnest on 2 April on his so-called Liberation Day. Many trade deals have since been agreed. How does it compare? The UK's top-flight index also outperformed European and US rivals. France's CAC 40 index gained more than 10% in 2025, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 increased nearly 16%. Germany's DAX also rose 21.5%. After a year that saw tech company valuations soar, as investors sought to benefit from an anticipated artificial intelligence (AI) boom, Wall Street's S&P 500 rose 17%.

All matches are being broadcast in the UK on either Channel 4, 4seven, All 4 or Channel 4 Sport YouTube. Which Premier League players are at Afcon? Arguably the biggest name in African football, Mohamed Salah has linked up with the Egypt squad after a turbulent few weeks with Liverpool. No other players have left Anfield for the tournament, giving the club a look at what life after Salah may be like. Manchester City\u2019s Omar Marmoush joins him with Egypt, having struggled for minutes after a knee injury in September. City will hope that Afcon can turn last season\u2019s flashes of brilliance into consistent performances. Some fanbases will be relieved not to lose key players. Newcastle United supporters will hope Yoane Wissa can kickstart his career on Tyneside after he was left out of DR Congo\u2019s squad. Antoine Semenyo\u2019s Ghana did not qualify, allowing Bournemouth to keep hold of their top scorer but also clearing the way for immediate transfer business as the window opens. He will be in action against England at the World Cup.",

This means Matthew Potts is likely to come into England\u2019s attack in Sydney, with Surrey\u2019s Matthew Fisher the only other possibility. They have opted not to call up another bowler, meaning their squad is now just 14 strong.

    "content_clean": "Scotland rings in new year as weather warning kicks off 2026 Scotland has welcomed the new year in spectacular fashion \u2013 but some people are already battening down the hatches with snow and ice forecast across much of the country. The weather didn't chill the sprits of revellers at Edinburgh's famous street party as organisers estimated tens of thousands of people attended the world-famous event next to Edinburgh Castle. Heavy snow and ice is expected everywhere north of Dundee from 06:00 on New Year's Day until midnight on Sunday, with a yellow weather warning in place. Another warning for gale-force winds has taken effect across Orkney and Shetland. The snow is expected to affect north and north-east Scotland, the Northern Isles, Hebrides, Angus, Perth and Kinross and parts of Argyll and Bute. Network Rail has warned that train lines in the north of Scotland could be impacted by snow and urged people to check their journey ahead of time. Northlink Ferries has warned that some services may be disrupted from Friday to Sunday. Scottish & Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) says it has activated contingency plans, with teams ready to respond to any network damage caused by the weather. Tens of thousands of revellers descended on Edinburgh's famous Princes Street party which culminated in the traditional firework display above Edinburgh Castle at midnight. More in World Organisers saved money this year as they used some of the fireworks bought for last year's event which was cancelled. The event fell victim to bad weather for the third time since 2003, leaving 45,000 revellers to make alternative plans to see in the new year. Unique Assembly's artistic director William Burdett-Coutts said: \"I think last year was one of the most depressing moments I've been through, when we had to call it off. \"So it's fantastic to be back and the public have totally embraced it. There's lots of people turning out this evening. I think we're up to about 45,000 so far for the street party. \"The concert will be going on for most of the evening, and it should be a fantastic night. It will be an amazing party.\" Indie rock band Wet Leg headlined the Concert in the Gardens. There was also performances by Scottish support acts Hamish Hawk and Lucia & The Best Boys. Will Evans, director of Titanium Fireworks, told BBC Scotland News the midnight fireworks featured about 10,000 fireworks, accompanied by a bespoke soundtrack during a six-minute show. A temporary airspace restriction will be in place covering Edinburgh city centre between 18:00 on Hogmanay and 02:00 on New Year's Day. It will be an offence for any unmanned aircraft to fly below 2,000ft above sea level within one nautical mile of Edinburgh Castle. The restrictions include drones. Elsewhere, Stonehaven's Hogmanay fireballs event went ahead despite the weather, with about 10,000 people in attendance. It involves about 40 men and women parading up and down the High Street swinging flaming balls around their heads before the balls are thrown into the harbour. However the annual Nippy Dip in Stonehaven on New Year's Day has been cancelled due to safety fears. Hundreds of people will be taking part in the 40th New Year's Day Loony Dook at South Queensferry. The brave swimmers will be donning fancy dress to take a dip in the freezing waters of the Firth of Forth. The dook, a Scots word meaning to dip or plunge, began on 1 January 1987 when a group of friends went for a swim in the icy water as a hangover cure. Edinburgh's annual torchlight procession kicked off the Hogmanay celebrations on Monday night when thousands of people marched through the Meadows waving flaming torches, making their way to Edinburgh Castle. Organisers said about 15,000 people took part, with a further 10,000 spectators. Forecast details A yellow weather warning for heavy wind came into force at 21:00, and snow and ice is expected from 06:00 on New Year's Day until midnight on Sunday. The Met Office said there could be up to two inches (5cm) of snow at low levels by Friday, with four inches (10cm) in some places. Up to eight inches (20cm) of snow could accumulate on higher ground, with as much as 12 inches (30cm) on the hills. There is a warning of \"significant\" drifting of snow due to the high winds. The Met Office said lightning could be an additional hazard and added that it was likely that frequent and heavy snow showers would disrupt travel.",

    "headline": "Trump administration terminates lease for Washington's 3 public golf courses",
    "body": "",
    "content": "Trump administration terminates lease for Washington's 3 public golf courses\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration has ended the lease agreement for three public golf courses in Washington, a move that offers President Donald Trump an additional opportunity to put his stamp on another piece of the nation's capital.\nThe National Links Trust, the nonprofit that has operated Washington's three public courses on federal land for the last five years, said Wednesday that the Department of the Interior had terminated its 50-year lease agreement. The Interior Department said it was terminating the lease because the nonprofit had not implemented required capital improvements and failed to meet the terms of the lease.\nWhile it was unclear what the Trump administration's plans are for the golf courses, the move gives Trump, whose private company has developed numerous golf courses in the U.S. and abroad, the chance to remake links overlooking the Potomac River and in Rock Creek Park and a site that is part of Black golf history.\nOfficials for the National Links Trust said in a statement that they were \u201cdevastated\u201d by the decision to terminate the lease and defended their management of the courses.

    "content_clean": "Trump administration terminates lease for Washington's 3 public golf courses WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration has ended the lease agreement for three public golf courses in Washington, a move that offers President Donald Trump an additional opportunity to put his stamp on another piece of the nation's capital. The National Links Trust, the nonprofit that has operated Washington's three public courses on federal land for the last five years, said Wednesday that the Department of the Interior had terminated its 50-year lease agreement. The Interior Department said it was terminating the lease because the nonprofit had not implemented required capital improvements and failed to meet the terms of the lease. While it was unclear what the Trump administration's plans are for the golf courses, the move gives Trump, whose private company has developed numerous golf courses in the U.S. and abroad, the chance to remake links overlooking the Potomac River and in Rock Creek Park and a site that is part of Black golf history. Officials for the National Links Trust said in a statement that they were \u201cdevastated\u201d by the decision to terminate the lease and defended their management of the courses. They said $8.5 million had gone toward capital improvements at the courses and that rounds played and revenue had more than doubled in their tenure managing the courses. The nonprofit has agreed to keep managing the courses for the time being, but long-term renovations will stop. \u201cWhile this termination is a major setback, we remain stubbornly hopeful that a path forward can be found that preserves affordable and accessible public golf in the nation\u2019s capital for generations to come,\u201d the officials added. The Department of the Interior's decision comes as Trump rebrands civic spaces in Washington and deploys National Guard members to the streets for public safety.

With 71 percent of the Earth\u2019s surface covered by water, this expansive ecosystem has been difficult to study, and many animals of the deep ocean remain a complete mystery. One of the most spellbinding of these animals is the colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni). When full-grown, this creature is about as long as a bus and weighs nearly 1,100 pounds.\nBelieved to live in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, this immense cephalopod\u2014the largest invertebrate species on the planet\u2014 has never been observed in its natural habitat. Scientists only get a good look at these animals when trawlers accidentally catch them in their nets. But a new kind of oceanographic study seems to have struck gold last year when international research team and non-profit called Kolossal appeared to have stumbled across a juvenile colossal squid during one of its four trips to Antarctica from December 2022 to March 2023.\nThe team used a novel approach for imaging the ocean\u2014outfitting a polar tourism vessel called the Ocean Endeavor with a deep-sea camera. Thankfully, the research team released the footage, which the website IFLScience promptly posted to YouTube.\n\u201cAntarctica is experiencing rapid and complex change, and it is critical to have a better understanding of these changes for the region\u2019s ocean ecosystems,\u201d the Kolossal team wrote in a paper detailing the method in 2024. \u201cThe costs and logistical challenges to operate scientific research vessels prohibits the scaling of crucial science and discovery in the region.

Even the short clip of the above specimen isn\u2019t confirmed, as the video could be capturing an adult glass squid Galiteuthis glacialis or perhaps even a species completely unknown to science. The video is being peer-reviewed by experts, but it\u2019s unlikely that scientists will ever know for sure. But because footage of any squid species in the Southern Ocean is rare, the footage is a huge victory for marine biologists studying these famously elusive animals regardless of its contents.\n\u201cThe two known Cranchiidae taxa seen in the Antarctic are Galiteuthis glacialis and Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni,\u201d Aaron Evans, who is peer reviewing the footage, told IFLScience. \u201cThe squid seen here could belong to different life stages of either of those taxa\u2014and is an exciting example of wild cranchiid behavior, as I cannot think of existing video footage of either of those squid in their natural environment.\u201d\nAlthough the team\u2019s stated goal is to capture footage of an adult colossal squid in its natural environment, according to IFLScience, the camera filmed nearly 80 species.

Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush \u2014 a role that is akin to being the general manager of the residence.\n\u201cAll the presidents that I had an opportunity to serve always talked about some possibility of an enlarged area\u201d for entertaining, Walters said in an interview with The Associated Press about his recently published memoir.\nTrump has been talking about building a White House ballroom for years, even before he entered the political arena. In July, the White House announced a 90,000-square-foot space would be built on the east side of the complex to accommodate 650 seated guests at a then-estimated cost of $200 million. Trump has said it will be paid for with private donations, including from him.\nThe Republican president later upped the proposed ballroom\u2019s capacity to 999 people and, by October, had demolished the two-story East Wing of the White House to build it there. In December, he updated the price tag to $400 million \u2014 double the original estimate.\nImages of the East Wing being demolished shocked historians, preservationists and others, but Walters said there is a long history of projects on the campus, ranging from conservatories, greenhouses and stables being torn down to build the West Wing in 1902, to the expansion of the residence with a third floor, to the addition of the East Wing itself during World War II to provide workspace for the first lady, her staff and other White House offices.\n\u201cSo there's always been construction going on around the White House,\u201d Walters said.\nOther presidents bemoaned the lack of space for entertaining\nWhen Walters was on the job, the capacity of the largest public rooms in the White House was among the first topics he discussed with the incoming president, first lady and their social secretary, he said. The presidents he served all talked about the limited number of people the White House could handle.\nWhen set up for a state dinner, the State Dining Room can hold about 130 people: 13 round tables each with seating for 10, Walters said. The East Room can accommodate about 300 chairs \u2014 fewer if space is needed for television cameras.\nTrump complains often that both rooms are too small. He also has complained about the use of large tents on the south grounds, the main workaround for big events such as ritzy state dinners for foreign leaders. Walters said the tents had issues.\n\u201cWhen it rained, the water flows downhill and the grass became soggy, no matter what we tried to do,\u201d Walters said. \u201cWe dug culverts around the outside of the tent to try and get the water.\" Tents damaged the grass, requiring more work to reseed it, he said.\nMore in Politics\nWalters admitted it was a bit jarring to see the East Wing torn down, and said he had fond personal memories of the space. \u201cI met my wife at the White House and she worked in the East Wing, so that was a joy for me,\u201d said Walters, 79.\nHis wife, Barbara, was a receptionist in the visitors office during the administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.

    "content": "US Auto Dealers Drags Scout Motors to Court Because It Is Selling Cars Directly to Customers\nThis has to be one of the most charged debates in the U.S. auto industry this year. Scout Motors\u2019 decision to sell cars directly to customers triggered fierce backlash from franchise dealers, highlighting long-simmering tensions between traditional retail networks and emerging direct-to-consumer business models.\nThe clash sharpened in Colorado, where the state Motor Vehicle Dealer Board\u2019s decision to grant Scout a dealer license unsettled established dealers, while raising broader questions about the future of auto retailing.\nA New Sales Model Meets Old-Guard Resistance\nScout Motors is a Volkswagen Group-backed EV brand. The company deliberately pursued a sales approach more commonly associated with Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid.\nUnlike conventional manufacturers that rely on independent franchise dealers to sell and service vehicles, Scout intends to manage everything from reservations to delivery through its own facilities and online platform. That model promises transparent pricing, streamlined transactions, and a more controlled experience for customers.\nBut dealers see a threat to the industry\u2019s longstanding franchise system, which they argue has underpinned local economies, provided guaranteed service networks, and protected consumers.\nOn a recent episode of Inside Automotive, industry veteran Mike Maroone, CEO of Mike Maroone Auto and former AutoNation executive, described Colorado\u2019s regulatory approval as a \u201ccircumvention of the traditional franchise system\u201d that undermines dealer investments and protections established over decades.\nHe dismissed Scout\u2019s claims of operating separately from its corporate parent, Volkswagen, using a familiar saying to make his point: \u201cIf it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it\u2019s a duck.\u201d\nMaroone\u2019s critique reflects a fundamental dispute about corporate structure and brand identity. Scout insists that it is a distinct brand with its own business model, but dealers counter that financial backing from Volkswagen and deep operational ties make that distinction superficial. They argue that allowing a manufacturer-backed brand to bypass the dealer network sets a worrying precedent that could unravel protections franchisees rely on.\nAn Existential Battle for the Franchise System\nThe Colorado decision is especially significant because the state boasts one of the strongest electric vehicle markets in the country, with roughly 27 percent of all vehicle sales being electric. Federal and state incentives have helped fuel demand, though shifts in incentive structures have recently moderated growth. Even in a strong market, dealers feel pressured as new direct sales approaches gain regulatory footholds.\nMaroone has proposed that dealers consider a multipronged response that could include litigation, negotiation, and political advocacy. He underscored the value of dealer associations in unifying opposition and leveraging political capital to defend the status quo. In his view, the threat is existential rather than theoretical, with manufacturer-owned direct sales potentially eroding the economic foundations of independent dealers.\nThe friction goes beyond Colorado. Dealer groups nationwide, including the National Automobile Dealers Association, have pledged to challenge Scout\u2019s direct-to-consumer strategy in courts and statehouses across the country. These challenges echo earlier disputes over Tesla and other electric vehicle makers that have similarly eschewed franchise networks, testing state franchise laws that were drafted long before internet-based sales were possible.\nIn some states, dealers have already escalated their opposition into litigation. For example, in Florida, Volkswagen and Audi dealers filed a lawsuit claiming Scout\u2019s direct sales violated state law by accepting deposits for vehicles not yet in production. They contended that taking deposits constituted sales under state definitions and sought injunctions to halt the practice. The dispute underscored how legal interpretations of sales activity vary widely across states.\nA Battle Over the Future of Car Buying\nScout\u2019s supporters argue that the direct model aligns with evolving consumer expectations shaped by online retail and digital services. They contend that eliminating intermediaries can reduce friction and cost while offering buyers a more transparent experience. Scout\u2019s leadership has expressed optimism about consumer demand for its Terra pickup and Traveler SUV, even as dealer pushback grows.\nAt its core, the conflict encapsulates a broader industry transformation. Traditional dealers emphasize their local economic impact and service capacity. Direct-to-consumer proponents highlight efficiency and modern customer engagement. As Scout and similar brands expand, the legal, economic, and political wrangling will likely continue, shaping how Americans buy vehicles in the decades ahead.",

Thick clouds of dust rose over the camp as residents watched from a distance, according to an AFP news agency journalist at the scene.\n\u201cBeing torn away from our homes, our neighbourhoods and our memories is deeply painful,\u201d said Mutaz Mahr, whose building was among those destroyed.\n\u201cThe occupation tries by every means to wear us down and pressure us,\u201d he told AFP, referring to Israel.\n\u201cOur home is dear to us, the memories are dear to us, the family, the neighbours, and the good people are dear to us,\u201d he said as bulldozers advanced. \u201cThe first time, our grandparents were displaced, and this is the second time.\u201d\nMahr said he and about 25 relatives were sheltering in a 100-square-metre (120-square-yard) apartment after being driven out of the camp.\nThe Israeli military claimed the demolitions formed part of an operation against Palestinian resistance groups, a claim that could not be independently verified. Palestinian residents and rights groups say the destruction amounts to collective punishment and forced displacement under occupation.\nNihaya al-Jendi, a member of Nur Shams\u2019s popular committee, said the scale of displacement had already reached crisis levels before the latest raid.\n\u201cToday, more than 1,500 families from the camp are still unable to return,\u201d Jendi told AFP. \u201cThis is a major catastrophe \u2013 a real humanitarian disaster for Palestinian refugees \u2013 unfolding before the eyes of the world.\u201d\nIsrael launched what it calls a security operation earlier this year targeting refugee camps in the northern West Bank, including Nur Shams, Tulkarem and Jenin.\nAt least 850 homes have been demolished or severely damaged across the three camps, according to Human Rights Watch, which analysed satellite imagery.

That policy was reversed in March 2024 when Israel\u2019s parliament repealed the disengagement law through legislation known as the \u201cCancellation of the Disengagement Law\u201d.\nChannel 7 said the new plan could take effect within two months.\nIsraeli moves against the UN\nThe demolitions and settlement approvals come as Israel escalates pressure on the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned an Israeli move to cut electricity or water to facilities owned by UNRWA, his spokesperson said on Wednesday.\nThe measure would \u201cfurther impede\u201d the agency\u2019s ability to function, the spokesperson added. \u201cThe Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations remains applicable to UNRWA, its property and assets,\u201d said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, stressing that UNRWA is an \u201cintegral\u201d part of the UN system.\nUNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini denounced the decision as part of a \u201csystematic campaign to discredit UNRWA and thereby obstruct\u201d its work supporting Palestinian refugees.\nIn 2024, Israel\u2019s parliament passed a law banning the agency from operating in the country and barring officials from contact with it.

In the eastern city of Leipzig, where riots broke out in previous years, police and first responders were attacked with fireworks.\nIn the western city of Bielefeld, two 18-year-old men died after suffering fatal facial injuries in separate accidents involving homemade fireworks.\nBerlin welcomed 2026 with a seven-and-a-half-minute fireworks display at the Brandenburg Gate and countless private fireworks. The capital's traditional New Year's Eve party featuring live performances was cancelled after the city government said it would no longer fund it, and was replaced with a DJ party at the Berlin landmark.\nMeanwhile in Hamburg, thousands of people welcomed in 2026 at public broadcaster ZDF's New Year's Eve show in rainy weather. For the first time, the \"Silvester in Concert\" show did not take place in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin but on a floating stage on the Elbe in front of the Westfield shopping centre.\nAt midnight, there was a spectacular fireworks display, which was set off by tugs behind the stage.\nIn Hamburg, organizers said that around 10,000 people celebrated the arrival of 2026 at a large New Year's Eve party on Ludwigstra\u00dfe. Everything was very peaceful, said Katrin Strauch from event agency Gral. \"There were no incidents, nothing at all.\"\nThose who welcomed the New Year outside were best advised to dress warmly. In parts of Germany, the German Weather Service advised caution due to snow and slippery conditions. In the north, it was expected to become increasingly stormy on Thursday morning.\nBerlin New Year's celebrations calmer than in past\nBerlin Police spokesman Florian Nath told dpa in a preliminary assessment that, as of 3 am, police had \"no reports of serious injuries among our colleagues or among revellers. Nor did we have any serious incidents or property damage like last year.\"\nPolice officers were however attacked with fireworks, 21 of them suffering minor injuries.\nMore in U.S.\nThe police were partially successful in countering the dynamics of criminal perpetrators who moved among the crowd of peaceful revellers. The concept of a large firework-free zone worked particularly well at Alexanderplatz.\nThe demonstration and party at the Victory Column were peaceful. Instead of the 16,000 participants who had registered, only a few hundred showed up, according to the spokesperson. The celebration at the Brandenburg Gate, which attracted many thousands of visitors, also passed without incident.\nPolice in Leipzig attacked with fireworks\nIn Leipzig, police and emergency services were attacked with fireworks, according to a police spokesperson. Among other measures, the police erected barriers in the Connewitz district, which is known for riots.\nHowever, the incidents and fires in Leipzig were not limited to the known areas; there were also several fires in Leipzig city centre, where rubbish bins were set alight.\nIn recent years, there have been regular riots in Leipzig on New Year's Eve. Even before the turn of the year, police warned that it was not only the Connewitz district that could be affected.\nFire brigades constantly at work\nThere were also incidents in Hamburg during the night: according to police, passers-by and emergency services were pelted with fireworks in the Steilshoop district. No injuries were initially reported. Suspected perpetrators were identified, but it was initially unclear whether they had been arrested.\nFire brigades are also in constant action: fires were reported in several federal states during the night. Roof trusses were on fire, as were rubbish bins, hedges and cars. An initial assessment was not expected until New Year's Day.\nDiscussion of firework ban\nThis year, as in the past, many groups, from health professionals to environmentalists, called for a ban on fireworks in the run-up to New Year's Eve.\nDoctors' representatives, police officers and animal rights activists all suggested a general ban on the use of private firecrackers and rockets due to the number of injuries caused.",

    "content": "Fraud claims, wine money, Sharia: Ethical storms around Ilhan Omar\u2019s husband\nThe legal battles facing Tim Mynett have reignited questions regarding the alignment of his business ventures with the strict Islamic values Congresswoman Omar champions.\nA fresh wave of legal challenges facing Tim Mynett, the husband of US RepresentativeIlhan Omar (D-MN), has brought renewed scrutiny to the couple. This attention focuses not only on business ethics but also on the apparent contradictions between Mynett\u2019s commercial interests and the religious identity central to Omar\u2019s public persona.\nMynett, a political consultant turned venture capitalist, is currently the subject of a lawsuit alleging fraud and breach of contract in connection with \"eStCru,\" a California-based wine business in which he is a partner.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Washington, DC, claims that Mynett and his business partner, Will Hailer, defrauded investor Naeem Mohd.

    "content_clean": "Fraud claims, wine money, Sharia: Ethical storms around Ilhan Omar\u2019s husband The legal battles facing Tim Mynett have reignited questions regarding the alignment of his business ventures with the strict Islamic values Congresswoman Omar champions. A fresh wave of legal challenges facing Tim Mynett, the husband of US RepresentativeIlhan Omar (D-MN), has brought renewed scrutiny to the couple. This attention focuses not only on business ethics but also on the apparent contradictions between Mynett\u2019s commercial interests and the religious identity central to Omar\u2019s public persona. Mynett, a political consultant turned venture capitalist, is currently the subject of a lawsuit alleging fraud and breach of contract in connection with \"eStCru,\" a California-based wine business in which he is a partner. The lawsuit, filed in Washington, DC, claims that Mynett and his business partner, Will Hailer, defrauded investor Naeem Mohd. According to court documents, Mohd alleges he was persuaded to invest $300,000 based on a guarantee of a 200% return within 18 months, but the plaintiff's promises were never fulfilled.

    "content": "New year, new mayor: New York rings in 2026 with Zohran Mamadani's inauguration\nMamdani was a trailblazing candidate and is expected by many in his city of 8 million - some with hope, some with trepidation - to be a disruptive mayor.\nZohran Mamdani was sworn in as New York City mayor in the first minutes of the New Year at the historic City Hall subway station, with his wife Rama Duwaji standing by his side.\nThe oath, in which he pledged to support the Constitution of the United States and the laws of New York, was administered by New York State Attorney General Letitia James.\n\"Happy New Year to New Yorkers, both inside this tunnel and above,\" said Mamdani, standing beneath a vaulted ceiling with the words City Hall over his head. \"This is truly an honor and a privilege of a lifetime.\"\nMamdani was a trailblazing candidate and is expected by many in his city of 8 million - some with hope, some with trepidation - to be a disruptive mayor.\nThe democratic socialist's plans for his first day in office on Thursday reflect his politics and priorities, without straying far from his predecessors: a sober official midnight oath-taking followed by a more celebratory ceremony in the afternoon.\nNew York law states that four-year mayoral terms begin on January 1 following the election. To avoid any ambiguity about who's in charge of America's most populous city, it has become a tradition to hold a small swearing-in just after midnight.\nMamdani chose the Old City Hall subway stop, which was decommissioned in the middle of the previous century and is accessible only a few times a year through guided tours, as the site of his swearing in.\nThe subway site, according to Mamdani\u2019s transition team, reflects his \"commitment to the working people who keep our city running every day.\"\nMamdani, a 34-year-old former state lawmaker, promised a rent freeze and free buses and childcare, building a campaign around affordability issues that some have seen as a path forward for his Democratic Party nationwide ahead of midterm elections.\nMamdani inspired a record-breaking turnout of more than 2 million voters and won 50 percent, nearly 10 points ahead of Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, and well ahead of Republican Curtis Sliwa.\nAttorney General James was among his earliest prominent backers. During President Donald Trump's first administration, James began investigating his business practices in New York, and in 2024, a judge found that Trump fraudulently overstated his net worth to deceive lenders.\nMore in U.S.\nThe Trump administration has targeted James during his second term, accusing her of mortgage fraud.\nGrant Reeher, a Syracuse University political science professor, said James's role in the inauguration would send a message to core supporters that Mamdani is \"going to be independent of the president.\u201d\nNew York City's first Muslim mayor\nThe Uganda-born Mamdani, who will be New York City's first Muslim mayor, has been a sharp critic of Trump on issues such as immigration and said his differences with the president were numerous after a warm White House meeting.\nBut being sworn in by the state attorney general may say more about Mamdani's political alliances than rivalries. In 2014, Bill de Blasio, whom Mamdani regards as the best New York City mayor of his lifetime, was sworn in privately by then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman at the start of the first of his two terms.\nSenator Bernie Sanders, a progressive Brooklyn-born Vermont senator whom Mamdani calls his inspiration, presided over de Blasio's 2018 public inauguration and will play a similar role for Mamdani. Liberal Democratic US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is also on the agenda for the inauguration ceremony.\nPlans for Mamdani's public inauguration include a ceremony on City Hall's steps and a program of music and speeches for 4,000 guests in City Hall Plaza. In addition, tens of thousands of people will be able to watch a livestream of what Mamdani's team has dubbed the \u201cInauguration of a New Era\u201d in free viewing areas set up along Broadway.\nMamdani raised $2.6 million for the transition and celebrations from nearly 30,000 contributors, more than other mayors on record this century, both in total and in single donations, according to official campaign data that presents disclosures of inaugural expenses beginning with Michael Bloomberg's first term in 2001.\nSami Zaman, the owner of Astoria's low-key Afghan restaurant Sami's Kabab House, where Astoria resident Mamdani filmed a campaign video with Sanders, was on the inaugural committee alongside filmmakers, writers, and activists.\nAfter becoming mayor, Mamdani will move from his one-bedroom Astoria apartment, protected from sharp price hikes by the city rent-stabilization program, to Gracie Mansion, the official residence of New York City mayors on Manhattan's upscale Upper East Side.\nBankers and others in New York, the nation's financial capital, had expressed concern about Mamdani, but since his election, many have explored how to work with him.\nThe city has had another mayor associated with democratic socialism, David Dinkins. Dinkins did not make much of his association with the Democratic Socialists of America. During his 1990-1993 term, he overcame budget deficits and persuaded private businesses to remain in New York, according to city archivists.",

Zohran Mamdani was sworn in as New York City mayor in the first minutes of the New Year at the historic City Hall subway station, with his wife Rama Duwaji standing by his side. The oath, in which he pledged to support the Constitution of the United States and the laws of New York, was administered by New York State Attorney General Letitia James. \"Happy New Year to New Yorkers, both inside this tunnel and above,\" said Mamdani, standing beneath a vaulted ceiling with the words City Hall over his head. \"This is truly an honor and a privilege of a lifetime.\" Mamdani was a trailblazing candidate and is expected by many in his city of 8 million - some with hope, some with trepidation - to be a disruptive mayor. The democratic socialist's plans for his first day in office on Thursday reflect his politics and priorities, without straying far from his predecessors: a sober official midnight oath-taking followed by a more celebratory ceremony in the afternoon. New York law states that four-year mayoral terms begin on January 1 following the election. To avoid any ambiguity about who's in charge of America's most populous city, it has become a tradition to hold a small swearing-in just after midnight. Mamdani chose the Old City Hall subway stop, which was decommissioned in the middle of the previous century and is accessible only a few times a year through guided tours, as the site of his swearing in. The subway site, according to Mamdani\u2019s transition team, reflects his \"commitment to the working people who keep our city running every day.\" Mamdani, a 34-year-old former state lawmaker, promised a rent freeze and free buses and childcare, building a campaign around affordability issues that some have seen as a path forward for his Democratic Party nationwide ahead of midterm elections. Mamdani inspired a record-breaking turnout of more than 2 million voters and won 50 percent, nearly 10 points ahead of Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, and well ahead of Republican Curtis Sliwa. Attorney General James was among his earliest prominent backers. During President Donald Trump's first administration, James began investigating his business practices in New York, and in 2024, a judge found that Trump fraudulently overstated his net worth to deceive lenders. More in U.S. The Trump administration has targeted James during his second term, accusing her of mortgage fraud. Grant Reeher, a Syracuse University political science professor, said James's role in the inauguration would send a message to core supporters that Mamdani is \"going to be independent of the president.\u201d New York City's first Muslim mayor The Uganda-born Mamdani, who will be New York City's first Muslim mayor, has been a sharp critic of Trump on issues such as immigration and said his differences with the president were numerous after a warm White House meeting. But being sworn in by the state attorney general may say more about Mamdani's political alliances than rivalries. In 2014, Bill de Blasio, whom Mamdani regards as the best New York City mayor of his lifetime, was sworn in privately by then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman at the start of the first of his two terms. Senator Bernie Sanders, a progressive Brooklyn-born Vermont senator whom Mamdani calls his inspiration, presided over de Blasio's 2018 public inauguration and will play a similar role for Mamdani. Liberal Democratic US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is also on the agenda for the inauguration ceremony. Plans for Mamdani's public inauguration include a ceremony on City Hall's steps and a program of music and speeches for 4,000 guests in City Hall Plaza. In addition, tens of thousands of people will be able to watch a livestream of what Mamdani's team has dubbed the \u201cInauguration of a New Era\u201d in free viewing areas set up along Broadway. Mamdani raised $2.6 million for the transition and celebrations from nearly 30,000 contributors, more than other mayors on record this century, both in total and in single donations, according to official campaign data that presents disclosures of inaugural expenses beginning with Michael Bloomberg's first term in 2001. Sami Zaman, the owner of Astoria's low-key Afghan restaurant Sami's Kabab House, where Astoria resident Mamdani filmed a campaign video with Sanders, was on the inaugural committee alongside filmmakers, writers, and activists. After becoming mayor, Mamdani will move from his one-bedroom Astoria apartment, protected from sharp price hikes by the city rent-stabilization program, to Gracie Mansion, the official residence of New York City mayors on Manhattan's upscale Upper East Side. Bankers and others in New York, the nation's financial capital, had expressed concern about Mamdani, but since his election, many have explored how to work with him. The city has had another mayor associated with democratic socialism, David Dinkins. Dinkins did not make much of his association with the Democratic Socialists of America. During his 1990-1993 term, he overcame budget deficits and persuaded private businesses to remain in New York, according to city archivists.",

    "content": "Trump's latest target in Washington?

He forcefully rebutted claims that his work was tainted by politics and delivered a granular defense of his office\u2019s tactics and prosecution strategy \u2014 all while repeatedly restating his view that Trump was guilty of a historic crime. He also revealed some new information about his witness list, and gave Judiciary Republicans a new opening to attack Cassidy Hutchinson\u2019s infamous testimony.\nA spokesperson for Smith declined to comment.\nHere\u2019s what we learned from the 255-page transcript:\nSmith built his case around Trump\u2019s allies\nSome of Smith\u2019s most substantive testimony centered on his never-implemented trial strategy: using Republicans who believed in Trump to make the case against him.\n\u201cThe president was preying on the party allegiance of people who supported him,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe evidence that I felt was most powerful was the evidence that came from people in his own party who \u2026 put country before party and were willing to tell the truth to him, even though it could mean trouble for them.\u201d\nSmith repeatedly drew on diehard Republicans to make the case against the man they wanted to become president but who they acknowledged had been defeated. Smith said former Vice President Mike Pence and several of the GOP elector nominees \u2014 like Pennsylvania\u2019s Lawrence Tabas \u2014 would have fit that bill and made strong trial witnesses.\n\u201cThat witness, Mr. Tabas, was of a similar group of witnesses who \u2014 these are not enemies of the president. These are people in his party who supported him,\u201d Smith continued. \u201cAnd I think the fact that they were telling him these things \u2026 would have had great weight and great credibility with a jury.\u201d\nSmith said he came to believe that Trump\u2019s Jan. 6, 2021, tweet attacking Pence while he was at the Capitol \u201cwithout question\u201d exacerbated the danger to Pence\u2019s life.\nSmith hadn\u2019t made his final charging decisions\nThe former special counsel said he never officially decided whether to bring additional charges against the figures he alleged were Trump\u2019s co-conspirators \u2014 including attorneys Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Kenneth Chesebro, John Eastman and Boris Epshteyn.\n\u201cI had not made final determinations about that at the time that President Trump won reelection, meaning that our office was going to be closed down,\u201d Smith said.\nSmith said he had no plans to call Eastman \u2014 an architect of Trump\u2019s last-ditch bid to stop Joe Biden\u2019s Electoral College certification in January 2021 \u2014 as a trial witness but said he would have welcomed Trump calling Eastman to the stand as a defense witness.\nSmith noted he interviewed Epshteyn, Giuliani and other alleged co-conspirators in the course of the investigation.\nLawmakers failed to knock Smith off his game\nThe former special counsel repeatedly leaned into the defense of his probe and expressed confidence that a jury would have convicted Trump if the case went to trial.\nHe refused to take Democrats\u2019 bait to attack Republicans for refusing, so far, to give him a public hearing. And he avoided straying into discussions that might have forced him to reveal subjects still protected by grand jury secrecy or a federal judge\u2019s order that barred him from disclosing details of his second investigation into President Trump\u2019s hoarding of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office in 2021.\n\u201cDid you have the opportunity to interview Mr. Pence as part of your investigation?\u201d a staffer asked Smith at one point.\nMore in Politics\n\u201cI think the answer to that question might involve [grand jury information], and so I'm not going to answer that,\u201d Smith said.\nWhen Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) pressed Smith about the structure of his classified documents report, Smith again demurred.\n\u201cI don't think I should even talk about that. I don't want to have any \u2014 any implication that I gave some sort of insight about how that report is constructed,\u2019 he said.\nSmith repeatedly reminded lawmakers that he\u2019s open to sharing the results of his classified documents investigation, but was restricted by the ruling from a federal judge in Florida who maintained Smith's report must stay under seal. The day of Smith\u2019s deposition, the Department of Justice also sent an email to Smith\u2019s team emphasizing the court order prevented him from sharing nonpublic information with Congress.\nAt one point, a staffer questioning Smith suggested it would be far more difficult to retrieve materials from Mar-a-Lago compared to elsewhere.\n\u201cI mean, a person can't just walk into Mar-a-Lago and try to abscond with these materials, right?\u201d the person, whose identity was redacted, asked.\n\u201cI would very much like to answer that question, but I cannot answer that question due to the final report,\u201d Smith responded.\nSmith forcefully rejected any hint of political bias\nRepublicans and Democrats repeatedly teed it up for him: Did politics influence Smith\u2019s decision to become special counsel or the way he handled his investigation? Did the White House ever lean on him or senior Justice Department officials like former Attorney General Merrick Garland and his deputy Lisa Monaco?\nEach time Smith was unequivocal: Not for a moment.\nSmith maintained he never communicated with Biden or White House staff before or during his investigation. He also said the timing of Trump\u2019s announcement for president, his crowded calendar of criminal cases leading up to the 2024 election and the sensitivity of certain allegations were nonfactors in his decisions. He emphasized that he regularly consulted with Justice Department officials to ensure he abided by its guidelines.\n\u201cWe certainly were not in any way intending to affect the outcome of the election. And to make sure we complied with the policy, we met with Public Integrity to make sure we were doing that,\u201d Smith said.\nMultiple people also asked Smith if he would be surprised if Trump directs his Department of Justice to target him. The former special counsel responded no.\n\u201cI have no doubt that the president wants to seek retribution against me,\u201d Smith said.\nLawmakers also pressed Smith about the executive order against his legal representation, Covington & Burling, in which Trump suspended security clearances for firm employees who had worked with Smith. It was one of several major law firms hit with penalties in the beginning of the second Trump administration.\n\u201cI think it's to chill people from having an association with me,\u201d Smith said.\nSmith didn\u2019t pursue \u2018uncooperative\u2019 witnesses\nThough there were few new details in Smith\u2019s testimony, he disclosed that he didn\u2019t pursue interviews with three figures close to Trump: Steve Bannon, Roger Stone and Peter Navarro. The reason, he said, was they were relatively uncooperative with congressional investigators and were unnecessary for his team to discern the details of Trump\u2019s bid to subvert the 2020 election.\n\u201cGiven the highly uncooperative nature of the individuals you talked about, I didn't think it would be fruitful to try to question them,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd the sort of information that they could provide us, in my view, wasn't worth immunizing them for their possible conduct.\u201d\nBut Smith also described a text exchange between Bannon and Epshteyn on the evening of Jan. 6 in which Bannon described Trump as \u201cstill on fire\u201d \u2014 an exchange he said was evidence that Trump did not see the riot as the end of his effort to prevent his defeat in the election.\nSmith defends pursuit of lawmakers\u2019 phone records\nRepublicans and Democrats pressed Smith extensively about his pursuit of the phone records of Republican lawmakers who Trump and his allies contacted during the days and weeks before Jan. 6, 2021.\nSmith said he wanted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy\u2019s records because he knew McCarthy spoke to the White House as violence unfolded that day. He also said the records they pursued were limited and intended to shore up the case if it went to trial \u2014 and all were obtained in accordance with DOJ policies governing the handling of investigations that touch on congressional records.\nSmith also emphasized he was not special counsel when Justice Department investigators obtained a two-year batch of House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan\u2019s phone records.\nThe former special counsel displayed detailed knowledge about the way the Constitution\u2019s Speech or Debate clause protects legislative activity from federal investigators and said he sought to comply with those limits. He noted that his office litigated Speech or Debate issues related to Pence and Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) during the course of the probe.\n\u201cMy office and I personally take the protections of the Speech or Debate Clause seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're an important part of separation of powers.\u201d\nHouse GOP revel in Smith comments on Cassidy Hutchinson\nIn the aftermath of the transcript\u2019s release, the Judiciary Republicans pointed to Smith\u2019s comments about Cassidy Hutchinson, the former White House aide who in 2022 testified against Trump in a dramatic hearing before the Democratic-led Jan. 6 committee.\nHutchinson famously said another Trump aide told her that a furious Trump lunged for the wheel after learning the vehicle he was in was headed for the White House instead of the Capitol after his incendiary Jan. 6 speech. Trump has long denied the incident.\nSmith told congressional investigators his office spoke to at least one officer who was in the SUV for Trump\u2019s return to the White House that day.\n\u201c[M]y recollection with Ms. Hutchinson, at least one of the issues was a number of the things that she gave evidence on were secondhand hearsay, were things that she had heard from other people and, as a result, that testimony may or may not be admissible, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be as powerful as firsthand testimony,\u201d Smith said.\n\u201cThe partisan January 6th Committee\u2019s ENTIRE case was just destroyed by\u2026 Jack Smith,\u201d the Judiciary GOP posted on X. \u201cStar witness completely unreliable!\u201d\nThe Jan. 6 committee grilled Hutchinson in part because Mark Meadows, her direct boss, declined to sit for an interview. Though Hutchinson\u2019s story was among the most explosive aspects of its public hearings, the case the committee made \u2014 that Trump systematically attempted to sow doubt about the 2020 election results and lean on state and federal officials to subvert it \u2014 was the product of hundreds of interviews, many from Trump\u2019s closest aides and allies.",

Lawmakers also pressed Smith about the executive order against his legal representation, Covington & Burling, in which Trump suspended security clearances for firm employees who had worked with Smith. It was one of several major law firms hit with penalties in the beginning of the second Trump administration. \u201cI think it's to chill people from having an association with me,\u201d Smith said. Smith didn\u2019t pursue \u2018uncooperative\u2019 witnesses Though there were few new details in Smith\u2019s testimony, he disclosed that he didn\u2019t pursue interviews with three figures close to Trump: Steve Bannon, Roger Stone and Peter Navarro. The reason, he said, was they were relatively uncooperative with congressional investigators and were unnecessary for his team to discern the details of Trump\u2019s bid to subvert the 2020 election. \u201cGiven the highly uncooperative nature of the individuals you talked about, I didn't think it would be fruitful to try to question them,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd the sort of information that they could provide us, in my view, wasn't worth immunizing them for their possible conduct.\u201d But Smith also described a text exchange between Bannon and Epshteyn on the evening of Jan. 6 in which Bannon described Trump as \u201cstill on fire\u201d \u2014 an exchange he said was evidence that Trump did not see the riot as the end of his effort to prevent his defeat in the election. Smith defends pursuit of lawmakers\u2019 phone records Republicans and Democrats pressed Smith extensively about his pursuit of the phone records of Republican lawmakers who Trump and his allies contacted during the days and weeks before Jan. 6, 2021. Smith said he wanted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy\u2019s records because he knew McCarthy spoke to the White House as violence unfolded that day. He also said the records they pursued were limited and intended to shore up the case if it went to trial \u2014 and all were obtained in accordance with DOJ policies governing the handling of investigations that touch on congressional records. Smith also emphasized he was not special counsel when Justice Department investigators obtained a two-year batch of House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan\u2019s phone records. The former special counsel displayed detailed knowledge about the way the Constitution\u2019s Speech or Debate clause protects legislative activity from federal investigators and said he sought to comply with those limits. He noted that his office litigated Speech or Debate issues related to Pence and Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) during the course of the probe. \u201cMy office and I personally take the protections of the Speech or Debate Clause seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're an important part of separation of powers.\u201d House GOP revel in Smith comments on Cassidy Hutchinson In the aftermath of the transcript\u2019s release, the Judiciary Republicans pointed to Smith\u2019s comments about Cassidy Hutchinson, the former White House aide who in 2022 testified against Trump in a dramatic hearing before the Democratic-led Jan. 6 committee. Hutchinson famously said another Trump aide told her that a furious Trump lunged for the wheel after learning the vehicle he was in was headed for the White House instead of the Capitol after his incendiary Jan. 6 speech. Trump has long denied the incident. Smith told congressional investigators his office spoke to at least one officer who was in the SUV for Trump\u2019s return to the White House that day. \u201c[M]y recollection with Ms. Hutchinson, at least one of the issues was a number of the things that she gave evidence on were secondhand hearsay, were things that she had heard from other people and, as a result, that testimony may or may not be admissible, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be as powerful as firsthand testimony,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe partisan January 6th Committee\u2019s ENTIRE case was just destroyed by\u2026 Jack Smith,\u201d the Judiciary GOP posted on X. \u201cStar witness completely unreliable!\u201d The Jan. 6 committee grilled Hutchinson in part because Mark Meadows, her direct boss, declined to sit for an interview. Though Hutchinson\u2019s story was among the most explosive aspects of its public hearings, the case the committee made \u2014 that Trump systematically attempted to sow doubt about the 2020 election results and lean on state and federal officials to subvert it \u2014 was the product of hundreds of interviews, many from Trump\u2019s closest aides and allies.",

Over the past six months, the stock has declined more than 65% from its peak of $450, back in July 2025.\nWith the Bitcoin price crashing to $87,000 and a weak 2025 for the asset, the impact on the MSTR stock has been more pronounced. While the crypto community was abuzz over the discussion of Strategy (MSTR) entering the S&P 500, the stock is now facing a major challenge ahead.\nThe MSTR stock faces the deadline of Jan. 15 over exclusion from the MSCI Index.

JPMorgan has predicted outflows up to $8.8 billion if this rule kicks in.\nThis triggered a major selling pressure in the MSTR stock during Q4 2025.

    "content_clean": "Key Takeaways - Stablecoin adoption was boosted by a variety of factors in 2025. - Crypto wallets are evolving beyond trading tools. - U.S. regulatory decisions could have global implications. Stablecoin usage expanded sharply in 2025, driving growth in crypto payments and on-chain trading even as broader market activity cooled, according to industry data. The trend comes as U.S. policymakers debate how tightly to regulate dollar-pegged digital tokens\u2014a move that a senior Coinbase executive warned could hand China a strategic advantage if handled poorly. Stablecoins Evolved In 2025 Bitget Wallet reported that increased on-chain activity across trading, payments, and yield products reflects a shift in how users interact with crypto wallets. Rather than serving primarily as tools for traders, wallets are increasingly being used for everyday spending and asset management, the company said. On-chain trading activity strengthened through much of the year. Monthly swap trading volume on Bitget Wallet exceeded $900 million, up 232% year over year. Meanwhile, on-chain derivatives activity also accelerated, with monthly perpetual futures volume nearing $5 billion\u2014an increase of 291% from a year earlier. Payments Drive Stablecoin Demand Payments emerged as a growing driver of wallet usage. Bitget Wallet said spending through its crypto-linked card rose more than sixfold in monthly volume since the product launched in July. Stablecoin-based yield products also gained traction as investors sought more predictable returns. Subscriptions to Bitget Wallet\u2019s earn products approached $200 million per quarter by late 2025, more than ten times higher than at the start of the year. \u201cThe data from 2025 points to a clear shift in how wallets are used,\u201d said Jamie Elkaleh, chief marketing officer of Bitget Wallet. 2025 Stablecoin Regulatory Concerns As stablecoin adoption grows, regulatory decisions in Washington are drawing increased scrutiny. Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase\u2019s chief policy officer, warned that restricting rewards or interest on U.S.-issued stablecoins could undermine their competitiveness at a time when China is moving in the opposite direction. Shirzad pointed to a recent announcement from the People\u2019s Bank of China that it plans to pay interest on the digital yuan, arguing that the move highlights what is at stake in U.S. legislative debates. \u201cIf this issue is mishandled, it could give non-U.S. stablecoins and central bank digital currencies a critical competitive advantage at the worst possible time,\u201d Shirzad said.",

    "body": "",
    "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) are cornerstones of the artificial intelligence trade. But while Morgan Stanely analysts led by Joseph Moore have buy ratings on both chip stocks, Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) is their top pick within in the semiconductor industry for 2026.\nReaders should be aware that most Wall Street analysts have a different opinion.\nAmong 69 analysts, Nvidia has a median target price of $250 per share. That implies 33% upside from its current share price of $187.\nAmong 52 analysts, Broadcom has a median target price of $460 per share. That implies 31% upside from its current share price of $350.\nAmong 44 analysts, Micron has a median target price of $305 per share. That implies 4% upside from its current share price of $293.\nHere's what investors should know.\n1. Nvidia\nNvidia is well known for its best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs), chips used to speed up compute-intensive data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) training and inference. However, the company is truly formidable because of its full-stack strategy that spans adjacent hardware and software development tools.\nNvidia develops rack-scale systems that pair GPUs with CPUs and networking equipment, which lets the company optimize performance across the entire data center, while saving clients the trouble of integrating hardware from multiple suppliers.\nIn addition, Nvidia's CUDA software platform provides developers with an extensive suite of code libraries, frameworks, and pretrained models that simplify application development across numerous of use cases, from predictive analytics and content generation to conversational agents and autonomous machines.\nConsequently, while custom AI chips designed by rivals like Broadcom may be cheaper, Nvidia systems often have the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) when every expense is include. \"Our TCO is so good that even when the competitors' chips are free, it's not cheap enough,\" according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\nNvidia dominates the AI accelerator space today with more than 80% market share, and the company is likely to maintain its dominance for the foreseeable future because it offers customers the lowest TCO. Wall Street expects Nvidia's earnings to grow at 37% annually in the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 46 times earnings look attractive.\n2. Broadcom\nBroadcom is a key player in two parts of the AI supply chain: networking chips and custom accelerators. The company has 80% market share in high-speed Ethernet switching and routing chips, a market forecast to grow at 20% to 30% annually in the next few years, per JPMorgan Chase. Its latest Tomahawk 6 (switching) and Jericho 3 (routing) chips offer industry-leading performance.\nBroadcom is also the leading supplier of custom AI accelerators, also called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), with 70% to 80% market share. The company has five major ASIC customers: Alphabet's Google, Meta Platforms, TikTok parent ByteDance, OpenAI, and Anthropic. However, Broadcom has other prospective customers in the pipeline, including Apple, Arm Holdings, and xAI. The AI accelerator market is projected to expand at 29% annually through 2033, according to Grand View Research.\nBeyond semiconductors, Broadcom subsidiary VMware is a leader in virtualization software. Consultancy Gartner recently recognized the company as a leader in distributed hybrid infrastructure, a setup that uses virtualization to combine public and private clouds into one manageable system. The data center virtualization market is forecast to grow at 21% annually through 2033, according to Grand View.\nWall Street estimates Broadcom's adjusted earnings will grow at 36% annually during the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 51 times earnings look attractive.\n3. Micron Technology\nMicron develops memory and storage solutions for personal computers, mobile devices, data center servers, and automotive systems. The company sells DRAM (dynamic random access memory) products, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM) created by stacking DRAM chips, and NAND products.\nDRAM products offer fast, short-term memory for active applications, and NAND products provide slow, long-term memory for file storage. Both are important for artificial intelligence workloads; DRAM (especially HBM) products offer the bandwidth needed for training and inference, while NAND products provide the storage needed for datasets and AI models.\nImportantly, Micron is not the market leader in DRAM or NAND products, but the company is gaining market share in both categories and its primary competitors, Samsung and SK Hynix, are losing market share. Particularly important, Micron gained 10 percentage points of market share in HBM over the past year.\nWhy is Morgan Stanley so bullish? The analysts argue the ongoing AI buildout has led to the most severe DRAM and NAND shortage in the last three decades. That shortage is driving prices higher and Micron is well-positioned to benefit. Indeed, Wall Street expects Micron's earnings to grow at 48% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 28 times earnings look quite cheap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Another $1 billion has been set aside for specialty crops and sugar, but the administration hasn't released any details of aid for those crops.\nAfter Trump met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, the White House said Beijing had promised to buy at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of the calendar year, plus 25 million metric tons a year in each of the next three years. Officials have said China is on track to meet the 12 million metric ton goal by the end of February.\nAs of Dec. 18, China had bought about 6 million metric tons of soybeans, according to the latest USDA\u2019s weekly report.

    "headline": "Trump Is Promising That the U.S. Will Return to the Moon. Does That Really Make Little-Known SIDU Stock a Buy?",
    "body": "",
    "content": "Investor excitement around space stocks has been building rapidly as President Donald Trump renews his push for U.S. leadership in space and pledges a return to the Moon before the end of the decade. That rhetoric has helped lift the entire space technology sector, sending shares of both well-known names and obscure microcaps higher.\nOne of the beneficiaries of this shift has been Sidus Space (SIDU), a little-known microcap that has seen its shares soar as optimism around Trump\u2019s space agenda spreads across the sector. Recent headlines around defense contracts and capital raises have only added fuel to the move. But beneath the excitement lies a critical question for investors: does a more aggressive U.S. push toward the Moon actually translate into meaningful financial upside for Sidus Space\u2014or is the stock simply being swept higher by speculation and short-term momentum? Let\u2019s take a closer look!\nValued at a market cap of $94.1 million, Sidus Space operates across the commercial space, aerospace, and defense sectors. The company acts as a space mission enabler, offering services that span satellite design, manufacturing, and data collection. Its flagship product, LizzieSat, is a 3D-printed, multi-mission satellite built for flexibility and cost efficiency, with the ability to integrate new technologies to support a wide range of mission needs. The company also provides AI-driven Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) through its Orlaith AI ecosystem, which features proprietary FeatherEdge and Cielo platforms for processing and delivering space-based data insights.\nShares of the innovative space and defense technology company have dropped 27% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. However, SIDU shares have spiked more than fourfold over the past month, largely driven by three key catalysts that I\u2019ll outline below.\nWhy Sidus Space Stock Skyrocketed This Month\nOn Dec. 22, SIDU stock nearly doubled after the company announced it had secured a contract under the Missile Defense Agency\u2019s (MDA) Scalable Homeland Innovative Enterprise Layered Defense (SHIELD) program. The SHIELD contract supports President Trump\u2019s plan for the \u201cGolden Dome\u201d for America's missile defense system. The indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract has a ceiling value of $151 billion. Notably, securing a spot on the IDIQ makes Sidus Space eligible to compete for future task orders as the MDA defines work requirements, but it does not guarantee any revenue on its own.\n\u201cThis milestone reflects our ability to deliver integrated solutions across multiple domains and demonstrates the strength of our approach to building long-term capability within the defense sector,\u201d said Carol Craig, founder and CEO of Sidus Space.\nEarlier, on Dec. 19, SIDU shares jumped more than 35% after President Trump signed an executive order titled \u201cEnsuring American Space Superiority,\u201d which formally calls for a U.S. return to the lunar surface by 2028, aligning with the final year of his second term. The directive represents an update to his first-term 2017 space policy, which had originally targeted 2024 for a human landing before facing delays.\nSidus Space took advantage of its stock surge by pricing two public offerings. The first offering closed last Wednesday, raising roughly $25 million in gross proceeds, while the second closed on Monday and generated about $16.2 million. Interestingly, SIDU shares sold off after the first offering was announced but rebounded once it closed, and the same pattern played out following the second offering. This suggests investors shifted their focus to the company\u2019s long-term growth prospects, betting that the fresh capital will be used to fund future expansion. The company said it plans to deploy the new capital toward sales and marketing, operating expenses, product development, manufacturing expansion, working capital, and general corporate purposes.\nSuch capital raises are especially critical for companies generating only modest revenue while continuing to burn cash, and in SIDU\u2019s case, the timing could hardly have been better. In the third quarter, the company\u2019s revenue stood at $1.3 million, down 31% year-over-year (YoY). The revenue decline reflected a strategic pivot away from legacy services toward new commercial models. At the same time, its net loss widened 55% YoY to $6.0 million. The company held $12.7 million in cash as of Sept. 30, while cash burn totaled $14.1 million over the first nine months of the year, equating to roughly $4.7 million per quarter. However, following the recent capital raise, the company\u2019s liquidity position appears solid.\nSpace Stocks Post Strong Year With Further Upside Likely Amid U.S. Lunar Mission Push\nSIDU\u2019s stock gains have come amid a favorable backdrop for space technology companies. The sector has had a strong year, buoyed by rising excitement around a potential SpaceX IPO, increased launch activity, and President Trump\u2019s executive order calling for a U.S. return to the Moon by 2028. Newly appointed NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said on CNBC last Friday that the U.S. will return to the Moon during President Trump\u2019s second term. Isaacman told CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell Overtime\u201d that Mr. Trump\u2019s renewed commitment to lunar exploration is critical to unlocking what he called the \u201corbital economy.\u201d \u201cWe want to have that opportunity to explore and realize the scientific, economic, and national security potential on the moon,\u201d Isaacman said.\nIsaacman said lunar opportunities include building space-based data centers and infrastructure, along with the potential extraction of Helium-3, a rare gas embedded in the moon\u2019s surface that could one day serve as a key fuel for fusion power. He added that once a \u201cmoon base\u201d is established, NASA would look to invest in nuclear power and space-based nuclear propulsion to support further exploration. NASA is currently working with multiple contractors, including SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Boeing (BA), as part of its Artemis campaign, which is focused on returning to the Moon and laying the groundwork for future missions to Mars.\nMeanwhile, Sidus Space serves as a key subcontractor to Collins Aerospace on NASA\u2019s $3.5 billion Exploration Extravehicular Activity Services (xEVAS) contract, helping develop next-generation spacesuits and hardware for the ISS and Artemis lunar missions. It also supports lunar exploration through other NASA programs such as the Intuitive Machines-led RACER lunar rover team. Earlier this month, Sidus Space announced it was serving as a subcontractor to MobLobSpace under a NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award focused on improving orbital debris monitoring. It\u2019s also worth noting that this year, Sidus Space completed on-orbit operations of its advanced onboard edge computer, FeatherEdge GEN-2, integrated into the ongoing commissioning of LizzieSat-3.\nDoes the U.S. Lunar Mission Push Make SIDU Stock a Buy?\nUndoubtedly, the U.S. push to return to the Moon provides a positive backdrop for the entire space sector. However, it appears the key catalyst currently driving Sidus Space shares is the company\u2019s inclusion on the SHIELD contract. In any case, I don\u2019t view SIDU stock as a \u201cBuy\u201d at current levels. Buying the stock now would amount to chasing a rally, which is rarely a good idea, and the recent surge appears driven largely by speculation and short-squeeze dynamics rather than underlying fundamentals. That\u2019s because neither a renewed commitment to lunar missions by the Trump administration nor inclusion on the SHIELD contract guarantees a direct financial impact.\nSidus Space has light coverage on Wall Street, with just one analyst following the stock and assigning it a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating. The analyst\u2019s bullish stance is also reflected in SIDU stock\u2019s $10 price target, which implies upside potential of more than 270%.\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
