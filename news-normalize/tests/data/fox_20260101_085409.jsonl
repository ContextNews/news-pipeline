To help out in your search, here are a few answers to the most commonly asked questions consumers have when buying a new mattress online.\nWhich brand is best for mattresses?\nPicking out the best mattress brand will depend entirely on your specific needs, preferences and budget. The brands featured in our guide consistently receive high ratings and are well-regarded for different reasons. Many of these mattress brands offer mattress quizzes that can help guide you to options based on your preferences.\nHow long do mattresses usually last?\nHow long your mattress lasts depends on the quality of the mattress and how you care for it. You will know it's time to replace your mattress if you see signs of visible sagging or deep body impressions. Another good indicator signaling that your mattress is likely to no longer provide adequate support is if you consistently wake up with back, neck, hip or shoulder pain that wasn't there before. An old mattress can accumulate dust mites, mold and allergens, leading to increased allergy symptoms.\nWhat is the best mattress to buy?\nChoosing the best mattress depends on individual needs and preferences. Side sleepers generally do better with a softer to medium-firm mattress that contours to their body to relieve pressure on hips and shoulders and maintain spinal alignment. Back sleepers may prefer a medium to firm mattress that provides consistent support to keep the neck, shoulders and torso aligned. Stomach sleepers should opt for a firmer mattress to prevent their hips from sinking too far, which can lead to back pain.\nIf you’re an Amazon Prime member, you can get these items sent to your door ASAP.

{"article_id": "ab29629074ea022e", "source": "fox", "headline": "China’s ‘condom tax’ sparks backlash as Beijing struggles to reverse population collapse", "body": "China introduced a 13% tax on contraceptives while exempting childcare services as the global superpower battles sustained population decline and aging demographics.", "content": "China will begin charging a 13% value-added tax on contraceptives starting Jan. 1 while exempting childcare services from the same tax, a move authorities say is part of a broader effort to boost births as the country faces a sustained population decline, according to the BBC and The Associated Press.\nThe tax overhaul, announced late last year, removes exemptions that had been in place since 1994, when China was still enforcing its decades-long one-child policy.\nAlongside the new tax on contraceptives such as condoms and birth control pills, the Chinese government is exempting childcare, marriage-related services and elderly care from the value-added tax (VAT), the BBC reported.\nBeijing has been pressing young people to marry and have children as it grapples with an aging population and a sluggish economy. Official figures show China’s population has shrunk for three consecutive years with about 9.54 million babies born in 2024.\nWHY GEN Z DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE KIDS\nThat figure is roughly half the number of births recorded a decade earlier, when China began easing limits on family size, according to national statistics cited by the BBC and the AP.\nChina’s population pressures have been mounting for years. Births fell from about 14.7 million in 2019 to roughly 9.5 million in 2024. In 2023, India officially overtook China as the world’s most populous country.\nThe new tax on contraceptives has drawn ridicule and concern inside China. On social media, some users joked about stockpiling condoms before prices rise, while others argued that the cost of contraception is insignificant compared with the expense of raising a child, the BBC reported.\n\"I have one child, and I don’t want any more,\" Daniel Luo, a 36-year-old resident of Henan province, told the BBC. He said the price increase would not change his family plans, comparing it to small hikes in subway fares that do not alter daily behavior.\nOthers worry the policy could have unintended consequences. Rosy Zhao, who lives in the central city of Xi’an, told the BBC making contraception more expensive could lead students or people under financial strain to take risks. She called that the policy’s most dangerous potential outcome.\nA SOLUTION TO THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM: MARRIAGE\nHealth experts echoed those concerns in interviews with the AP, warning that higher prices could reduce access to contraception and contribute to more unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. China recorded more than 670,000 cases of syphilis and over 100,000 cases of gonorrhea in 2024, according to data from the National Disease Control and Prevention Administration.\nChina has also reported some of the highest abortion numbers in the world. Between 2014 and 2021, authorities recorded between 9 million and 10 million abortions annually, according to the National Health Commission. China stopped publishing abortion data in 2022.\nDemographers and policy analysts remain skeptical that taxing contraceptives will meaningfully raise birth rates. Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, told the BBC the idea that higher condom prices would influence fertility decisions amounts to overthinking the policy.\nValue-added tax revenue, which totaled close to $1 trillion last year, accounts for about 40% of China’s tax collection, according to figures cited by the BBC.\nHenrietta Levin of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) described the move as symbolic, reflecting Beijing’s attempt to lift what she called strikingly low fertility numbers. She also cautioned that many incentives and subsidies depend on provincial governments that are already heavily indebted, raising questions about whether they can fund the measures adequately.\nJAPAN REJECTS SAME-SEX MARRIAGE TO SAVE ITSELF FROM DEMOGRAPHIC COLLAPSE\nPublic health experts interviewed by the AP said the policy could disproportionately affect women, who shoulder most responsibility for birth control in China. Research released by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2022 found condoms are used by about 9% of couples, while 44.2% rely on intrauterine devices and 30.5% on female sterilization. Male sterilization accounts for 4.7%.\nSome women say the tax revives resentment toward the government’s long history of involvement in reproductive decisions. The Communist Party enforced the one-child policy from roughly 1980 until 2015 through fines, penalties and, in some cases, forced abortions, according to the AP. Children born outside the policy were sometimes denied household registration, effectively rendering them non-citizens.\n\"It is a disciplinary tactic, a management of women’s bodies and my sexual desire,\" Zou Xuan, a 32-year-old teacher in Jiangxi province, told the AP.\nConcerns about further state intrusion have also surfaced in recent months. The BBC reported that women in some provinces have received calls from local officials asking about menstrual cycles and pregnancy plans. A health bureau in Yunnan province said the information was needed to identify expectant mothers, a move critics say risks alienating the very families Beijing hopes to encourage.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nLevin warned that such approaches could damage public trust. She told the BBC, \"The [Communist] party can't help but insert itself into every decision that it cares about. So, it ends up being its own worst enemy in some ways.\"\nWhile the government is adjusting policies once used to limit population growth, experts caution that reversing decades-long demographic trends will be much more difficult than increasing prices at the checkout counter, especially after years of policies that shaped whether families could have children.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/chinas-condom-tax-sparks-backlash-beijing-struggles-reverse-population-collapse", "published_at": "2025-12-31T21:39:21-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

She’s a podcaster and bourbon insider.\nTARIFFS PUSH US WINE INDUSTRY INTO UNCERTAIN TERRITORY: 'REALLY CREATES A CHALLENGE'\n\"Bourbon is Kentucky, right? We love horse racing in Kentucky. We love bourbon in Kentucky. It's the reason that 2.7 million people come to visit the Commonwealth every single year,\" said Coffey. \"It’s some of the biggest news to come out of Kentucky in quite some time, and this is one of the most iconic brands in bourbon.\"\nNot everyone has heard of Willett or Four Roses when it comes to bourbon. But Jim Beam is Americana. Ubiquitous. Kind of like McDonald’s or Coke.\nAmericans are imbibing less — down 6% from just two years ago. And more than 16 million barrels of Kentucky spirits — including bourbon and rye — are aging in warehouses across the state. Distillers are paying taxes on those barrels while they age.\nIt’s an issue of supply and demand. But the problem is not exclusive to Jim Beam.\n\"It's not a question of who's shutting down production,\" said Charlie Prince, who runs the Drammers Whiskey Club. \"It's a question of who is admitting it.\"\nOverseas distillers like Midleton in Ireland, which makes Jameson, and Highland Park in Scotland all reduced production recently because of a glut of bourbon, whiskey and Scotch on the market.\nHowever, observers say tariffs and the trade war with Canada hit Jim Beam especially hard.\n\"Ten percent of Kentucky bourbon sales were going to Canada, and that has dropped to almost zero,\" said Prince. \"In Canada, that has been taken on as a kind of a national mission for Canadians, saying, ‘Let's buy Canadian’ and push back against the politics they don't like coming from the U.S. And, so, you see stores just pulling all American products and banning them in some provinces. So, that's definitely a political response.\"\nDemocrats quickly latched onto the tariff argument.\n\"Thousands of Kentuckians power the bourbon industry. We will all feel the impact of this,\" declared Rep. Morgan McGarvey, D-Ky. \"It’s hard to overstate just how devastating Trump’s tariffs are for America’s signature spirit.\"\nRECORD LOW NUMBER OF AMERICANS REPORT DRINKING ALCOHOL, AND NEW TEETOTALERS ARE EXPLAINING WHY\nBut one industry observer believes that tariffs are a single ingredient in a complex economic cocktail. Jessica Spector is a professor at Yale who studies the history and culture of liquor and spirits.\n\"Anybody that tells you that they have an explanation, ‘Oh, it's tariffs,’ or 'Oh, it's post-pandemic retraction,’ is giving you a too simplistic explanation,\" said Spector. \"It's unclear what impact the tariffs are having and will have in the future. People have argued over tariffs for a long time. As long as there has been trade, there have been arguments over tariffs. It's unclear whether the tariffs are sort of the coup de gras to an industry that was already suffering.\"\nSpector says yes, Generation Z drinks less and uses cannabis more. There are also health concerns. But the spirits industry has witnessed shifts before. She says people moved from brown liquor to vodka in the 1970s because it was seen as healthier.\n\"They also jogged more and did a lot more cocaine because that was seen as more health conscious. So, it gets really complicated when you break things down generationally,\" said Spector.\nBut the tariffs remain extraordinarily controversial. The Trump administration says tariffs are here to stay.\n\"Tariffs are going to be part of the policy landscape,\" United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Fox. \"We know they’re successful.\"\nBut the tariffs may also evaporate.\nThe Constitution grants Congress the authority to tax and impose tariffs. President Trump used emergency powers to levy global tariffs earlier this year. That’s why this issue wound up at the Supreme Court. Attorneys argued the case in October.\n\"Canada is one of our closest allies. I think it would be hard to find Canada engaging in unfair trade practices because we have what used to be called the NAFTA agreement, between Canada, the United States and Mexico to bring down all the trade barriers between the countries,\" said University of California law professor John Yoo.\nBased on the oral arguments, Yoo believes the high court will halt the Trump-imposed tariffs under the premise that the U.S. faces a national emergency.\n\"Canada will immediately benefit, and you'll be able to find your choice of American bourbons on Canadian store shelves,\" said Yoo.\nFREEDOM AND FACTS, NOT FEAR, SHOULD FRAME AMERICA'S CHOICES ON ALCOHOL\nIn fact, Yoo believes the Supreme Court could issue its ruling sooner rather than later — especially if it nixes the tariffs. That’s because of all the duties and fees that might be levied on products for months — and then reversed.\nIt’s important to note that Jim Beam will continue operating two other distilleries for the time being. And Spector says Generation Z prefers cocktails. So, that could force the industry to shift what it produces.\nNow here’s a little tidbit you probably won’t learn any place else.\nRoam any distillery in Scotland, be it Dalwhinnie in the Highlands, Glen Scotia in Campbeltown, GlenGrant in Speyside or Bowmore on Islay, and you will find distillers aging Scotch in Jim Beam barrels.\nIt’s not just Jim Beam barrels that you will find in Scotland. It’s also Buffalo Trace. Heaven Hill. Woodford Reserve. Wild Turkey. Congress only allows American distillers to use American oak barrels once for producing bourbon. So, Scotch distillers overseas love to get their hands on a good bourbon barrel to age their spirit.\nThe barrels may partially impart a vanilla flavor into the expression, stemming from \"vanillans\" in the wood.\nThe trend of using American bourbon barrels for Scotch began in the 1940s after the U.S. market came back online following the end of Prohibition. Distillers in Scotland began using sherry barrels to age their spirits prior to that (hence, the rich meaty flavors you get from Macallan). Sherry is still prevalent despite a decline in people consuming sherry these days. But fewer bourbon barrels from a big producer like Jim Beam now could alter the taste of Scotch in about 15 to 20 years.\nThat said, demand for Scotch is down like bourbon. So, some of these may even out.\nIt’s worth noting that Suntory Global Spirits owns Jim Beam. It was known as Beam Suntory until recently. Suntory also owns major Scotch labels like Bowmore, Admore, Laphroaig, Auchentoshan and Glen Garioch. The pipeline of barrels from Jim Beam was a good proposition for Suntory to age Scotch.\nSo, it’s possible that, down the road, Scotch distillers may age some of their expressions in barrels that once contained something else — other than Kentucky bourbon. And that’s where the flavor profile will evolve.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIt’s also impossible to know the market trends and what people will be interested in drinking in 15 to 20 years. And, so, whatever distillers put into a barrel now might not match market trends in the future.\nIn fact, perhaps people will revert to drinking bourbon and Scotch. And the market glut now may switch into a spirits famine where products consumers want are hard to find.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jim-beam-shuts-iconic-kentucky-distillery-least-year-market-downturn", "published_at": "2025-12-31T20:05:13-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

He pointed to ongoing ISIS activity not only in Syria and Iraq, but also in Afghanistan and other regions, citing United Nations reporting that estimates roughly 2,000 ISIS fighters remain active in Afghanistan alone.\n\"That’s not what a defeated group looks like,\" Roggio said, noting that ISIS continues to recruit, indoctrinate and inspire attacks even without the visibility it once had.\nOne of the most sensitive vulnerabilities remains the network of detention facilities in northeastern Syria holding thousands of ISIS terrorists and supporters. Those prisons are guarded primarily by Kurdish-led forces backed by a small U.S. military presence, estimated at roughly 1,000 troops, according to Reuters.\nU.S. and coalition officials have repeatedly warned that any major disruption to prison security could allow hardened ISIS operatives to escape and reconstitute networks across Syria and beyond. Kurdish officials have also raised concerns about funding shortages, manpower strain and pressure from rival militias operating nearby.\nWhile U.S. officials have not publicly linked the recent strikes to prison-related threats, analysts say the broader environment of fragmented control increases the risk of coordinated attacks, insider assistance or prison unrest.\nThe danger is not theoretical. ISIS has previously staged mass prison break operations in Syria and Iraq, including a 2022 assault on the al-Sinaa prison in Hasakah that required days of fighting to contain.\nThe U.S. strikes also come amid continued instability inside Syria, where multiple armed actors operate with overlapping authority. Analysts note that clashes among militias, sectarian violence and unresolved command structures have weakened overall security and diverted attention from counterterrorism efforts.\nUS, SYRIAN TROOPS COME UNDER FIRE WHILE ON PATROL: REPORT\nBombings in neighborhoods of Damascus, including Mezzeh, and unrest in minority areas have further illustrated the gaps ISIS and other extremist groups can exploit, according to regional security assessments and open-source reporting.\n\"Syria’s chaos is the accelerant,\" Roggio said. \"ISIS thrives where no one is fully in charge.\"\nU.S. officials and analysts stress that ISIS activity in Syria is part of a wider pattern rather than an isolated flare-up.\nSources in the Israeli Mossad told Fox News Digital of continued ISIS-linked activity across multiple theaters, including recruitment networks and small-scale attacks designed to test security responses and maintain operational relevance.\nIn Turkey, security forces recently clashed with Islamic State militants during counterterrorism operations, wounding several officers, according to Reuters on Monday. Turkish authorities said the raids targeted ISIS cells suspected of planning attacks inside the country.\nDEADLY STRIKE ON US TROOPS TESTS TRUMP’S COUNTER-ISIS PLAN — AND HIS TRUST IN SYRIA’S NEW LEADER\n\"These are signals, not spikes,\" Roggio said. \"ISIS operates across regions, adapting to pressure and exploiting weak governance wherever it finds it.\"\nThe renewed U.S. military action raises difficult questions for policymakers about how long the current containment strategy can hold.\nWhile U.S. officials say the Dec. 19 strikes delivered a significant blow to ISIS infrastructure, they have also acknowledged that counterterrorism operations alone cannot eliminate the underlying conditions that allow the group to persist.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Just because we want to declare the war against terror over doesn’t mean it’s over,\" Roggio said. \"The enemy gets a vote.\"", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/isis-exploiting-syrias-chaos-us-strikes-expose-growing-threat", "published_at": "2025-12-31T06:00:48-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

{"article_id": "03c543915ab94147", "source": "fox", "headline": "Ukraine–Russia at a crossroads: How the war evolved in 2025 and what comes next", "body": "President Donald Trump engaged Ukraine, Russian leaders throughout 2025 in unprecedented diplomatic push to end the war, including Alaska summit and Mar-a-Lago meetings.", "content": "President Donald Trump spent much of 2025 attempting what had eluded his predecessors: personally engaging both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an effort to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. From high-profile summits to direct phone calls, the administration pushed for a negotiated settlement even as the fighting ground on and the map changed little.\nBy year’s end, the outlines of a potential deal were clearer than they had been at any point since Russia’s full-scale invasion, with U.S. and Ukrainian officials coalescing around a revised 20-point framework addressing ceasefire terms, security guarantees and disputed territory. But 2025 also made clear why the war has proven so resistant to resolution: neither battlefield pressure, economic sanctions nor intensified diplomacy were enough to force Moscow or Kyiv into concessions they were unwilling to make.\nThe Trump administration’s push for a deal\nThe year began with a high-profile fallout last February between President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, when the Ukrainian leader stormed out of the White House after Trump told him he did not have \"any cards\" to bring to negotiations with Russia.\nFrustrated by the pace of talks after promising to end the war on \"Day One\" of his presidency, Trump initially directed his ire toward Zelenskyy before later conceding that Moscow, not Kyiv, was standing in the way of progress.\n\"I thought the Russia-Ukraine war was the easiest to stop but Putin has let me down,\" Trump said in September 2025.\nThat frustration had already surfaced publicly months earlier as Russian strikes continued despite diplomatic engagement. \"He talks nice, and then he bombs everybody in the evening,\" Trump said in July.\nTrump’s outreach to Russian President Vladimir Putin culminated in a high-profile summit in Alaska in August, though additional meetings were later called off amid a lack of progress toward a deal.\nZELENSKYY ENCOURAGED BY 'VERY GOOD' CHRISTMAS TALKS WITH US\nStill, Trump struck a more optimistic tone toward the end of the year. On Sunday, after meeting Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago, the president said the sides were \"getting a lot closer, maybe very close\" to a peace agreement, while acknowledging that major obstacles remained — including the status of disputed territory such as the Donbas region, which he described as \"very tough.\"\nTrump said the meeting followed what he described as a \"very positive\" phone call with Putin that lasted more than two hours, underscoring the administration’s continued effort to press both sides toward a negotiated end to the war.\nWhere negotiations stand now\nBy the end of 2025, the diplomatic track had narrowed around a more defined — but still contested — framework. U.S. officials and Ukrainian negotiators have been working from a revised 20-point proposal that outlines a potential ceasefire, security guarantees for Ukraine, and mechanisms to address disputed territory and demilitarized zones.\nZelenskyy has publicly signaled openness to elements of the framework while insisting that any agreement must include robust, long-term security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. Ukrainian officials have also made clear that questions surrounding occupied territory, including parts of the Donbas, cannot be resolved solely through ceasefire lines without broader guarantees.\nRussia, however, has not agreed to the proposal. Moscow has continued to insist on recognition of its territorial claims and has resisted terms that would constrain its military posture or require meaningful concessions. Russian officials have at times linked their negotiating stance to developments on the battlefield, reinforcing the Kremlin’s view that leverage — not urgency — should dictate the pace of talks.\nThe result is a negotiation process that is more structured than earlier efforts, but still far from resolution: positions have hardened even as channels remain open, and talks continue alongside ongoing fighting rather than replacing it.\nRussia’s territorial pressure — and Ukraine’s limited gains\nEven as diplomacy intensified in 2025, the war on the ground remained defined by slow, grinding territorial pressure rather than decisive breakthroughs. Russian forces continued pushing for incremental gains in eastern and southern Ukraine, particularly along axes tied to Moscow’s long-stated objective of consolidating control over territory it claims as Russian.\nRussian advances were measured and costly, often unfolding village by village through artillery-heavy assaults and sustained drone use rather than sweeping offensives. While Moscow failed to capture major new cities or trigger a collapse in Ukrainian defenses, it expanded control in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine, maintaining pressure across multiple fronts and keeping territorial questions central to both the fighting and any future negotiations.\nUkraine, for its part, did not mount a large-scale counteroffensive in 2025 comparable to earlier phases of the war. Ukrainian forces achieved localized tactical successes, at times reclaiming small areas or reversing specific Russian advances, but these gains were limited in scope and often temporary. None translated into a sustained territorial breakthrough capable of altering the broader balance of the front.\nInstead, Kyiv focused on preventing further losses, reinforcing defensive lines and imposing costs on Russian forces through precision strikes and asymmetric tactics. With decisive territorial gains out of reach, Ukraine expanded attacks against Russian energy infrastructure, targeting refineries, fuel depots and other hubs critical to sustaining Moscow’s war effort — including sites deep inside Russian territory.\nZELENSKYY SAYS FRESH RUSSIAN ATTACK ON UKRAINE SHOWS PUTIN'S 'TRUE ATTITUDE' AHEAD OF TRUMP MEETING\nRussia, meanwhile, continued its own campaign against Ukraine’s energy grid, striking power and heating infrastructure as part of a broader effort to strain Ukraine’s economy, civilian resilience and air defenses. The result was a widening pattern of horizontal escalation, as both sides sought leverage beyond the front lines without achieving a decisive military outcome.\nThe result was a battlefield stalemate with movement at the margins: Russia advanced just enough to sustain its territorial claims and domestic narrative, while Ukraine proved capable of blunting assaults and imposing costs but not of reclaiming large swaths of occupied land. The fighting underscored a central reality of 2025 — territory still mattered deeply to both sides, but neither possessed the military leverage needed to force a decisive shift.\nThat dynamic would increasingly shape the limits of diplomacy. Without a major change on the battlefield, talks could test red lines and clarify positions, but not compel compromise.\nWhy talks stalled: leverage without decision\nFor all the diplomatic activity in 2025, negotiations repeatedly ran into the same obstacle: neither Russia nor Ukraine faced the kind of pressure that would force a decisive compromise.\nOn the battlefield, Russia continued to absorb losses while pressing for incremental territorial gains, reinforcing Moscow’s belief that time remained on its side. Ukrainian forces, though increasingly strained, succeeded in preventing a collapse and in imposing costs through deep strikes and attacks on Russia’s energy infrastructure — demonstrating an ability to shape the conflict even without major territorial advances.\nEconomic pressure also reshaped — but did not determine — Moscow’s calculus. Despite years of Western sanctions, Russia continued financing its war effort in 2025, ramping up defense production and adapting its economy to sustain prolonged conflict. While sanctions constrained growth and access to advanced technology, they raised the long-term costs of the war without producing the immediate pressure needed to force President Vladimir Putin toward concessions.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nThose realities defined the limits of U.S. mediation. While the Trump administration pushed both sides to clarify red lines and explore possible frameworks for ending the war, Washington could illuminate choices without dictating outcomes, absent a decisive shift on the ground or a sudden change in Moscow’s calculations.\nThe result was a year of talks that clarified positions without closing gaps. As long as pressure produced pain without decision, negotiations could narrow options and define boundaries, even if they could not yet bring the conflict to an end.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ukraine-russia-crossroads-how-war-evolved-2025-what-comes-next", "published_at": "2025-12-31T08:29:15-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-01T08:54:09.484918+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Cybercriminals never slow down. In fact, the holidays and the start of a new year often bring a surge in scams, account takeovers and data theft. The good news is that cybersecurity need not feel overwhelming. You do not need advanced skills or expensive tools. With a few smart habits, you can lower your risk and protect your digital life throughout 2026. To help you start the year strong, here are 10 simple cybersecurity resolutions that actually work.\nSign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\nGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you’ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide — free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.\nAMERICA'S MOST-USED PASSWORD IN 2025 REVEALED\n1) Start the year with strong passwords\nPasswords remain your first line of defense. Weak or reused passwords make it easy for attackers to break into multiple accounts at once. Use a unique password for every account. Longer passphrases work better than short, complex strings. A reputable password manager can generate and securely store passwords, so you do not have to memorize them. One rule matters most. Never reuse passwords.\nNext, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.\nCheck out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.\n2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second step after your password. This usually includes a code from an app or a physical security key. Even if someone steals your password, 2FA can block access. App-based authenticators provide stronger protection than text messages. Turn it on for email, banking, social media and shopping accounts first.\n3) Audit your digital presence\nOld accounts create new risks. Take time to review shopping sites, forums, apps and subscriptions you no longer use. Delete what you do not need. Update privacy settings on what you keep. Share less personal information whenever possible, especially birthdays, locations and phone numbers. A smaller digital footprint limits abuse.\n5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE\n4) Keep software and devices up to date\nSecurity updates fix real vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploit. Skipping updates leaves doors open. Enable automatic updates for operating systems, browsers, apps, routers and smart devices. This habit blocks many common attacks without extra effort. Outdated software remains one of the top causes of successful hacks.\n5) Use a personal data removal service\nYour personal information appears on hundreds of data broker sites. These sites collect names, addresses, phone numbers and relatives, then sell access to anyone willing to pay. A personal data removal service helps locate and remove that information. This step reduces scam attempts, phishing messages and identity fraud risks throughout the year. Less exposed data means fewer threats.\nWhile no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\nCheck out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting Cyberguy.com.\nGet a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com\n6) Consider identity theft protection\nIdentity theft often starts quietly. A breach happens. Data leaks. Fraud follows months later. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Many services can also scan for accounts tied to multiple email addresses, making cleanup easier. Early alerts help you act before damage spreads.\nSee my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.\nPROTECT YOURSELF FROM SNEAKY WEB INJECTION SCAMS\n7) Think before you click and use strong antivirus protection\nMost cyberattacks still begin with a click. Fake shipping notices, refund alerts and urgent messages push people to act fast. Pause before clicking links or opening attachments. Many scams now use AI to generate realistic messages, fake voices and convincing images, making it even more important to pause before you click. Verify messages through official websites or apps instead. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by blocking malware, ransomware and malicious downloads across your devices, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\nGet my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.\n8) Secure your home Wi-Fi network\nYour Wi-Fi network connects everything. That makes it a valuable target. Change the default router password right away. Enable WPA3 encryption if your router supports it. Keep router firmware up to date and avoid sharing your network with unknown devices. A secure network protects every connected device.\n9) Back up your data regularly\nBackups protect you from ransomware, hardware failure and accidental deletion. Many people still skip them. Use cloud backups, an external hard drive or both. Automate the process so it runs without reminders. If something goes wrong, backups let you recover quickly.\n10) Freeze your credit if you do not need it\nA credit freeze prevents new accounts from opening in your name. It remains one of the strongest defenses against identity fraud heading into 2026. Freezing credit is free and reversible. You can temporarily lift it when applying for loans or credit cards. This single step blocks many identity crimes outright. To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"\nPro tip: Lock down your email and use aliases\nYour email account controls password resets, alerts and account recovery. If attackers get in, they can reach nearly everything else. Secure your primary email with a long, unique password and two-factor authentication. Then create email aliases for shopping, subscriptions and sign-ups. Aliases limit exposure when a company suffers a data breach and make phishing easier to spot. Protecting email this way strengthens every other cybersecurity resolution.\nBy creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.\nFor recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit Cyberguy.com.\nKurt's key takeaways\nA safer digital life starts with small, consistent decisions. Strong passwords, updates, backups and awareness go a long way. By committing to these cybersecurity resolutions, you set yourself up for a more secure 2026. You also make it harder for criminals to profit from stolen data. There is no better time to start than now.\nWhich of these cybersecurity habits are you still delaying, and what would it take to address them today?
