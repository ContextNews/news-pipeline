Denmark already had a defence agreement with the US that gave it access to Greenland, she said, and Denmark had upped its investment in security in the Arctic region.\n\"I would therefore strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have very clearly said that they are not for sale,\" she said.\nHours later on Air Force One, Trump reiterated the goal. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it,\" he said.\nEarlier the Danish ambassador to the US responded to the post by Mrs Miller - a right-wing podcaster and former aide to Trump during his first term - with a \"friendly reminder\" that the two countries were allies and saying Denmark expected respect for its territorial integrity.\nThe exchange comes after the US carried out a major military operation against Venezuela on Saturday, capturing its president Nicolas Maduro and his wife and removing them to New York.\nTrump later said the US would \"run\" Venezuela and US oil companies would \"start making money for the country\".\nThe US president has previously refused to rule out using force to secure control of Greenland, a vast island in the Arctic.\nTrump has claimed that making it part of the United States would serve US security interests due to its strategic location and its abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors.\nThe Trump administration's recent move to appoint a special envoy to Greenland prompted anger in Denmark.\nGreenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands.\nWhile most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

{"article_id": "46b5162f74fcea09", "source": "bbc", "headline": "The myth of willpower - and why some people struggle to lose weight more than others", "body": "Thousands of genes that have an influence on weight, say experts - which means weight loss isn't a level playing field", "content": "The myth of willpower - and why some people struggle to lose weight more than others\n\"Fat people just need more self-control.\" \"It's about personal responsibility.\" \"It's simple, just eat less.\"\nThese were some of the 1,946 comments, posted by readers, beneath an article I wrote last year about weight-loss injections.\nThe idea that obesity is simply a matter of willpower is held by a great many people - including some medical professionals.\nEight out of 10 people said obesity could be entirely prevented by lifestyle choices alone, according to a study of people in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and the US, which was published in medical journal The Lancet.\nBut Bini Suresh, a dietitian, who has spent 20 years working with obese and overweight patients, is exasperated by the idea.\nThis, she believes, is only a fraction of the picture.\n\"I frequently see patients who are highly motivated, knowledgeable and trying consistently yet still struggling with weight.\"\n\"Terms like 'willpower' and 'self-control' are the wrong words,\" agrees Dr Kim Boyd, medical director at WeightWatchers. \"For decades people have been told to eat less and move more and they will lose weight... [But] obesity is much more complex.\"\nShe and other experts I spoke to suggest there are myriad reasons a person might be obese, some of which are not yet fully understood: but what is clear is that it is not a level playing field.\nThe government has turned to regulation to try to tackle this.\nIts most recent move – banning junk food advertising on television before 9pm and completely for online promotions – comes into effect today.\nYet many think this too will only go so far in tackling what is now an overwhelming obesity problem in the UK - one that affects more than one in four adults.\nA battle against biology\n\"The amount of weight people gain is significantly influenced by their genes and those genes are relevant for everybody,\" explains Prof Sadaf Farooqi, a consultant endocrinologist who treats patients with severe obesity and related endocrine disorders.\nShe says that certain genes affect the brain pathways that regulate hunger and fullness in response to signals sent by the stomach to the brain.\n\"Variants or changes in these genes are found in people with obesity, which means they feel more hungry and are less likely to feel full after eating.\"\nPerhaps the single most important of these genes – at least the most important of those known about so far – is the MC4R gene. A mutation in this gene, which encourages overeating and means we feel less full, is carried by roughly a fifth of the global population.\n\"Other genes affect metabolism – how quickly we burn energy,\" adds Prof Farooqi.\n\"That means some will gain more weight and store fat from eating the same amount of food, than other people do, or they will burn less calories when they exercise.\"\nShe estimates that there are likely to be thousands of genes that have an influence on weight and that we only know in detail about roughly 30 to 40 of them.\nThe science behind yo-yo dieting\nYet even this is only part of the story.\nAndrew Jenkinson, a bariatric surgeon and author of Why We Eat Too Much, explains that everyone has a weight their brain understands or thinks is the right weight for them - regardless of whether it's a healthy weight or not.\nIt's known as set weight point theory.\n\"This [set weight] is determined by genetics, but also by other factors, such as your food environment, stress environment and sleep environment.\"\nAnd it means that body weight is like a thermostat: your body aims to maintain that preferred range. If weight drops below this \"set point\", hunger rises and metabolism slows, just as a thermostat turns up the heat when it's too cold, according to that theory.\nOnce your point is set, it's very difficult to alter it by willpower, Dr Jenkinson argues.\nThis can also explain yo-yo dieting. \"For instance, if you're 20 stone and your brain wants you to be 20 stone and you go on a low calorie diet and lose two stone, your body's reaction to that is just the same as if you were starving,\" he says.\n\"It's going to have that reaction of voracious appetite, food-seeking behaviour and a low metabolism,\" he adds. \"These appetite signals are profoundly strong. They're as strong as a thirst signal, they're there to help us survive…\n\"A voracious appetite is something that's really, really difficult to ignore.\"\nAs to the science behind this, Dr Jenkinson points to the role of leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells. \"It acts as a signal to the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that basically controls your weight set point, to tell [it] how much energy storage the body has.\n\"The hypothalamus will look at the leptin level and if it looks like we're storing too much energy or too much fat, it will automatically alter our behaviour by decreasing our appetite and increasing our metabolism.\"\nAt least that's how leptin should work. Often, it fails, particularly in the Western food environment, he explains.\nThis is because the leptin signal shares a signalling pathway with insulin. \"So if insulin levels are too high, it actually then dilutes the leptin signal and suddenly the brain can't sense how much fat is stored.\"\nThe good news is that this set point isn't fixed – it can shift gradually through sustained lifestyle changes, improved sleep, stress reduction and long-term healthy habits.\nMuch like resetting a thermostat – over time, slow, consistent adjustments can help the body accept a new, healthier range.\nObesity in UK: The perfect storm\nNone of this accounts for the rise in obesity – after all, our genes and the biological makeup of our bodies have not changed.\nThe proportion of adults classified as overweight or obese has steadily risen over the past decade, with the Health Foundation's 2025 analysis indicating that more than 60% of UK adults now fall into this category (including around 28% who are obese).\nPart of this is down to the sheer volume – and affordability – of poor quality, high-calorie foods, and in particular ultra-processed foods. Add to that aggressive marketing and advertising of fast food and sugary drinks, growing portion sizes, and limited opportunities for physical activity (often due to urban design or time pressures), and it makes for a perfect storm.\n\"[As a result] we have become more obese as a population and, of course, those with a greater genetic propensity to put on weight have done so,\" says Prof Farooqi.\nPublic health experts refer to this as the obesogenic environment, a term first used in the 1990s as researchers began linking rising obesity rates to external factors like food availability, marketing, and urban design.\nTogether, many experts argue, these factors create constant cues and pressures toward overeating and inactivity, meaning even highly motivated individuals struggle to maintain a healthy weight.\nBut all of this also explains why willpower has become more of a loaded term too.\nThe personal responsibility debate\nSitting in her office at Newcastle City Council, public health director Alice Wiseman can see food everywhere. \"There are coffee shops, bakeries and takeaways. You can't go to school or work without passing a food place.\n\"Visibility matters – if you pass lots of takeaways on your way to work, you're more likely to buy one. Your body's almost reacting to the food around it.\"\nIn Gateshead, where she is also public health director, planning permission has not been granted to a new hot food takeaway since 2015.\nBut across the wider country, the fast-food and takeaway industry has continued to grow – it is worth more than £23bn a year.\nAnd UK food advertising spend is dominated by products high in fat, salt and sugar, such as confectionery, sugary drinks, fast food, and snacks, according to the latest Ofcom Communications Market Report.\nBut Ms Wiseman suggests the new measures introduced today to restrict TV and online advertising of junk food – or officially \"less healthy food\" – will only go so far.\nA report last year by The Food Foundation also suggested that healthier foods are more than twice as expensive per calorie than less healthy foods.\n\"In families where money is tight it is difficult to afford to eat healthily,\" says Ms Wiseman.\n\"I'm not saying personal responsibility doesn't have a role to play. But when you think about it, you have to ask what has changed? We haven't suddenly got less willpower.\"\nMs Suresh agrees. \"We're living in an environment engineered for over-consumption.\"\n\"Obesity is not a failure of character. It's a complex, chronic condition shaped by biology and a highly obesogenic environment. Willpower alone is not enough and framing weight loss as solely a matter of discipline does harm.\"\nHowever, others have a different take on the word \"willpower\".\nProf Keith Frayn, author of A Calorie is a Calorie, agrees many overweight people would probably not have been so, 40 years ago. \"It is the environment that has changed, not their willpower or anything else,\" he says.\nBut he adds: \"I worry that dismissing 'willpower' makes it too easy to resign oneself to being at a weight that may not be what is desired, or best for health.\"\nHe points to large databases of people who have successfully lost weight and have maintained that weight loss, for example the National Weight Control Registry in the USA, with over 10,000 participants.\n\"Those people describe both losing weight and keeping it off as 'hard', the latter even harder than the former…\n\"I would suggest that if you were to tell those people that willpower has nothing to do with it, they would be quite affronted.\"\n'You can't legislate people into shape'\nThe broader debate, of course, is how much responsibility the state should hold.\nMs Wiseman believes regulation is an important tool in tackling obesity, arguing that promotions such as buy-one-get-one free deals encourage impulse buying. But Gareth Lyon, head of health and social care at right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange, argues that more legislation is not the way forward.\n\"You can't legislate people into shape,\" he says.\n\"Bans and taxes on the foods that people enjoy eating are effective only in making life harder, less enjoyable and more expensive for people at a time when Britain is already struggling with the cost of living.\"\nChristopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs, a right-leaning think tank, also believes that obesity is an \"individual problem\", not a public health one.\n'[Obesity] is because of choices made by that individual,\" he argues. \"So ultimately, you can't go much beyond the individual. I find it a fairly bizarre idea that it's the government's responsibility to make people slimmer.\n\"I'd like to see a serious independent evaluation of these policies and if they don't work they should be repealed.\"\nAs for willpower, this will always play some sort of a role – what varies is the extent to which experts think it does.\nMs Suresh believes it is only one part of a bigger tapestry. And the first step is about educating people about what other factors are at play.\n\"This perspective shifts the focus from a moral judgement about willpower to a compassionate, science-informed support system which ultimately offers better chances for long-term success.\"\nThere are also ways to strengthen willpower, argues Dr Eleanor Bryant, a psychologist at Bradford University. \"It's not constant all the time. It's affected by your mood, how tired you are and, in terms of eating, how hungry you are…\"\nWhat also matters is how you think about it. There are two types of willpower – flexible and rigid. Someone who is rigid sees it as black and white. \"If you succumb to temptation you basically give in. You eat that biscuit and then you carry on eating.\"\nIn psychological terms, this is known as disinhibited eating. \"Whereas, someone who is flexible says, 'OK, I've eaten one biscuit… but I will stop there,'\" says Dr Bryant. \"Needless to say, being flexible is much more successful.\"\nBut she says: \"Exercising willpower with food is probably more difficult than in other areas [of life].\"\nMs Suresh agrees, though she says that once people understand the limits of willpower, their ability to exercise it actually strengthens.\n\"When these patients understand that their struggle is rooted in biology, not lack of discipline, and are supported with structured nutrition, consistent meal patterns, psychological strategies and realistic goals, their relationship with food improves markedly.\"\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

He is not a football fan.\nGrowing up in Greater Manchester, he says his biggest childhood involvement with the sport was through doodling in football-themed colouring books.\n\"In those pre-enlightened days, if they were City players, they were obviously the enemy,\" he says, explaining that his family sided towards United.\n\"Our way of humiliating these City players was to put earrings and lipstick and eyelashes on them as a way of feminising them.\n\"We thought this was an insult, but of course, these days, it's just a choice.\"\nDespite his previous lack of passion for the beautiful game, Coogan is now starring in a new film about midfielder Roy Keane, playing the role of his international manager, Mick McCarthy.\nThe film's title, Saipan, comes from the name of the western Pacific island where the Republic of Ireland went to prepare for the 2002 World Cup.\nWhat followed was the football fallout that divided a nation; Keane disagreeing so vehemently with McCarthy's training camp methods that he quit and went home.\nSome media commentators at the time described the event as a civil war, with friends and families divided between Team McCarthy or Team Keane.\n\"Calling it the Civil War Two is quite funny, but there is definitely some truth in that,\" says Coogan, who like McCarthy is second generation Irish, an aspect of the role that appealed to him.\n\"The Civil War was about how Ireland should conduct itself in relation to the rest of the world and in relation to the British,\" he expounds.\n\"And this is sort of no different.\"\nFor Éanna Hardwicke, who plays Keane, Ireland's pre-World Cup implosion was one of his earliest childhood memories.\n\"I was five, so I was interested in the sticker books more than anything.\n\"I remember being coached by adults, 'This is what you say if anyone asks you about it'.\n\"They were very much Team Mick and I think they were coming at it from the generational side, where it was like, 'That is not the way that you comport yourself, and it's disrespectful.'\"\nCoogan made the decision, before filming started, to call Barnsley-born McCarthy, who as well as managing the Republic of Ireland twice (from 1996-2002 and 2018-2020), was capped 57 times as player.\n\"I wanted to speak to him because I read the script and although it was very good, I felt like it was weighted a bit too heavily towards Roy.\n\"Given that I was playing Mick, I felt like I should sort of be in Mick's corner,\" explains Coogan, who at 60 is 17 years older than McCarthy was in 2002. He can, however, still pull-off the manager's trademark \"pair of shorts\" look, having climbed Mount Kilimanjaro to celebrate his landmark birthday.\n\"He wasn't so anxious that he wasn't happy to talk me,\" continues Coogan. \"But I think he was concerned that it would be too negative to him in a way.\"\nHardwicke decided to take the opposite approach.\n\"I had a very clear sense of what Roy thought about all of this, because so much was written about it and so many interviews were given at the time.\"\nSo, like many a Premier League midfielder in the 90s, he decided to give Roy Keane a wide berth, instead using existing material for his research.\nOne Manchester United-related revelation which Coogan imparts is that, in 1997, he was present at a historic football/pop culture crossover moment.\n\"I was out in Manchester, this was a long time ago, with David Beckham and Ryan Giggs,\" he says.\n\"And I was on a night out after this charity event, the night he met Victoria Beckham.\"\nYes, Coogan was at the genesis of Posh and Becks.\n\"I was sort of there, hovering,\" is his summation of his involvement.\n\"You were his wingman?\" I ask, slightly incredulous at how this detail has only emerged 29 years later.\nHe is now trying to play it down: \"Not really, no. Ryan Giggs was there, too,\" lowering himself one position in the power rankings of Beckham's posse for that evening.\nThen details start to return to him about Beckham's attire. \"I remember he was very trendy. He was wearing a suit with shoes and no socks, a fashionable thing for a young man to do. Has that gone away now?\" he enquires hopefully.\nSo when David was chatting to Victoria, was Coogan left having to make small talk with the other Spice Girls?\n\"No, it wasn't quite like that,\" he reminisces, before the story takes another strange turn.\n\"When I was on tour, someone stole all our musical equipment and the Spice Girls lent me theirs.\"\nThis was around the time of Coogan's Portuguese crooner alter ego, Tony Ferrino.\nI again ask for clarification on what his link with the Spice Girls was.\n\"They were in Manchester at the same time that I was doing gigs. And David Beckham was there, too.\n\"So, you know, I've been around for a while. I've seen a few things.\"\nSaipan opens in cinemas on 23 January.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgzewy42pdo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-05T00:02:40+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

What could it mean for the UK?", "content": "What's behind PM's notable shift on closer ties to Europe?\nThe prime minister's very notable tilt on the UK's ties to the European Union post-Brexit on Saturday was designed to send a message to business, to Brussels and to other European capitals, as well as his backbenchers.\nCloser post-Brexit economic relations are now expected to be looked at as part of an annual process of bilateral talks rather than just at this year's formal review of the UK-EU deal.\nIt was Downing Street's answer to political questions about a more ambitious Brexit reset involving rejoining the customs union with the EU.\nSome Labour backbenchers, union leaders and cabinet ministers have joined calls crystallised by Lib Dem moves in Parliament last year that led to a non-binding vote.\nSir Keir Starmer gave a clear answer to my colleague Laura Kuenssberg that this was not the priority at the moment, as it goes against what he considers one of the successes of the past year: the signing of best-in-class deals on trade with the US and India, with more to come in the Middle East.\nInstead of the customs union, his focus is on a \"closer relationship\" with the single market, which would not mean ripping up those new trade deals elsewhere.\n\"We are better looking to the single market rather than the customs union for our further alignment,\" Sir Keir said.\nWhen the UK formally left the EU in January 2021, Boris Johnson's deal stressed freedom from EU regulations rather than frictionless trade for British exporters across Europe.\nAlready, Sir Keir's \"Brexit reset\" envisages realigning with EU rules in three areas to help the free flow of trade: food and farm exports, electricity, and emissions trading.\nThe British Chambers of Commerce last month published a list of further requests in other sectors to help exporters deal with post-Brexit red tape that has hit the trade of goods.\nIt reported a majority of 989 business members in its own survey agreed that the UK-EU trade deal was not helping sales growth.\nA number of other areas could, feasibly, see a similar approach - alignment with single market rules - in exchange for reducing post Brexit barriers across manufacturing, in automotive, chemicals, or for example in arrangements for VAT.\nEuropean capitals were underwhelmed by the lack of ambition in last year's reset, with the British rejection of some experts who floated the idea of the virtual readmission of British goods to the single market.\nThe detail of arrangements on electricity, and food and farm standards is yet to be finalised. A plan for UK manufacturers to be part of the €150bn (£131bn) Security Action For Europe defence loan fund has stalled over the size of the membership fee, after some objections from France. Canada has joined the scheme.\nThe UK has agreed a deal to rejoin the Erasmus university exchange and further negotiate a youth jobs scheme. This has helped clear the way for further UK-EU talks.\nSome UK insiders say the publication of the US National Security Strategy (NSS) last month has also changed the context on UK relations with Europe.\nThe NSS said the US would \"cultivate resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\" and praised the \"growing influence of patriotic European parties\".\nIn Downing Street, there is some recognition that even this rapidly changing world has changed again.\nDomestically, too, Labour expect to be outflanked on Brexit not just by the Liberal Democrats, but also the Green Party, which is targeting Labour's London heartlands in council elections in May.\nThe prime minister's words yesterday are borne of a confluence of economics, politics and geopolitics as the UK starts a year that will mark the 10th anniversary of the Brexit referendum.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62vzmle530o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-05T07:18:41+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Luke Skywalker would have been better at holding a line and length.\nIn Perth and Brisbane, England's philanthropy allowed Australia to reach 100 in 16.3 overs and then 17.2 overs - both in the top five for quickest they have reached three figures in 140 years of Ashes Tests.\nThis effort - 100-1 in 20.3 overs - was not far behind.\nAgain, England's length was the obvious failing.\nBrydon Carse and Matthew Potts set the tone with a wayward first six overs which included seven fours - all of them to cuts and pulls.\nPotts and Carse bowled 47% of their deliveries shorter than 8m in the first six overs, compared to 19% by Australia across the same period on day one.\nPotts, playing his first match of the series, ended the day with 0-58 from seven overs. Carse, as he has throughout the series, has been hit at more than four runs per over though Jake Weatherald was dropped off his bowling.\nStokes pinned Weatherald lbw in the 13th over and he and Josh Tongue brought brief control but Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne were still able to combine for 105 runs in 113 balls for the second wicket.\nAustralia have scored a boundary every 13.4 balls in this series, already below the recent global average of one every 15.1 balls.\nAcross this innings, Australia have hit the ball to the rope once every 7.2 deliveries.\n\"It can't be planning,\" said Tufnell. \"I think now it is coming down to ability. I don't know whether they have got it.\n\"I don't understand why professional bowlers can't run up and try to hit the top of off stump six out of six. You're the best we've got.\n\"They haven't been able to string any sort of pressure [together]. Put the sheet of A4 down and hit that. They have been all over the place. I can't believe it.\"\nWhy is Stokes not opening the bowling?\nThis was the first time Carse has taken the first over of an innings in his 63-match first-class career, a move influenced by England's selections for the tour and the injuries to Jofra Archer and Gus Atkinson.\nCarse does not take the new ball for his county, Durham, but England have given him that role in every innings since the start of the third Test.\nThe tactic again denied Tongue, England's best pace bowler in the series, the use of the new ball.\nAcross his full first-class career, Tongue averages 27 in his first spell with the new ball. Carse has taken five wickets at 82.\nThe other option would be for Ben Stokes to begin himself - something he has been reluctant to do throughout his time as captain.\nEngland's captain has only opened the bowling twice in his Test career - in Ahmedabad against India in 2021 and Rawalpindi against Pakistan in 2022 - but his reluctance is curious given the specifics of this series.\nAustralia have two left-handed openers in Head and Weatherald and Stokes has the best average against southpaws of all of the England quicks still standing.\n\"That is why I get so frustrated with this leadership group,\" former England captain Michael Vaughan said on Test Match Special.\n\"It is almost like 'we don't care about anything that has been before'.\n\"Data and information is not everything but when you have got an opening bowler who doesn't open the bowling, who when he does averages 80, why is he bowling?\"\nWhere do England go from here?\nStokes' fitness record is one obvious caveat.\nIt is less than three weeks since he did not bowl at all during a day's play in Adelaide to protect his body.\nExpecting him to become England's full-time opening bowler as well as captaining and batting may be optimistic.\nBut this series - in which Australia have scored 30% of their runs on the cuts and pulls - is a worrying hint to England's future.\nThe days of James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes are gone with all three having retired. Mark Wood, who was ruled out of this series after one match, has said he will try to make another return but that feels unlikely.\nIn conditions that were expected to suit them, these are the bowlers England now have. There are few in the domestic game who could be picked with confidence of success.\nArcher looks a banker for the coming years if his fitness allows.\nOutside of that? Carse is struggling and Atkinson is not living up to the promise of his first 10 Tests which returned 48 wickets.\nAlarms are ringing about England's bowling future.\nRelated topics\n- Published1 hour ago\n- Published23 hours ago\n- Published5 hours ago", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cpqy973jx5no?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-05T08:19:38+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

All I kept on thinking is 'I can't live like this'. It was horrific.\n\"I just knew I either wasn't going to survive this process or I was just going to stay in my house forever.\"\nMs King was told by parole officers that Butcher had a \"human right\" to return home, but she felt the needs of her sister's killer were being prioritised over hers.\n\"Initially we had a very small area, we're talking feet around your house and your workplaces and schools,\" she explained.\n\"We were already saving [money] for that worst case scenario, that we would have to leave.\n\"But we shouldn't be the ones having to live elsewhere and trying to rebuild back our lives, yet again.\"\nButcher was eventually given a 2.5 mile (4km) exclusion zone, but Ms King says that was still not enough reassurance to allow her to \"live freely\".\n\"Seeing the email drop to say that this is going be looked at in Parliament really hit home, and it felt like my fight was over,\" she added.\nThe new restriction zones are part of the Sentencing Bill 2025, which is currently under consideration in Parliament.\nPresently, serious sexual and violent offenders can be ordered upon release not to enter the area where their victim lives.\nBut under the new plans, the onus would shift to confining the offender to specific areas tailored to them.\nThese zones are created with input from probation officers and victims, aiming to protect survivors by shifting the burden of restriction from victims to offenders.\nUpon release from prison, perpetrators will be electronically tagged for real-time monitoring, with any breaches leading to potential recall.\nA Ministry of Justice (MoJ) spokesperson said: \"We must protect victims, which is why new restriction zones will curb the freedoms of the most serious violent and sexual offenders and give victims the peace of mind they deserve.\"\nCo-campaigner Carole Gould, whose 17-year-old daughter was murdered her ex-boyfriend, says it is a \"big relief\" that she will not have to fear crossing paths with her killer.\n\"It's like a cloud lifted off our shoulders,\" she said.\n\"It means we can stay in the area if we chose to and we aren't being forced to leave.\"\nThomas Griffiths admitted stabbing Ellie Gould to death at her home in Calne, Wiltshire, in May 2019 after their three-month relationship ended.\nGriffiths had walked out of school, driven to Ellie's home, and attempted to strangle her before stabbing her 13 times in the neck and face with a knife taken from the kitchen.\nHe pleaded guilty to her murder and was handed a life sentence with a minimum of 12-and-a-half years. He will be eligible for parole in May 2032.\nMs Gould said his time served has gone by \"too fast\" - meanwhile she has spent the last six years fighting to improve protection for victims and their families.\nShe said Griffiths's parents \"still only live up the road\", just a few miles away.\n\"The thought of him getting out is huge anyway, but the thought of him then also being allowed to come back into Wiltshire, it's like a double blow,\" she said.\n\"It would be like he's won again.

BBC News has not independently verified that report.\nIn the days following the capture of Maduro, questions have been raised over whether the Trump administration could consider a similar operation against Cuba, which, like Venezuela, has had decades of adversarial relations with the US.\nSpeaking to reporters on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said military action would not be necessary because \"Cuba is ready to fall\".\nHe continued: \"I don't think we need any action. Looks like it's going down.

She described the approach as unprecedented in modern times.\nIn his news conference, President Trump said that the US was \"ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so\", which appears to explain why he thinks that Delcy Rodríguez has no choice but to do the US's bidding.\nThe fact that Rodríguez was seen surrounded by some of the most powerful men in Maduro's inner circle hours after the president had been arrested and flown out of the country seems to suggest that she has won their backing, too.\nFlanking her were her brother Jorge Rodríguez, who is the president of Venezuela's National Assembly, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino and the top commander of the armed forces, Domingo Hernández Lárez, among others.\nThis will have pleased US officials concerned that the capture of Maduro would lead to a potentially destabilising battle for control among his inner circle.\nBut the message Delcy Rodríguez had for the US would have been less pleasing to US ears.\nShe insisted that \"there is only one president in Venezuela, and his name is Nicolás Maduro\" and called his seizure \"a kidnapping\".\n\"We will never again be a colony of any empire,\" she insisted, promising to \"defend\" Venezuela.\nWhile she certainly did not sound like the person Trump had described as \"willing to do the US's bidding\", there has been speculation that she may have struck a nationalistic note to keep Maduro's most loyal supporters on board.\nQuizzed about Trump's support for Rodríguez and her remarks, Marco Rubio told CBS on Sunday that the US would make an assessment based on her actions, not her words.\n\"Do I know what decisions people are going to make? I don't,\" he added, seemingly implying that he was not as certain of Rodríguez's willingness to work with the US as Trump.\nWhat he was adamant about was the US's willingness to pressure Rodríguez's interim government.\n\"I do know this, that if they don't make the right decisions, the United States will retain multiple levers of leverage to ensure that our interests are protected, and that includes the oil quarantine that's in place, among other things,\" he said.\nIn an interview with ABC, Rubio also appeared to suggest that fresh elections should be held in Venezuela.\n\"Government will come about through a period of transition and real elections, which they have not had,\" he told This Week.\nHe also appealed for \"realism\", suggesting that fresh elections would take time: \"Everyone's asking, why 24 hours after Nicolas Maduro was arrested, there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow? That's absurd.\"\nJohn Bolton, who worked on plans to remove Venezuela's president when he was national security adviser in Trump's first term, welcomed the US military operation and Maduro's capture.\nHowever, the prominent Trump critic told the BBC it was unlikely Rodriguez would bend the knee to the US, particularly as the regime still had backing from China, Russia and Cuba.\n\"The rational thing to do here is bring down what's left of the Maduro regime and put the opposition in power pending free and fair elections. They have people capable of running an interim administration while elections are set up.\"\nTalk of fresh elections will no doubt disappoint not only María Corina Machado and Edmundo González but also many of the Venezuelans who voted for them and who have been adamant that they want to see those votes honoured.\nThe opposition has long insisted that free and fair elections are not possible while the key institutions involved in organising them are stacked with Maduro loyalists. A reform of those bodies will take time.\nIn the short term, therefore, Venezuela looks likely to be governed by Delcy Rodríguez and Maduro's inner circle - as long as they meet the Trump administration's expectations.\nHow long that may last will depend on whether Rodríguez can find a golden middle between accommodating Trump's requests and the Maduro base interests.\nShe may soon find herself between a rock and a hard place.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgx0ylzy8vo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-04T23:47:35+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

On his orders the US has Maduro behind bars and now will \"run\" Venezuela.\nThe US president made the announcement in a remarkable news conference with enormous implications for US foreign policy worldwide at his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago. Trump said the US would be in charge in Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\".\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio, he said, had spoken to the Venezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez, who had told him \"we'll do whatever you need... She, I think, was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice\".\nTrump was light on detail. He said that \"we're not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to have [them]\".\nBut does he believe that he can govern Venezuela by remote control? Will this demonstration that he will back words with military action, praised lavishly at Mar-a-Lago by both Marco Rubio and the US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, be enough to reshape Venezuela and browbeat Latin American leaders into compliance?\nIt sounded as if he believes something like that.\nThe evidence is that it will not be easy or smooth.\nThe respected think tank, the International Crisis Group, warned in October that the fall of Maduro could lead to violence and instability in Venezuela.\nThe same month The New York Times reported that defence and diplomatic officials in the first Trump administration had war-gamed what might happen if Maduro fell. Their conclusion was the prospect of violent chaos as armed factions competed for power.\nThe removal and incarceration of Nicolás Maduro is a remarkable assertion of American military power.\nThe US assembled a massive armada and achieved its goal without losing a single American life.\nMaduro had ignored the will of the Venezuelan people by sweeping aside his own electoral defeat and, without question, his departure will be welcomed by many of its citizens.\nBut the implications of the US action will reverberate forward, way beyond Venezuela's borders.\nThe mood at the Mar-a-Lago news conference was triumphalist, as they celebrated what was undoubtedly a textbook operation carried out by highly professional US forces.\nThe military operation is only the first stage.\nAmerica's record of achieving regime change by force in the last 30 years is disastrous.\nThe political follow-up is what makes or breaks the process.\nIraq descended into a bloody catastrophe after the US invasion in 2003. In Afghanistan two decades and billions of dollars' worth of attempted nation-building were swept away in days after the US pulled out in 2021.\nNeither country was in America's backyard.\nYet the ghosts of interventions past in Latin America - and the threat of others yet to come - are scarcely more promising.\nTrump tried out a new nickname, the Donroe Doctrine, for the declaration made by President James Monroe in 1823 warning other powers not to meddle in America's sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere.\n\"The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot,\" Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. \"Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the Western hemisphere will never be questioned again.\"\nHe said that the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, had to \"watch his ass\".\nLater he told Fox News that \"something's going to have to be done with Mexico\".\nCuba is undoubtedly also on the US agenda, which is being driven by Rubio, whose parents are Cuban-Americans.\nThe US has a long record of armed intervention in Latin America.\nI was in Haiti in 1994 when President Bill Clinton sent in 25,000 troops and two aircraft carriers to enforce regime change. Then, the Haitian regime crumbled without a shot being fired. Far from ushering in a better future, the 30 years since then have been a period of almost unbroken misery for the Haitian people. Haiti is now a failed state dominated by armed gangs.\nDonald Trump talked of making Venezuela great again, but not about democracy. He dismissed the idea that the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, should lead the country.\n\"I think it'd be very tough for her to be the leader, she doesn't have the support... She doesn't have the respect.\"\nHe did not mention Edmundo González, who many Venezuelans believe was the rightful winner of the 2024 elections.\nInstead, the US, for the time being anyway, is backing Maduro's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez.\nWhile there must have been some kind of internal collusion that gave the US military the inside knowledge it needed to remove Maduro, the regime created by his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, appears to be intact.\nIt is unlikely that the Venezuelan armed forces, despite any humiliation its generals might feel about their inability to oppose the US attack, will acquiesce with US plans.\nThe military and the regime's civilian supporters have enriched themselves through networks of corruption that they will not want to lose.\nCivilian militias have been armed by the regime, and Venezuela has other armed groups.\nThey include criminal networks, as well as Colombian guerrillas who backed the Maduro regime in return for sanctuary.\nThe US intervention in Venezuela brings into stark focus some of the well springs of Trump's worldview.\nHe makes no secret of the way he covets the mineral wealth of other countries.\nHe has already attempted to extract profit from Ukraine's natural resources in return for military assistance.\nTrump does not hide his desire to control Venezuela's huge mineral reserves, and his belief that US oil companies were robbed when the oil industry was nationalised.\n\"We're going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground, and that wealth is going to the people of Venezuela, and people from outside of Venezuela that used to be in Venezuela, and it goes also to the United States of America in the form of reimbursement.\"\nThat will deepen the fears in Greenland and Denmark that he will look north as well as south.\nThe US has not dropped its desire to absorb Greenland, for its strategic position in the Arctic as well as the natural resources that are becoming more accessible as its ice melts due to global warming.\nThe Maduro operation also amounts to another serious blow to the idea that the best way to run the world is to follow an agreed set of rules, as laid out in international law.\nThe idea was tattered before Donald Trump took office, but he has already demonstrated repeatedly both in the US and internationally that he believes he can ignore laws he doesn't like.\nEuropean allies, who are desperate not to anger him, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are wrestling with ways to say that they support the idea of international law without condemning the fact that the Maduro operation is a blatant violation of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe US justification that its military was simply aiding the execution of an arrest warrant for a drug lord masquerading as Venezuela's president is thin, especially given Trump's declarations that the US will now control the country and its oil industry.\nA few hours before Maduro and his wife were seized, he met Chinese diplomats at his palace in Caracas.\nChina condemned the US action. It said \"hegemonic acts of the US seriously violate international law and Venezuela's sovereignty and threaten peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region\".\nThe US should \"stop violating other countries' sovereignty and security\".\nEven so, China might see a precedent set by the US action.\nIt regards Taiwan as a breakaway province and has declared that returning it to control of Beijing is a national priority.\nIn Washington, that is certainly the fear of the Democratic vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner. He issued a statement saying China's leaders, and others, will be watching closely.\n\"If the United States asserts the right to use military force to invade and capture foreign leaders it accuses of criminal conduct, what prevents China from claiming the same authority over Taiwan's leadership? What stops [Russian President] Vladimir Putin from asserting similar justification to abduct Ukraine's president? Once this line is crossed, the rules that restrain global chaos begin to collapse, and authoritarian regimes will be the first to exploit it.\"\nDonald Trump seems to believe that he makes the rules, and what applies to the US under his command does not mean others can expect the same privileges.\nBut that is not how the world of power works.\nHis actions at the start of 2026 point to another 12 months of global turbulence.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y45nyz124o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-04T15:14:35+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Pictures show Fuerte Tiuna on fire, with huge flames visible for miles.\nVenezuelans have described how US military helicopters flew low over Caracas, heading for Fuerte Tiuna.\nSome of the helicopters came under fire, but were still able to fly, Gen Caine said.\n\"It was a lot of gunfire,\" Trump added.\nOnce on the ground, troops from the US Army's Delta Force, an elite special forces unit, moved quickly.\nThey gained access to the compound at 02:01 local time, and the Maduros \"gave up\" without a struggle, Gen Caine said.\nBut Trump gave more details. The Maduros tried to escape into a safe place, the US president explained, describing it as a military \"fortress\".\n\"The safe place is all steel, and he wasn't able to make it to the door because our guys were so fast.\n\"It was a very thick door, a very heavy door,\" Trump told reporters. \"He made it to the door.

It has more than paid off.", "content": "Sound of 2026: Reluctant rockers Royel Otis tipped for success\nAussie guitar duo Royel Otis show up to our interview looking artfully crumpled, beers in hand - but all is not quite what it seems.\nThe band - made up of twenty-somethings Royel Maddell (guitar) and Otis Pavlovic (lead vocals, guitar) - are on a rare day off. Last night, they played the last of three sold-out concerts at London's Brixton Academy. It was their 81st gig of the year.\nThey're dishevelled because they've just got off a bus to Glasgow, ahead of show 82. The beers are alcohol-free Guinness.\n\"We're learning how to look after ourselves [on tour],\" says Maddell. \"We just try to stay healthy and hit the saunas. Try to stay sober. Hence the Guinness.\"\nIt's a new level of professionalism for a band that never really intended to become a major touring act.\nBut Royel Otis's cosmic, sun-kissed indie anthems (and a viral cover of Murder On The Dancefloor) have put them on the map - and earned them fifth place on BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2026.\nThey were voted onto the list, which highlights the emerging artists who could make a mainstream breakthrough in the coming year, by an international panel of more than 170 DJs, producers and artists - including Sir Elton John, who has championed the band on his radio show.\nIn previous years, fifth place has gone to the likes of Rosalía, Central Cee and George Ezra - putting Royel Otis in rarified air.\n\"We feel honoured,\" says Maddell, while admitting that, as Australians, \"it's the first we've heard of the list\".\n\"We're learning about it as we go. But it seems amazing. We're in good company.\"\nRoyel Otis formed in 2019 but, by all accounts, should have started years earlier.\nBoth musicians lived and worked in Byron Bay, New South Wales. They hung out on the same beaches, stayed in the same holiday homes, and Maddell's dad was friends with Pavlovic's uncle.\nIn the end, however, they were introduced by their girlfriends.\n\"Roy was working at a bar that we'd go to sometimes and [we] just ended up playing pool, talking about music. It was pretty straightforward,\" says Pavlovic.\n\"Otis had a demo of a song, and I said, 'Send it to me',\" says Maddell, picking up the story.\n\"I thought it was going to be horrible, because they usually are – but the next morning, I played it while I was in the shower, and I was like, 'Oh, this is sick'.\"\nMaddell sent back some music of his own and the pair quickly started exchanging ideas. For the elder of the two musicians, it marked an abrupt change of plans.\n\"I wanted to be behind the scenes, writing music for someone else,\" confesses Maddell.\nInstead, they went straight to the studio, riffing on their shared love of The Cure, Oasis and - rather brilliantly - the Alessi Brothers' 1976 soft rock classic Seabird.\nThey quickly found a sound of their own. Summed up by Pavlovic as \"jangly guitars and chanted layered vocals\", it's both richly harmonic and somewhat ramshackle - born of a decision to embrace spontaneity and leave studio mistakes intact.\nThey finessed the formula on 2021 single Bull Breed - \"the story of a reckless night out\", gambling away their pay cheques and smoking \"all the cigarettes... like Courtney Love.\"\n\"I don't know if it's celebrating those nights or taking the piss,\" laughs Maddell.\n\"Like betting on horses - we don't do that stuff, but we know the kind of lairy groups that do.\"\nBreakthrough single Oysters In My Pockets is equally rambunctious.\nDescribed on release as \"our way of showing appreciation to the bivalve molluscs that put some boost in our juice and some fire in the libido\", the duo literally wrote the song over \"a barbecue and a few beers\" after visiting the local supermarket to stock up on shellfish.\nIt's one of a number of songs in their discography - see also Fried Rice, Egg Beater, Kool Aid and Jazz Burger - seemingly inspired by food.\n\"We just try to be honest,\" laughs Pavlovic. \"If there's food on our minds, there's food on our minds.\"\n'A sexy sword'\nThose early singles built significant buzz, but the duo weren't ready to commit to a career.\n\"We just wanted to record music. We didn't want to be a touring band,\" says Maddell, who credits their manager, Andrew Klippel, with pushing them to think bigger.\n\"We needed a bit of persuading,\" agrees Pavlovic. \"I think if we had it our way, we probably wouldn't be where we are.\"\nEven today, Maddell does his best to keep his identity hidden, permanently hiding his face behind his tousled, neon pink fringe and using an assumed name (he was born Leroy Bressington).\n\"I still feel a bit nervous,\" he says, despite selling more than 100,000 concert tickets last year - 60,000 of them in the US alone.\nMany of those fans got their first taste of Royel Otis through two viral radio sessions.\nThe first, recorded in January 2024, put a nostalgic indie spin on Sophie Ellis Bextor's Murder On The Dancefloor.\nFour months later, a cover of The Cranberries' Linger for Sirius XM entered the US Top 100 and became the band's biggest song on Spotify, with 223 million plays.\nThe song choice \"was a spur of the moment thing\", says Maddell.\n\"I remember our drummer at the time was like, 'You can't do that. There are just certain songs you don't touch'.\"\nAdopting the time-honoured tradition of ignoring anything your drummer says, they pushed ahead.\nEven so, says Pavlovic, \"it took us three attempts to get it right\".\n\"We were terrified,\" says Maddell. \"We thought it was going to be horrible.\"\nInstead, Linger has become a permanent fixture of their live shows. Last month, they even got to perform it with Cranberries guitarist Noel Hogan in London.\n\"He was such a gentleman,\" says Maddell. \"He wanted to do our version of the song more than he wanted to do his own.\"\nHow does it feel to have the covers eclipse their own material?\n\"They're kind of like our biggest songs, which is bittersweet,\" says Maddell. \"But we're just appreciative that so many people who would never have heard our band discovered us with those covers.\n\"So it's a double-edged sword, but it's a sexy sword.\"\nAnyone who digs further will discover more musical treasures. Since 2024, Royel Otis have recorded two albums at breakneck speed.\nTheir full-length debut, Pratts & Pain (named after a London pub), saw the band experiment with \"crazy, makeshift instruments\" and \"weird open tunings\" without sacrificing their wavy guitar sound and feel-good melodies.\nThe follow-up, 2025's Hickey, was written as their careers took off - and their relationships suffered.\n\"Because we toured the whole of 2024, there were a few people that both of us had to say goodbye to,\" says Pavlovic.\n\"I had to break up with my girlfriend because she just wasn't handling being always alone while I was off travelling the world,\" adds Maddell.\n\"But I also had some family members pass, so a lot of goodbyes happened at the start of this year and last year [2025 and 2024]. You just miss so much of your personal life when you tour so much.\"\nThey admit they had to be talked into making a second album so soon.\n\"In this day and age, there's a pressure to keep going and constantly release new stuff,\" says Pavlovic. \"Everyone has their own opinions about that [but] I don't think that's necessarily the best thing to do.\"\nPerhaps as a result, the album campaign got off to a shaky start, with the band issuing an apology for the seemingly misogynistic lyrics of the lead single, Moody.\nBut after acclaimed debuts at the Glastonbury and Reading festivals (where Sophie Ellis Bextor made a guest appearance), Hickey gave the band their first UK chart entry, and earned Royel Otis nominations for best group and best rock album at Australia's Aria Awards.\nStarting the year on Radio 1's Sound of 2026 list suggests there won't be much let-up, no matter how frazzled the band seem to be.\n\"We've been on the bus, basically, for the last two years,\" says Pavlovic. \"We've got January off, then I want to start work on writing new music and stuff.\n\"But I think I'd like to take a little bit longer. Live a little bit, so I'm not just writing about being on the road.\"\nBy our estimates, that means we can expect the band's musical tribute to low alcohol beer by about October.\nOne act from the top five of the BBC's Sound of 2026 will be announced on Radio 1 and BBC News every day this week, culminating with the winner on Friday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl825nz9nlo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-05T07:02:28+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

After the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, the government went on a large recruitment drive within the French intelligence agencies.\nIt asked Sciences Po, one of France's leading universities, to come up with a new course to both train potential new spies, and provide continuous training for current agents.\nLarge French companies were also quick to show an interest, both in getting their security staff onto the course, and snapping up many of the younger graduates.\nThe diploma is made up of 120 hours of classwork with modules spread over four months. For external students – the spies and those on placement from businesses – it costs around €5,000 ($5,900; £4,400).\nThe core aim of the course is to identify threats wherever they are, and how to track and overcome them. The key topics include the economics of organized crime, Islamic jihadism, business intelligence gathering and political violence.\nTo attend one of the classes and speak to the students I had to be vetted first by the French security services. The theme of the lesson I joined was \"intelligence and over-reliance on technology\".\nOne of the students I speak to is a man in his 40s who goes by the name Roger. He tells me in very precise, clipped English that he is investment banker. He adds: \"I provide consultancy across west Africa, and I joined the course to provide risk assessments to my clients there.\"\nProf Crettiez, who teaches political radicalisation, says there has been a huge expansion in the French secret services in recent years. And that there are now around 20,000 agents in what he called the \"inner circle\".\nThis is made up of the DGSE, which looks at matters overseas, and is the French equivalent of the UK's MI6 or the US's CIA. And the DGSI, which focuses on threats within France, like the UK's MI5 or the US's FBI.\nBut he says it's not just about terrorism. \"There are the two main security agencies, but also Tracfin an intelligence agency which specializes in money laundering.\n\"It is preoccupied with the surge in mafia activity, especially in southern France, including corruption in the public and private sectors mainly due to massive profits in illegal drug trafficking.\"\nOther lecturers on the course include a DGSE official once located in Moscow, a former French ambassador to Libya, and a senior official from Tracfin. The head of security at the French energy giant EDF also runs one module.\nThe private sector's interest in the diploma is said to be continuing to grow. Big businesses, especially in the defence and aerospace sector, but also French luxury goods firms, are increasingly keen to hire the students as they face relentless cybersecurity and spying threats as well as sabotage.\nRecently graduates have been snapped up by the French mobile phone operator Orange, aerospace and defence giant Thales, and LVHM, which owns everything from Louis Vuitton and Dior to champagne brands Dom Perignon and Krug.\nTwenty eight students are enrolled in this year's class. Six are spies. You can tell who they are, as they are the ones huddled together during class breaks, away from the young students, and not too overwhelmed with joy when I approach them.\nWithout saying their exact roles, and with arms crossed, one says the course is considered a fast-track stepping stone for a promotion from the office to field work. Another says he gets fresh ideas being in this academic environment. They signed the day's attendance form with just their first names.\nOne of the younger students, Alexandre Hubert, 21, says he wanted a deeper understanding of the looming economic war between Europe and China. \"Looking at intelligence gathering from a James Bond viewpoint is not relevant, the job is analysing risk and working out how to counteract it,\" he tells me.\nAnother class member, Valentine Guillot, also 21, says she was inspired by the popular, fictional French TV spy drama Le Bureau. \"Coming here to discover this world which I didn't know anything about except for the TV series has been a remarkable opportunity, and now I am very keen to join the security services.\"\nNearly half of the students in the class are in fact women. And this is a relatively recent development according to one of the lecturers, Sebastien-Yves Laurent, a specialist on technology in spying.\n\"Women's interest in intelligence gathering is new,\" he says. \"They are interested because they think it will provide for a better world.\n\"And if there is one common thread amongst all these young students it's that they are very patriotic and that is new compared to 20 years ago.\nIf you are keen to apply to get on the course, French citizenship is an essential requirement, although some dual citizens are accepted.\nYet Prof Crettiez says he has to be wary. \"I regularly get applications from very attractive Israeli and Russian women with amazing CVs. Unsurprisingly they are binned immediately.\"\nIn a recent group photo of the class you can immediately tell who the spies are - they had their backs to the camera.\nWhile all the students and professional spies I met are trim and athletic, Prof Crettiez is also keen to dispel the myth of James Bond-like adventure.\n\"Few new recruits will end up in the field,\" he says. \"Most French intelligence agencies jobs are desk bound.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98nqeqnylro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-05T00:02:00+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The paper acknowledges that a US invasion of Greenland is unlikely, but adds that the renewed threat may alarm European leaders.\nThe Guardian tells its readers that the prospect of the US seizing direct control of Venezuela appears to be receding after Trump's warnings to the interim president, Delcy Rodríguez. It describes the operation to depose Madura as a 'distorted fever dream' which was made real by Trump's return to power.\nA number of theories about the seizure of Maduro are highlighted by the Times. His son, Nicolas Ernesto Maduro Guerra, a Venezeulan congressman, is quoted voicing suspicions it was an inside job and that \"history will tell who the traitors were\". Eva Bolinger, the biographer of the country's former leader, Hugo Chavez, alleges that President Trump made a deal with Rodriguez and \"everything else is just noise\".\nDomestic reaction to events in Venezuela is the focus of The Daily Mail, which claims Labour is \"tearing itself apart\" because Sir Keir Starmer has refused to describe the attack as illegal. It says the Prime Minister is under increasing pressure from left-wing MPs to criticise the US. Sir Keir initially said he wanted to establish the facts before adding that the government would \"shed no tears\" over the end of the Maduro Regime.\nThe Daily Express claims Sir Keir Starmer is plotting what it calls a \"full blown Brexit betrayal\" by edging the UK closer to the EU single market. The I Paper's take is that his push for a \"softer Brexit\" is an attempt to appease what it calls \"unruly\" Labour MPs posing a threat to his leadership.

Microplastics in your brain\n\"We did an episode on microplastics\", says Xand, \"where we talked about a scientific paper that estimated there was about a spoon's worth of microplastic in your brain\".\nChris says this equates in his mind to a couple of Lego bricks.\nXand says this theory was \"carefully debunked\" by expert Dr Stephanie Wright, who said the methods were \"hugely overestimating\" the amount of plastic in the brain.\nSome research on microplastics has suggested plastic particles can absorb environmental toxins and carry heavy metals, whilst there are also concerns that chemicals in plastic can interact with hormones in the body.\nThe brothers say that they have come to the conclusion that there is no point worrying about the amount of plastics you are exposed to because they are \"everywhere\".\nChris says \"our clothes have got plastic, our homes have got plastic, our food is wrapped in plastic and even if you get all the plastic out of your life, your water is still flowing through plastic tubes or carried in plastic bottles\".\nHe adds he went into the podcast recording thinking he would \"ditch my chopping board, buy cotton or wool clothing\" and instead he has realised it's everywhere and there is nothing he can do personally about it.\n2. Eating more protein\nProtein is vitally important in the body for growth, repair and maintenance of cells in the body and for protecting our muscles, bones and skin whilst it also plays a part in supporting the immune system and producing hormones.\nIt's a health trend, food producers have cottoned onto.\nThere is \"nothing you can't buy that doesn't have added protein in.\n\"In everyday life people ask me about protein all the time, even my 16-year-old son talks about getting more protein,\" says Xand.\nXand says it is important to note that adding the word \"protein\" to products is more about profit than health.\n\"A health claim of 'high protein' doesn't mean you're getting a better product,\" he warns.\nHe says some young people in particular are increasing their protein intake \"to look good in the gym\" but says this is\"expensive and unnecessary\" and instead we should worry less about protein consumption and instead focus on a balanced diet that includes fibre.\nIf you want to perform well in the gym, \"The best thing you can do is eat lots of healthy, whole and minimally processed food,\" says Chris.\nThe doctors say there is also \"no evidence\" that isolated protein powders are effective either.\n3. Taking magnesium supplements\nMagnesium is used to maintain nerve and muscle function in the body, keep the heart beating steadily and regulate blood sugar levels.\nWhilst preparing for their episode on magnesium the pair scrolled through lots of enthusiasts on social media who were \"aggressively promoting\" supplements.\n\"There was simply no problem that magnesium could not fix,\" Chris jokes.\nXand says that it is easy to get sucked into thinking that your health problems are caused by magnesium deficiency, but as a species we have \"evolved to use lots\" of magnesium we absorb and as a result \"don't need to worry about it\".\nThe key thing to remember, he says, is \"magnesium is abundant in our diet and we are getting enough of it\".\nXand says it is very easy to get absorbed in social media influencers or what newspapers are saying about magnesium, but now he chooses to ignore it.\n\"It is about tuning out the noise and not being distracted by headlines,\" he adds.\nChris adds that doing this podcast has \"strengthened my desire to reassure people who are anxious, which is most of us in the age of social media\".\n\"There is so much about our bodies that we should not and do not need to worry about.\nUltimately Chris says his aim is to remind listeners \"to believe their bodies are strong and functional\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgklkngn1qo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-05T00:01:24+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Residents speak of their pain but also of their resolve to support one another and the families affected.\nThe contrast is as stark as the wind driving snow into the faces of rescuers - wrapped-up families carrying buckets and spades heading to the beach to build snowmen, as weary coastguard officials in blue overalls and hi-vis jackets search for a missing person.\nOn Friday, two people died after being pulled from the water at Withernsea - a town with a population of just 6,500.\nThe victims were 67-year-old Mark Ratcliffe, who died trying to save the others, and 45-year-old Sarah Keeling.\nHer daughter, Grace Keeling,15, remains missing, although HM Coastguard confirmed the sea search for them was called off at 16:00 GMT on Saturday.\nFrom our vantage point next to the castellated entrance to a former pier, which was destroyed by storms and ship collisions in the late 19th Century, the Reverend Clive Hall, from the town's St Matthew's Church, also spots the families on the promenade.\n\"Withernsea is a fun place,\" he says.\n\"It's a place people come to enjoy themselves, even in winter. It's a lot smaller and quieter than Bridlington further up the coast.\n\"We are very close-knit here. But now we have tears and heartbreak. The mood is sombre.\"\nMr Hall tells me how the town's five churches have come together, with clergy converging on Withernsea Methodist Church, which has become the focus for prayers.\nOn Sunday, services reflected the town's loss.\n\"People are already talking about a special service. That will be something to consider at a later point,\" Mr Hall says.\nAngie Smith, 51, from Hull, is walking with her family. She too associates Withernsea with happy memories.\n\"It's always been a happy little seaside town,\" she says.\n\"What an awful start to the year this is.\n\"Like us, those people [those who died] will have gone to the seaside for a walk and then this happened.\nDarrin Stevens' photographs showing the initial search and rescue efforts have been widely published.\nNow, he stands - without a camera - on the promenade, reflecting on events, as a woman lays a bouquet of flowers.\n\"The balcony of my home overlooks the sea,\" he says, pointing to it.\n\"Within minutes, all I could see was a wall of flashing blue lights.\"\nMr Stevens did not see anyone in the water, with the seawall saving him from witnessing the tragedy.\nLike Mr Hall, he describes a town that supports each other.\n\"So many people came down on to the promenade on Friday evening,\" he says.\n\"They weren't there taking pictures for social media; they were there to show support.\n\"My neighbours brought coffees and teas for the rescuers. People just wanted to help in any way they could. It was remarkable for all the wrong reasons.\"\nJason Catlin, 45, who lives opposite the town's RNLI station, agrees with those sentiments.\n\"Even though something like this does not directly affect everyone, everyone feels it,\" he says.\n\"It feels really sombre.\"\nFriends David Lewis, 69, and Neil Finn, 63, know this stretch of coastline well, and they tell of the dangers.\nGesturing to the road that runs parallel to the promenade, a good distance from the sea, Mr Lewis says: \"I used to be a road sweep for the council and I'd often find pebbles and wood, thrown up by the sea, scattered all along here after a storm.\"\nMr Finn adds: \"I've seen the sea come up over the towers before.\n\"The sea can be very dangerous.\"\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.\nDownload the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devices", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2g8x74vzyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-04T18:39:47+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Their bodies are being returned to their families, some of whom had been holding on to the hope their children might yet be found - injured, but alive.\nThey're now receiving the worst possible news.\nEver since the fire, Laetitia Brodard had been posting pictures of her teenage son Arthur online and appealing for help to find him. On Sunday, she was at the memorial service, being comforted by friends.\n\"He died that first day,\" Laetitia confirmed to me.\nIn an emotional statement on Facebook, she said that Arthur had \"gone to party in paradise\".\nThe victims' bodies were so badly burned by the fire they were difficult to identify. Even some of those injured and in hospitals haven't been named yet - they remain unconscious and unrecognisable.\nFor the dead, forensics experts had to use DNA samples and dental records, and for the families the wait was agonising.\nThe bar was packed full of young people that night, many of them just teenagers. The drinking age in Switzerland is 16.\nSome of the survivors joined a silent procession after the Sunday Mass from the church towards the bar itself. Above, in the stunningly beautiful Swiss Alps, cable cars went on sliding up the mountain carrying tourists to ski.\nThe site of the fire is still screened off behind white plastic sheets, but in front of it are heaps of flowers and soft toys at a shrine that keeps growing.\nAmong the bouquets, there are handwritten notes with names and photographs.\nAt one point, the crowd burst into applause: a large group of firefighters and rescue workers in uniform had reached the memorial and stood arm in arm, sobbing for those they couldn't save.\nFor the people of Crans, they are heroes.\nThe local fire commander - who considered leaving his job after what he experienced here - told us he and his colleagues were now a giant family.\n\"I need them, and they need me,\" David Vocat said, very tearful. \"All my thoughts are for the victims and their families. I am so sorry.\"\nWe've spoken to teenagers who saw people running from the burning bar and describe horrific scenes they say they can never forget.\nA criminal investigation has now been opened. The bar owners, a French couple, are suspected of killing and causing arson and bodily harm through negligence.\nPolice and prosecutors have been examining images filmed inside Le Constellation that show the moment the fire started, with bar staff carried on others' shoulders, delivering champagne bottles with sparklers attached.\nThe sparks appear to set fire to the ceiling, which was covered with foam for soundproofing, and the flames spread very quickly.\nInvestigators will examine whether the foam and other materials met safety standards.\nThey will look into possible overcrowding, access to emergency exits from the basement and whether there were fire extinguishers.\nSome videos show teenagers trying, hopelessly, to put the fire out with their T-shirts. Initially, many didn't realise the immense danger and went on dancing and even filming the fire, instead of fleeing.\nOn Sunday, a group of men - some with their faces covered in black scarves - formed a semi-circle to remember a bouncer at the club, who they called Stefi.\n\"We're here for our colleague,\" one of them said, struggling to speak. \"Stefi has taken his final path. May he now rest in peace.\"\n\"It was important to be here, with the families. We can't change things, we can only be here,\" Diana said, after praying hand-in-hand with two other women for a group of friends who are still in hospital.\n\"We only hope they make it.\"\n\"We are not angry,\" Diana told me. \"But we believe the police will do their work well and we hope there is justice.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn82l012dw6o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-04T21:54:42+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

I was shocked and disappointed. I'm worried it could lead her to start smoking cigarettes or trying other drugs,\" Jane added. \"How do I stop her from doing it?\n\"Someone is selling these vapes to kids - and that is what needs to be stopped.\"\nNot only is it illegal to sell vapes to anyone under the age of 18, it is also against the law to buy them for anyone who is underage.\nDespite the rules, children across the country are still getting their hands on them.\nStatistics from the charity Action on Smoking and Health's Smokefree GB Youth Survey on vaping indicates that in 2025, 20% of 11 to 17-year-olds in Great Britain had tried vaping, a rise from 18% across the same period in 2024.\nIn response to the growing concern about e-cigarette use among school-aged children, Nottingham City Council is launching a two-year anti-vaping scheme, which will be rolled out early in the year.\nThere are concerns that vaping provides a gateway into nicotine addiction - with disposable vapes enticing children and young people with their fruity flavours and cheap prices.\nJane, from Nottingham, found her daughter with a single-use disposable vape, which were banned in June.\nShe said: \"My daughter was telling me that because they taste like peach and candyfloss, they can't be bad for her.\n\"She told me it was like a sweet, and we had to sit down and speak about all the health risks. This is something they need to be doing in schools.\n\"I'm now taking away her pocket money and controlling who she socialises with to try and stop the problem. I don't want to do this, but I'm left with no choice.\n\"They're marketed towards kids, and those kids aren't being educated about the dangers.\"\nLuke Thomas works at NG Vape in the West End Arcade in Nottingham city centre, which has been operating since 2013.\nHe said: \"Children as young as 10 years old come into our store and try to buy vapes.\n\"We turn them away and always ask for ID, but we know that other places don't always do that.\"\nMr Thomas wants the government to introduce licences for shops that sell vapes to ensure the industry is more regulated.\nHe said: \"One of the main reasons why shops are able to sell vapes to kids is because you don't need a licence to sell vapes - so anybody can set up shop and do it.\"\nUK legislation does not currently require stores to have a licence to sell vapes, but the government is trying to change this through the Tobacco and Vapes Bill.\nUnder the proposed legislation, \"only responsible businesses\" with a licence would be allowed to sell vapes and those caught breaking the rules could face unlimited fines or on-the-spot penalties of £2,500.\nMr Thomas said: \"Shops needing licences might help the problem, but it also shouldn't be too difficult to get a licence as it could impact smaller stores.\n\"Regular customers shouldn't be hit with higher prices if vapes become harder to get.

The youngest were a Swiss girl and a French boy, both 14. The group includes people of Swiss, Italian, Romanian, Turkish, Portuguese, French, and Belgian nationalities, as well as a citizen of the UK, France and Israel.\nIn addition to the 40 killed, 119 others were injured. Most have severe burns - six of them so severe that they have yet to be identified.\nA criminal investigation into the French couple who managed Le Constellation bar is under way.\nSparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling are the likely cause of the fire, a preliminary investigation has found.\nPolice said no further details will be released about the victims they had identified out of respect for their relatives.\nHowever, Arthur Brodard's mother took to Facebook on Saturday night to announce her 16-year-old son, Arthur, was one of the dead.\n\"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light,\" she said as she appeared visibly upset in a video message. He \"has left to party in paradise\", she said.\nWhile Arthur was still presumed missing and information on his whereabouts was scarce, Ms Brodard-Sitre told local newspaper Le Temps that she had been \"living a nightmare\".\nSome of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"\nLe Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.\nThe French couple who own the bar - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office for the Valais region said.\nBeatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".\nA teenager who went to two schools in the UK has been confirmed as one of the victims killed in the fire.\nCharlotte Niddam, who was believed to be 15, previously attended Immanuel College in Hertfordshire and the Jewish Free School in north-west London, according to reports.\nIn a post on social media, the teenager's family announced her death \"with great sadness\" and said details of her funeral arrangements would be made in due course.

Like Japan, South Korea too is an ally of the US, which supports Taiwan and supplies arms for its defence.\nXi is expected to hold a welcoming ceremony for Lee in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, state-run CCTV reports.\nLee, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday, will then meet China's Premier Li Qiang and the chairman of parliament, Zhao Leji, before flying to Shanghai.\nSpeaking before Korean residents in Beijing on Sunday, Lee said his visit would \"serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level\".\nThis is the first visit by a South Korean leader since 2019. The relationship soured under Lee's predecessor, impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was very critical of China.\nOn the other side, Xi's eagerness to meet Lee signals the pressure he faces in finding a regional ally, Park Seung-chan, professor of China studies at Yongin University told the BBC.\n\"China may beat around the bush but its demand is clear: side with China and denounce Japan.\"\nBeijing has been leveraging the two countries' shared history of fighting against Japan during the 20th Century, Mr Park said. Lee is expected to hold a memorial service in Shanghai for activists who fought for Korea's independence from Japan.\nWhile Korea is \"still showing all its deference towards China\", it wants to \"strengthen its relationships with both Japan and China\", Mr Park added.\nSeoul has long walked a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Tokyo. Lee is reportedly planning to visit Japan later this month to meet Takaichi. And on Friday, South Korea's national security director Wi Sung-lac told reporters the country \"respects the One China policy\" - the diplomatic acknowledgment that Beijing is the only Chinese government.\nSecurity on the Korean Peninsula will also be part of the discussions with China, Wi told reporters.\nLee has sought to engage North Korea diplomatically, but there has been little progress so far. He needs Chinese cooperation in pressuring the North's Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons. Beijing is the dictator's biggest supporter, economically and diplomatically, Russia aside.\n\"China is a very important cooperative partner in moving toward peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula,\" Lee said on Sunday.\nEarlier in the day Seoul's military said Pyongyang fired ballistic missiles off its east coast. And on Monday the North's state news agency said the country test-fired hypersonic missiles to assess deterrence capabilities following recent developments, a reference to the US's capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro over the weekend.\nIt remains unclear how much Lee will be able to push China on North Korea. In September, Xi had pledged to strengthen Beijing's \"traditional friendship\" with Pyongyang.\nAnd Seoul and Beijing are not natural allies.\nUS troops have been stationed in South Korea for decades in case of an attack from the North, and last year the two sides agreed to cooperate on building nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement drew warnings from China.\nThere are other sore spots, such as China's unofficial restrictions on South Korean music and dramas that have been in place for a decade. K-pop and K-dramas are either unavailable or difficult to access on Chinese media platforms.\nWhile China has never acknowledged a ban on Korean artists, it's believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region.\nPersuading Beijing to lift these restrictions is said to be high on Lee's agenda. China is a massive market for Korean entertainment, which is already a huge global success.\nLee will also be seeking to put a stop to China's build-up of maritime structures in waters between the two countries. Beijing says the structures are fish-farming equipment, but they have sparked security concerns in Seoul.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70lw9x581no?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-05T08:51:15+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Australia are 166-2 after 34.1 overs and have cut the deficit to 218.\nThe tourists had earlier lost 7-158, including a final collapse of 5-61 sparked by Jamie Smith's horrific dismissal.\nSmith, who was caught off a no-ball and had other moments of fortune in his skittish 46, played a truly awful shot to be caught off part-time medium-pacer Marnus Labuschagne.\nOn a pitch that offered more for the bowlers on Monday, England's total felt around par, and Australia's batters made rapid inroads, helped by the tourists' attack and two dropped catches.\nWith new-ball bowlers Brydon Carse and Matthew Potts leaking runs, Jake Weatherald was put down twice as he and Head added 50 in 9.2 overs.\nIt took the belated introduction of captain Ben Stokes to trap Weatherald lbw, with Head then sharing another 105 with Labuschagne. Stokes and Labuschagne exchanged words before the England captain drew him into an edge to gully for 48.\nHead remains, on course for his third century of the series. Of equal concern for England would have been the fitness of Root, but a spell off the field at the end of the day was later explained as cramp in his back.\n'Brainless' Smith wicket 'sums up' England's Ashes\n- Published4 hours ago\nMixed day towards end of strange Ashes\nHyped and anticipated, this has turned into a poor Ashes series, low on quality, individual brilliance and magic moments.\nThe second day of this finale was in keeping with what came before. Root and Head elevated themselves above the rest and Michael Neser took 4-60 in an improved Australia bowling performance, but England were slapdash with the ball and Smith's dismissal was atrocious.\nEven the obvious Australian plan was bizarre. Labuschagne, who had not before taken a Test wicket with his seam, had seven fielders on the boundary for some gentle bouncers.\nStill, Smith continued his poor tour with a forehand to Scott Boland at deepish cover. It was a dismissal that encapsulated the carelessness that so often costs this England team.\nOnly three times has a team made more than England's 384 batting first in a Test on this ground and lost, and the pitch is already showing signs of uneven bounce.\nBut Australia have the prolific Head, the opportunity to go beyond England's score on Tuesday and the potential of pressuring the fragile visitors in the third innings.\nHead threatens England again\nHead's elevation to open in the second innings of the first Test in Perth was the defining moment of the series and the left-hander is tucking into England's bowling once more.\nSomehow, England continue to feed his strength outside off stump. Arguably neither Carse nor Potts - the latter playing his first Test for more than a year - should have been opening the bowling, and they let Australia get off to a flyer.\nIn fairness, each bowler had Weatherald dropped. Root parried a tough high edge at first slip off Potts when Weatherald had nine, then Ben Duckett shelled a more straightforward chance at mid-wicket off Carse when he had 14.\nStokes, on in the 11th over, ensured neither miss was too costly. With his eighth delivery, the captain had Weatherald play all around a full one.\nFollowing his intervention with the ball, Labuschagne eased into Head's slipstream. Head carved through the off side, Labuschagne played clips and drives. The clouds gathered, Potts' economy was more than eight an over.\nAs the umpires discussed the light, Stokes and Labuschagne went at each other. Play continued, Stokes got his man, and Head slowed up to leave an overnight wait for his hundred.\nRoot stands tall\nRoot has been feast or famine in this series. Until this Test, his landmark century in Brisbane was one of only two occasions when he passed 20. In Sydney, the city where he was dropped for the only time in his Test career and once batted himself into hospital in extreme heat, the former captain was outstanding.\nWithout Root, England would have squandered their promising overnight position of 211-3. Harry Brook played a limp poke at Scott Boland to be caught at slip for 84 and Stokes edged a beauty from Mitchell Starc for an 11-ball duck, meaning the tourists lost 2-3 in four overs.\nOn one hand, Smith's role in a stand of 94 with Root was valuable, but the wicketkeeper was fortunate to last so long. He was caught off a Cameron Green no-ball on 22, then edged and miscued the same bowler. The dismissal to Labuschagne's bouncer plan as the second new ball approached was an appalling piece of cricket.\nBy this point, Root had moved to three figures from his overnight 72. After edging Neser over the slips on 94, he drove the same bowler down the ground to join Australia great Ricky Ponting on 41 Test tons - only India's Sachin Tendulkar and South Africa's Jacques Kallis have more. He celebrated with the same shrug of the shoulders he pulled in Brisbane.\nOn he went, adding 52 for the seventh wicket with Will Jacks. He passed 150 for the 17th time in Tests - only four other players have done so more.\nRoot eventually offered a leading edge to a diving Neser in the bowler's follow-through, part of England's final collapse of 4-9. After carrying England's batting, perhaps it is no surprise he later suffered discomfort in his back.\nRelated topics\n- Published16 August 2025", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cg5g2dvvn91o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-05T07:12:51+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.\n\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job. Not to be a coach.\"\nAmorim also floated the idea that United have become too sensitive to outside criticism.\nHe said: \"If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticisms of everything, we need to change the club.\"\nNeville is one of a number of high-profile former United players who have been massively critical of the club recently.\nThe former captain described the home draw with bottom-of-the-table Wolves on 30 December as \"the baddest of the bad\".\nSpeaking on The Gary Neville Podcast following Amorim's comments on Sunday, Neville said: \"Something has happened in the last week which means that Amorim is starting to unleash a little bit.\n\"It looks to me that he is not happy with something in the hierarchy.\n\"Obviously something is annoying him - he's obviously not feeling the support. He's obviously letting go.\n\"When you say that you came to the club as a manager, I thought he was appointed as the head coach and quite clearly appointed to coach the team.\"\nLast month, Neville's fellow 'Class of 92' member Paul Scholes said Amorim \"doesn't get\" Manchester United because of his preference to play a three-man defensive formation with wing-backs, which goes against the club's tradition of playing with wingers.\nAmorim changed the system to four at the back for the victory over Newcastle on Boxing Day but reverted to a back three for subsequent games, including at Leeds.\nA recent report claimed Christopher Vivell, United's head of recruitment, called on Amorim to adapt his system after a particularly detailed explanation by Fulham boss Marco Silva of his plan to counter it following the 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage in August.\nAmorim has said there have been disagreements with the club over transfer targets, while hints at growing tensions with director of football Jason Wilcox have been getting stronger.\nAmorim's 18-month plan - unless board 'decides to change'\nWhen asked if he still feels he has the confidence of the United hierarchy, Amorim said: \"To start with that, I noticed that you received selective information about everything.\n\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear.\n\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. And it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change.\n\"I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"\nWhile United officials have tried to create a picture of harmony, their words are being tested by Amorim, who was named as 'head coach' when the club announced his arrival as the successor of Erik ten Hag – who was the manager – on 1 November 2024.\nAmorim still believes United are moving in the right direction despite a run of one win in five games and three in 11.\nIt remains to be seen if his comments have any immediate impact. Amorim is next due to speak to the media on Tuesday, before his side's trip to Burnley the following evening.\n'Now the situation has become serious' - analysis\nAmorim was given the chance to fully explain his post-match comments at Elland Road. Instead, he elected to leave the media room and let the journalists try to work it out for themselves.\nHe adopted a similar approach on Friday when he cryptically suggested there had been disagreements over recruitment, potentially in the wake of an attempt to sign Antoine Semenyo ending in failure.\nAs it stands, we don't know if Amorim wanted the £65m that United were willing to spend on Semenyo relocated to another part of his team, which badly needs reinforcements.\nWhat we do know about is his belief that managers need influence over recruitment. That is because he explained it when he spoke to the media after the 1-0 win over Newcastle on 26 December, as he looked ahead to the Wolves game.\nHe said then: \"Sometimes I have one idea, Jason [Wilcox] and the board has another idea, [but] every decision we make we need to reach a common ground.\n\"That is really important. You don't need to make everything for the manager because the manager can change and [then] you need to change everything. But you also need to understand [that] the manager understands the way of playing.\"\nIt hinted at a divergence of opinion and Amorim has done nothing to quell that idea. Now, the situation is becoming serious.\nOn Tuesday, Amorim is bound to be asked for the clarification he refused to give at Elland Road.\nAt what point does Wilcox – who has not spoken publicly to the media other than one 'safe' club interview – get involved? Or chief executive Omar Berrada? Or minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe? Or the Glazers?\nAmorim spoke a lot at Leeds about the next 18 months, in the sense that if he is left alone until the end of his contract, everyone can move on. But the modern football world is not like that.\nUnited's position in the table remains more or less as it was before the Leeds game. In pure league position terms, they are on track to qualify for Europe, which is the target Amorim was given this summer.\nBut it is impossible to imagine the current tension being allowed to simmer for another 18 months.\nAmorim clearly thinks the parameters of the job he was sold have changed. Berrada flew to Portugal in the wake of Ten Hag's dismissal and persuaded him to leave Sporting immediately - rather than wait until the summer as he pleaded to do.\nIt appears that where we have ended up is not to Amorim's liking.\nThe big questions, therefore, are these.\nIf Amorim cannot accept where United are now, are the club willing to alter their vision?\nIf not, regardless of their position in the table, what will they do about it?\nUnited boss backs misfiring Sesko\nAmorim is not being helped by the form of £73.7m striker Benjamin Sesko.\nThe Slovenian has scored only two goals in 16 appearances and wasted more opportunities against Leeds, including the visitors' best opportunity to get a winner when he sent Joshua Zirkzee's low cross wide from six yards despite being in front of the goal.\nIt is now nine games since he found the net, against Sunderland on 4 October, and the decision to bring Sesko in as a replacement for Rasmus Hojlund, who has moved to Napoli on loan after two underwhelming seasons as United's number nine and has scored nine goals in 21 games, is now open to question.\nNot that Amorim sees the situation in quite such clear terms.\n\"Ben has completely different characteristics to Rasmus and he is doing the right things,\" Amorim said.\n\"I know as a striker, if you miss chances they [outside critics] will say the player did everything wrong, but to miss the chances he's missing, he has to be there.

Can't get any worse\".\nOn Saturday, Trump had vowed the US would \"run\" the country until \"a safe and proper and judicious transition\" was possible.\nTrump also promised US oil companies would move into the country to fix infrastructure \"and start making money for the country\".\nDespite the US president's claims, Maduro's allies remain in charge.\nThe Cuban government has said 32 \"brave Cuban combatants\" died when US forces attacked and captured Maduro and his wife. Cuba - a longstanding socialist ally of Maduro - has announced two days of national mourning.\nIn several TV interviews on Sunday morning, Rubio defended the US's military operation in Venezuela, stressing the action did not mean the US is at war with the South American country.\n\"We are at war against drug trafficking organisations. That's not a war against Venezuela,\" Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday morning.\nThe secretary of state also told CBS that if Venezuela doesn't \"make the right decisions\", the US \"will retain multiple levers of leverage to ensure that our interests are protected\".\nThat includes the \"quarantine\" the US has placed on Venezuela's oil, he said.\n\"We're going to judge everything by what they do, and we're going to see what they do,\" he added.\nTrump also threatened Venezuela's neighbour Colombia, in comments to reporters aboard Air Force One.\nHe did not rule out military action against Colombia, saying \"it sounds good to me\", and called Colombian President Gustavo Petro \"a sick man\".\n\"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long,\" Trump said.\nMaduro, who leads the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and has been in power since 2013, has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence.\nHe is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election.\nVenezuela's left-wing leader and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured at their compound and flown to the US, as part of a dramatic special forces operation in the early hours of Saturday that also saw strikes on military bases.\nThe couple have since been charged with weapon and drug offences and are set to appear at a court in New York on Monday.\nMaduro has denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's oil.\nWhile US officials have said that no American troops were harmed in the attacks, Venezuela's Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said a \"large part\" of Maduro's security team and \"soldiers and innocent civilians\" were killed in the US operation.\nWhen asked why congressional authorisation wasn't sought before the US operation in Venezuela, Rubio told ABC it \"wasn't necessary because this wasn't an invasion\".\nHe described it as a \"law enforcement operation\", and said Maduro was arrested on the ground by FBI agents.\nYou can't notify Congress of an operation like this because \"it will leak\", he added.\nSpeaking to US media outlets, Rubio was asked if the US recognises Rodríguez as the legitimate president of Venezuela.\nHe answered that \"this is not about the legitimate president\" as the US does not recognise the regime as legitimate.\nSome Democratic lawmakers have condemned the administration's actions.\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said the secretive military operation, which was conducted without approval from Congress, \"was not simply a narcotics operation\".\n\"It was an act of war,\" Jeffries told NBC's Meet the Press.\n\"This was a military action involving Delta Force, involving the army, apparently involving thousands of troops, involving at least 150 military aircraft, perhaps involving dozens of ships off the coast of Venezuela and South America.\"\nJim Himes, the most senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told CBS Face the Nation he had had \"zero outreach\" from the Trump administration, adding \"no Democrat that I'm aware of has had any outreach\".\nIn an interview with ABC This Week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer questioned the legality of the US operation.\nSchumer said that while he believes Maduro is a horrible person, \"You don't treat lawlessness with other lawlessness\".\n\"We have learned through the years when America tries to do regime change and nation building in this way, the American people pay the price in both blood and in dollars,\" Schumer said.\nBoth Schumer and Jeffries vowed to support a resolution that, if passed in both houses, would prohibit Trump from taking any further action in Venezuela without Congressional approval.\nIn a joint statement, the governments of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay and Spain said the US's military actions \"constitute an extremely dangerous precedent for peace and regional security and endanger the civilian population\".\nAdditional reporting by Laurence Peter", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgnxvp477eo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-05T05:23:06+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

But in that role she publicly took a backseat - presenting a more family-oriented face to what critics say was a brutal regime.\nShe hosted a TV show, Con Cilia en Familia, and made occasional appearances on state television to dance salsa with her husband. But behind-the-scenes, she is thought to have been one of Maduro's key advisers, and an architect of his political survival.\nFlores has faced allegations of corruption and nepotism, and in recent years her family members have been found guilty in US courts of cocaine smuggling.\nShe will now face drug trafficking and weapons charges in a New York court, along with her husband.\nFlores met Maduro in the early 1990s, when - as a young up-and-coming lawyer - she took on the defence of the plotters of the failed 1992 coup attempt.\nChief among them: Hugo Chávez, the man who would later become president.\nIt was during those years that she met Maduro, who at the time was working for Chávez as a security guard.\n\"I met Cilia in life,\" Maduro recounted. \"She was the lawyer for several imprisoned patriotic military officers. But she was also Commander Chávez's lawyer and, well, being Commander Chávez's lawyer in prison... tough.\"\n\"I met her during those years of struggle, and then, well, she caught my eye.\"\nFrom then, both their fates became linked to Chávez and his political movement, known as Chavismo.\nAfter Chávez won the presidency in 1998, Flores quickly rose through the political ranks, joining the National Assembly in 2000 and becoming its leader in 2006.\nFor six years she led a virtually one-party parliament, with the main opposition parties refusing to participate in elections, saying they were not free and fair.\nWhen Chávez died in 2013, Flores threw her weight behind Maduro, who narrowly won the subsequent presidential election.\nMonths later the pair married, formalising a years-long relationship in which they'd lived together, raising children from previous relationships: three of hers and one of his.\n\"She became a critical piece in Maduro's regime,\" said José Enrique Arrioja, a Venezuelan journalist and managing editor of Americas Quarterly.\n\"She was not only the emotional confidant of Maduro, but the professional confidant too. And she was very power-driven.\"\nAcross her career, she has faced numerous allegations of corruption.\nIn 2012, she was accused by unions of nepotism for influencing the hiring of up to 40 people, including numerous members of her family.\n\"My family came here and I am very proud that they are my family. I will defend them,\" she responded.\nIn November 2015, she became embroiled in the \"Narco nephews\" case, when two of her nephews - Francisco Flores de Freitas and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores - were arrested in Haiti in a sting operation by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\nThey were caught trying to smuggle 800kg of cocaine into the US.\nFlores accused US authorities of having \"kidnapped\" her nephews - but a judge sentenced the two men to 18 years in prison for drug trafficking. They were returned to Venezuela in 2022 as part of a prisoner swap under the Biden administration.\nBut last month, the Trump administration announced fresh sanctions on the two nephews - as well as a third nephew, Carlos Erik Malpica Flores - with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying: \"Nicolás Maduro and his criminal associates in Venezuela are flooding the United States with drugs that are poisoning the American people.\"\n\"Treasury is holding the regime and its circle of cronies and companies accountable for its continued crimes,\" he added.\nThe newly unsealed indictment against Flores accuses her - among other things - of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in 2007 to arrange a meeting between \"a large-scale drug trafficker\" and the director of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office.\n\"To her detractors, she is seen as part of a deeply corrupt, human-rights-abusing and brutal government,\" says Christopher Sabatini, Senior Fellow and Chatham House's Latin America programme.\n\"She was a power behind the throne,\" he adds. \"But like any good power behind the throne, you really didn't see her hand that much, so no one really knew how powerful she was.\"\nShe is expected in court on Monday.\nAdditional reporting by BBC Mundo", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgl7k91nl8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-04T19:01:02+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

It was the result of months of meticulous planning and rehearsals, which even included elite US troops creating an exact full-size replica of Maduro's Caracas safe house to practise their entry routes.\nThe plan - which amounted to an extraordinary US military intervention in Latin America not seen since the Cold War - was closely guarded. Congress was not informed or consulted ahead of time. With the precise details set, top military officials simply had to wait for the optimal conditions to launch.\nThey wanted to maximise the element of surprise, officials said on Saturday. There was a false start four days earlier when US President Donald Trump gave approval, but they opted to wait for better weather and less cloud cover.\n\"Over the weeks through Christmas and New Year, the men and women of the United States military sat ready, patiently waiting for the right triggers to be met and the president to order us into action,\" General Dan Caine, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, told a news conference on Saturday morning.\n'Good luck and godspeed'\nThe order from the president to begin the mission finally came at 22:46 EST on Friday (03:46 GMT on Saturday).\n\"We were going to do this four days ago, three days ago, two days ago, and then all of a sudden it opened up. And we said: go,\" Trump himself told Fox & Friends on Saturday, hours after the overnight raid.\n\"He said to us, and we appreciate it... good luck and godspeed,\" Gen Caine said. Trump's order came shortly before midnight in Caracas, giving the military most of the night to operate in darkness.\nWhat followed was a two-hour-and-twenty-minute mission by air, land and sea that stunned many in Washington and around the world.\nIn terms of scale and precision, it was virtually unprecedented. And it drew immediate condemnation from several regional powers, with Brazil's President Lula da Silva saying the violent capture of Venezuela's leader set \"yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community\".\nTrump did not follow the mission from the White House situation room. Instead, he was surrounded by his advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he watched a live stream of the operation flanked by CIA Director John Ratcliffe and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\"It was an incredible thing to see,\" Trump said on Saturday. \"If you would have seen what happened, I mean, I watched it literally like I was watching a television show. And if you would've seen the speed, the violence... it's just, it was an amazing thing, an amazing job that these people did.\"\nIn recent months, thousands of US troops have deployed to the region, joining an aircraft carrier and dozens of warships in the largest military build-up in decades as Trump has accused Maduro of drug-trafficking and narco-terrorism, and blown up dozens of small boats accused of ferrying drugs through the region.\nBut the first signs of Operation Absolute Resolve were in the skies. More than 150 aircraft - including bombers, fighter jets and reconnaissance planes - were ultimately deployed through the course of the night, according to US officials.\n\"It was very complex, extremely complex, the whole manoeuvre, the landings, the number of aircraft,\" Trump told Fox News. \"We had a fighter jet for every possible situation.\"\nLoud explosions were heard in Caracas at about 02:00 local time (06:00 GMT), and plumes of smoke were seen rising over the city. \"I heard a huge sound, a loud bang,\" reporter Ana Vanessa Herrero told the BBC. \"It moved all the windows. Immediately after I saw a huge cloud of smoke that almost blocked the entire view.\"\nShe added: \"Planes and helicopters were flying all over the city.\"\nSoon, videos showing numerous aircraft in the skies - and others showing the apparent aftermath of explosions - began to circulate widely on social media. One showed a convoy of helicopters flying at low altitude over Caracas as smoke rose from apparent detonations.\n\"We woke up at around 01:55 to the roar of explosions and the hum of planes flying over Caracas,\" one witness, Daniela, told the BBC. \"Everything was plunged into absolute darkness, illuminated only by the flashes of nearby detonations.\"\nShe added: \"Neighbours were messaging in the condominium group chat, all confused and unaware of what was happening [and] frightened by the blasts.\"\nBBC Verify has examined a number of videos showing explosions, fire and smoke in locations around Caracas to identify exactly which sites were targeted.\nSo far, it has confirmed five locations including Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base, an airfield known as La Carlota and Port La Guaira, Caracas' main conduit to the Caribbean Sea.\nSome of the US strikes targeted air defence systems and other military targets, officials said. Trump also suggested the US cut the power in Caracas before the mission began, though he did not specify how.\n\"The lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have,\" he said. \"It was dark and it was deadly.\"\n'They knew we were coming'\nAs strikes rang out around Caracas, US forces made their way into the city. They included members of the elite Delta Force, the US military's top special mission unit, sources told the BBC's US news partner CBS. They were heavily armed - and carried a blowtorch in case they had to cut through the metal doors of Maduro's safe house.\nThe troops arrived at Maduro's location shortly after the strikes began at 02:01 local time, according to Gen Caine. Trump described the safe house as a military \"fortress\" in the heart of Caracas, saying: \"They were in a ready position waiting for us. They knew we were coming.\"\nThe troops took fire when they arrived, and one of the US helicopters was hit but was still able to fly. \"The apprehension force descended into Maduro's compound and moved with speed, precision and discipline,\" Gen Caine said.\n\"They just broke in, and they broke into places that were not really able to be broken into, you know, steel doors that were put there for just this reason,\" Trump remarked.\nIt was only as the operation - which also saw Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, seized - was unfolding that Rubio began notifying lawmakers about the action, a decision which has since prompted anger from some in the US Congress.\n\"Let me be clear: Nicolas Maduro is an illegitimate dictator. But launching military action without congressional authorisation and without a credible plan for what comes next is reckless,\" said top Democrat Chuck Schumer, the party's leader in the Senate.\nBriefing Congress ahead of time would have endangered the mission, Rubio told reporters during the news conference on Saturday. \"Congress has a tendency to leak,\" Trump added. \"This would not be good.\"\nIn Maduro's compound, as elite US troops flooded in, Trump said the Venezuelan president - who has reportedly increased his reliance on Cuban bodyguards in recent months - attempted to flee to a safe room.\n\"He was trying to get to a safe place, which wasn't safe, because we would have had the door blown up in about 47 seconds,\" Trump said.\n\"He made it to the door. He was unable to close it. He got bum rushed so fast that he didn't get into that [room].\"\nWhen asked if the US could have killed Maduro, an authoritarian leader who took over the presidency in 2013, if he had resisted arrest, Trump said: \"It could have happened.\"\nOn the US side, \"a couple of guys were hit\", he said, but no US service members were killed.\nIn a statement on Sunday, Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said a \"large part\" of Maduro's security team and \"soldiers and innocent civilians\" were killed in the US operation.\nThe US had previously offered a $50m (£37m) reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest. But by 04:20 local time on Saturday, helicopters were leaving Venezuelan territory with Maduro and his wife on board, in custody of the US Department of Justice and en route ultimately to New York, where they are expected to face criminal charges.\nAlmost exactly an hour later Trump announced the news of his capture to the world. \"Maduro and his wife will soon face the full might of American justice,\" he said.\nAdditional reporting by Cristobal Vasquez", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdred61epg4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-04T21:32:43+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Instead of recreating the crime, the movie tells the story of what comes after: the everyday life of high-schooler Joo-in, from school to romance to family and friendships, and all the moments of conflict and joy that go along with it.\nIt has earned the praise of critics and audiences, and more than $1.1m in box office revenue since its debut in October. Viewers have given it a 9 out of 10 on South Korea's largest search portal, Naver.\n\"Simply a masterpiece,\" is how Bong Jun-ho, director of the globally acclaimed film Parasite and the first Korean to win an Oscar, described it. He called himself the \"head of the Seoul branch of Yoon Ga-eun's fan club\".\nThe film has resonated in a deeply patriarchal country, where women say they fight hard just to be heard. And its surprising success is a sign of the growing willingness to engage in conversations about sexual violence and how survivors are treated.\n'That's not all I am'\nThe World of Love may not seem like an obvious choice for movie-goers.\nThe Korean title, \"Joo-in of the World\", says little about the plot. While it stars Parasite actor Jang Hye-jin and K-drama star Go Min-si, the lead is played by Seo Su-bin, a new face on the big screen.\nAt its heart, this is a story about the the life of 17-year-old Joo-in.\nEverything is going well for her. She is popular at school, has a devoted boyfriend, and lives with a caring mum and adorable younger brother.\nTension begins over her refusal to sign a petition at school. A man who assaulted a 10-year-old child is about to be released from jail into her neighbourhood. So a fellow student starts a petition calling for the suspension of his release. Joo-in is the only one who refuses to sign.\nShe objects to a single line in the petition: \"Sexual violence leaves deep wounds that never heal and completely destroys a person's life and soul.\"\n\"I can't agree with this statement,\" Joo-in tells the student who drafted it.\nThe standoff ends up revealing her secret: she was raped by a relative when she was younger.\nDespite the harrowing theme, Ms Yoon is determined to explore the fullness of Joo-in's life, whose name means \"owner\" or \"master\" in Korean, alluding to the autonomy Ms Yoon envisioned for her character.\nJournalists who attended the media screening received a hand-written letter from Ms Yoon asking them to avoid mentioning sexual violence while covering the film.\n\"The story is more about how we look at her,\" Ms Yoon explained to the BBC, adding that she didn't want to pin a label - childhood sexual abuse survivor - on her protagonist.\n\"Because Joo-in herself refuses that. It's one part of her identity and it shakes her, but she insists, 'That's not all I am'.\"\nWhen she decided to make a film about sexual violence, Ms Yoon was clear about one thing. She did not want it to be predictable.\nDuring her research, she said she \"watched pretty much everything that was out there\" on this subject. She spoke with survivors and consulted activists. Those conversations shattered the \"prejudice\" she carried, an ignorance that \"reduces a person entirely to their wound\".\n\"We spent so much time talking about completely ordinary concerns,\" she said. \"Worries about work, family, friendships and romances, about needing to lose weight or gain weight or exercise more. I think those moments dissolved even that last tiny bit of prejudice I still had.\"\nThis touched audiences.\nThose who liked the film say it challenges the stereotypes we project onto survivors of sexual crimes, encouraging audiences to see them differently - people who are part of society and trying to live their lives like everyone else.\nWhen Seo Jinwon, a children's book editor watched the film in Seoul, she said, the cinema \"fell completely silent\" as the film ended.\n\"No-one rushed to leave. I stayed and watched the end credits. I walked out of the cinema thinking, 'I want to be a good adult who can stand beside all the children and teenagers who are trying so hard to grow up'.\"\nA sexual violence survivor who wished to remain anonoymous said she had an urge to \"stretch my arms and cheer\" when she walked out of the cinema.\n\"Joo-in gave me so much. At the end, it felt like she was smiling at me and saying, 'I am living well, so let's keep living well together'.\"\nThe right moment\nThe World of Love is doing what activists have long worked towards, according to Cho Eunhee, director of Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center who worked as a consultant on the film.\nThe timing, she added, \"is incredibly right\".\nAfter the 2017–2018 MeToo movement, it became easier for survivors to share their stories, and the country grew more protective and understanding towards them. By 2025, when Ms Yoon's film was released, \"people were more prepared to empathise with a story like this,\" Ms Cho said.\nShe wonders if, even a few years earlier, the film would have \"found this level of public understanding\".\nWhile the MeToo movement sparked conversations about harassment and assaults in workplaces and outside the home, exposing abuse within families, she said, is still widely seen as \"spitting in one's own face\" - but this movie has made more room to talk about it.\nThe World of Love is not without its critics. Some viewers, including survivors, said it felt unrepresentative of their reality because it downplayed the fear and lasting damage of abuse, portraying families as more supportive than they often were.\nBut criticism does not overshadow the film's value, critic Min Youngjun said, adding that The World of Love has created a healthy space for talking about sexual violence and its victims.\n\"The mark of a good film is not how many people liked it versus didn't like it. What matters is whether it creates a space in which we can talk to each other about what it has put on the table.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrz3dey7lxo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-04T23:15:58+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Will his plan work?", "body": "Donald Trump has said that American oil firms will invest billions to produce oil in Venezuela.", "content": "Trump wants Venezuela's oil. Will his plan work?\nDonald Trump has vowed to tap into Venezuela's oil reserves after seizing President Nicolás Maduro and saying the US will \"run\" the country until a \"safe\" transition.\nThe US president wants American oil firms to pile billions of dollars into the South American country, which has the largest crude oil reserves on the planet, to mobilise the largely untapped resource.\nHe said US companies will fix Venezuela's \"badly broken\" oil infrastructure and \"start making money for the country\".\nBut experts warned of huge challenges with Trump's plan, saying it would cost billions and take up to a decade to produce a meaningful uplift in oil output.\nSo can the US really take control of Venezuela's oil reserves? And will Trump's plan work?\nWith an estimated 303 billion barrels, Venezuela is home to the world's largest proven oil reserves.\nBut the amount of oil the country actually produces today is tiny by comparison.\nOutput has dropped off sharply since the early 2000s, as former President Hugo Chavez and then the Maduro administration tightened control over the state-run oil company, PDVSA, leading to an exodus of more experienced staff.\nThough some Western oil firms, including the US company Chevron, are still active in the country, their operations have shrunk significantly as the US has widened sanctions and targeted oil exports, aiming to curb Maduro's access to a key economic lifeline.\nSanctions - which the US first put in place in 2015 during President Barack Obama's administration over alleged human rights violations - have also left the country largely cut off from the investment and the parts it needs.\n\"The real challenge they've got is their infrastructure,\" says Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec.\nIn November, Venezuela produced an estimated 860,000 barrels per day, according to the latest oil market report from the International Energy Agency.\nThat is barely a third of what it was 10 years ago and accounts for less than 1% of world oil consumption.\nThe country's oil reserves are made up of so-called \"heavy, sour\" oil. It is harder to refine, but useful for making diesel and asphalt. The US typically produces \"light, sweet\" oil used to make petrol.\nIn the run-up to the strikes and capture of Maduro, the US also seized two oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela, as well as ordering a blockade of sanctioned tankers entering and leaving the country.\nHomayoun Falakshahi, senior commodity analyst at data platform Kpler, says the key hurdles for oil firms hoping to exploit Venezuelan reserves are legal and political.\nSpeaking to the BBC, he said those hoping to drill in Venezuela would need an agreement with the government, which will not be possible until Maduro's successor is in place.\nCompanies would then be left gambling billions of investment on the stability of a future Venezuelan government, Mr Falakshahi added.\n\"Even if the political situation is stable, it's a process that takes months,\" he said. Companies hoping to take advantage of Trump's plan would need to sign contracts with the new government when it is in place, before beginning the process of ramping up investment in infrastructure in Venezuela.\nAnalysts have also warned it would take tens of billions of dollars - and potentially a decade - to restore Venezuela's former output.\nNeil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, said Trump's plans would have a limited impact on the global supply, and therefore price, of oil.\nHe said there are \"an enormous number of hurdles to overcome and the timeframe of what is going to happen is so long\" that oil prices in 2026 would likely see little change.\nMr Shearing said firms would not invest until a stable government is in place in Venezuela, and the projects would not deliver for \"many, many years\".\n\"The issue has always been decades of underinvestment, mismanagement and it is really expensive to extract,\" he said.\nHe added that even if the country could return to previous production levels of around three million barrels per day, it would still be outside the world's top 10 producers.\nAnd Mr Shearing pointed to high production among Opec+ countries, saying the world is currently \"not suffering from a shortage of oil\".\nThe former chief executive of BP, Lord Browne, told the BBC that reviving Venezuela's oil industry was a \"very long term project\".\n\"People underestimate the time it takes to do things. Marshalling all the resources, the material and people in particular, takes a very long time.\"\nWhile there might be a \"quick pick up\" of some production, he added, output might actually fall while the industry is reorganising.\nChevron is the only American oil producer still active in Venezuela, after receiving a licence under former President Joe Biden in 2022 to operate, despite US sanctions.\nThe company, currently responsible for around a fifth of Venezuelan oil extraction, said it is focused on the safety of its employees and is complying \"with all relevant laws and regulations\".\nOther major oil firms have been publicly silent on the plans so far, with only Chevron addressing the situation.\nBut Mr Falakshahi said oil bosses will be in talks internally about whether to take advantage of the opportunity.\nHe added: \"The appetite to go somewhere is linked to two main factors, the political situation and the resources on the ground.\"\nDespite the hugely uncertain political situation, Mr Falakshahi said \"the potential prize may be deemed too big to avoid\".\nLord Browne said companies would want to get involved because \"having options for business in different parts of the world is a good thing to have\".\n\"As a piece of business, if you were running a company... you want to get involved very quickly\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkr4y717k7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_at": "2026-01-05T07:54:12+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Venezuela was one of China's major partners in Latin America and non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations is consistently touted as a fundamental point of Chinese principle.\nIndeed, its foreign ministry was quick to describe the US operation as \"shocking\" and a \"clear violation of international law\".\nFollow the latest on US actions in Venezuela\nIts anger might well have been compounded by the optics; just hours before his capture, Nicolas Maduro was hosting a Chinese delegation in Caracas led by its special representative on Latin American affairs, Qiu Xiaoqi.\nFootage of them smiling together, seemingly oblivious to what was about to unfold, might well be seen as embarrassing to a nation that does not like to lose face.\nFinancially, China will be moving fast to shore up its interests, but its exposure to Venezuela is not as great as some might think.\nYes, it is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil, but it only makes up around 4% of the total volume of China's oil imports, and analysts say it's shielded to a degree by large volumes already en route (pre-purchased in anticipation of sanctions) and stockpiles that already exist.\nIn short, Maduro needed China more than China needed Maduro.\nThe most consequential impacts are likely to be geopolitical.\nIndeed, Chinese social media has been alight with users drawing comparisons with Taiwan. They ask, if the US can unilaterally arrest the leader of a sovereign nation, what's to stop China moving to capture the leader of what they see as a renegade province?\nWhile the precedent set by Trump in the last few days could be a dangerous one in theory, in reality it probably doesn't accelerate a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. For now, China has clearly opted for a campaign of coercion, pressure and reunification without a war.\nRead more:\nTrump may not stop at Venezuela\nHow Maduro was captured\nWho will take over as Venezuela's president?\nBut it does arguably move the dial within that campaign.\nCan the US be persuaded to quieten its critiques when China sails close to the line of international law, for instance?

Venezuelan oil is extra-heavy crude, used for making diesel, jet fuel, asphalt and as a raw material in petro-chemicals.\nVenezuela crisis: Follow the latest developments\nBecause it's highly viscous - thick and sticky - it's more complex to extract, and requires refinement - but perhaps crucially, while the US does not have large reserves of this kind of crude, it does have refineries that can manage it.\nDespite its massive reserves, Venezuelan production is relatively puny and has been in decline for decades.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, when, as elsewhere in Latin America and the Middle East, American and British oil companies controlled the industry, production peaked at around 3.5 million barrels a day - around 7% of global output.\nFollowing the election of Hugo Chavez and the nationalisation of the industry, production fell, declining further under his successor Nicolas Maduro and plummeting after the imposition of sanctions in 2019.\nToday, Venezuela produces less than one million barrels a day, almost all of which is exported to China, under exemption as repayment for historic loans, and the United States, which has granted oil major Chevron a licence to operate in the country.\nDonald Trump says US oil companies will spend billions to reverse that decline, but changing course will take time.\nVenezuela's oil infrastructure has declined through lack of investment and there has been a brain drain of expertise from the domestic industry under Maduro.\nRead more:\nGeneral reveals how US captured Maduro\nWhy is Trump so interested in Venezuela's oil?\nConsultants Wood Mackenzie estimate that every additional half a million barrels of extra output will require $15bn-$20bn of investment.\nFor a sense of how long it might take to significantly increase production, we can look to a previous, albeit much larger episode of US adventurism - the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.\nSince the US-led invasion in 2003, Iraqi production has tripled from around 1.5mn barrels a day to almost 4.5m, but it has taken 20 years, and the wider conflict came at an enormous cost to regional stability.\nThe more immediate question is what impact regime change in Venezuela will have on the oil price when markets reopen this week.\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\nGiven the uncertainty over who is really in charge in Caracas, some volatility would not be a surprise, but the US seizure of Venezuelan tankers before Christmas had limited impact.\nOil prices have been falling for a year, down around 20% in 2025 as global demand decreased as economies slowed, leading to over-supply. It's likely that the prospect of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine will have more impact on prices than the promise of more Venezuelan crude in decades to come\nWhatever happens to markets in the short term, the broader question of whether American involvement in the oil trade amounts to a colonial asset grab, or will ultimately benefit the Venezuelan people, will take longer to resolve.", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/venezuela-has-the-worlds-largest-oil-reserves-but-can-trump-reverse-the-production-decline-13490273", "published_at": "2026-01-04T12:27:00+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

On third-and-4 from midfield and trailing by three, Jackson evaded a sack and let one fly to Zay Flowers, who caught it in stride for the long touchdown to give the Ravens a 17-13 lead. The Steelers weren't sweating, though, as they responded with an eight-play drive that ended with a touchdown by Kenneth Gainwell to take a 20-17 lead with 3:49 to go. But apparently, Jackson saved his best for last, finding Flowers again, this time for 64 yards to go up 24-20 with 2:20 remaining.\nThe Steelers quickly got across midfield, and on third-and-10, Aaron Rodgers found Calvin Austin wide open for a score with 55 seconds to go. However, Chris Boswell missed the extra point, and it was just a two-point lead. The Ravens took the kickoff to their own 47-yard line and had three timeouts — a golden opportunity.\nRAIDERS' JAMAL ADAMS, GIANTS' JAMEIS WINSTON GET IN SCREAMING MATCH DURING HEATED MOMENT ON SIDELINE\nJackson completed his first pass, but after an illegal formation and two incompletions, he faced a fourth-and-7. Jackson threw up a prayer, and Isaiah Likely high-pointed it for an unbelievable catch. Jackson took a knee to set up the field goal unit in the middle of the hashes with two seconds left, but it was for naught, as the Steelers were the ones celebrating a wide-right kick.\nThe scoring got started from an unlikely source, as Lamar Jackson found Devontez Walker for a 38-yard touchdown to take the early lead. Both teams then exchanged punts before the Steelers turned the ball over on downs, and the Ravens took advantage by kicking a field goal to go up 10-0 early in the second quarter. Pittsburgh answered with a field goal of its own for its first score.\nIn the final seconds of the first half, the Steelers benefited from a defensive penalty that put them at the 2-yard line with two seconds left. They opted to go for the touchdown instead of a field goal, but the decision backfired, as Kenneth Gainwell was stuffed as the clock hit zero.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nThankfully for them, the Steelers got the ball to start the second half, and they did not let their opening drive go to waste, finding the end zone to tie the game at 10. Then, in his first game back from a collapsed lung, T.J. Watt caught a batted ball at the line for an interception. Pittsburgh then added a field goal for its first lead of the game.\nThe Steelers, with 42-year-old Rodgers and a head coach in Mike Tomlin whom fans were ready to give up on, finished the season at 10-7 and will host the Houston Texans on Monday night in the wild-card round.\nFollow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ravens-season-ends-heartbreak-missed-walk-off-field-goal-gives-steelers-final-playoff-spot", "published_at": "2026-01-05T01:26:47-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Our government estimates that roughly 200 to 250 metric tons of cocaine is shipped out of the Latin American country annually. America, by virtue of its prosperity, is a favored destination.\nOn this basis alone, the incursion into Caracas was legal, justified, and legitimate.\nFROM BUS DRIVER TO DICTATOR: NICOLÁS MADURO’S RISE AND FALL IN VENEZUELA\nFor years, Maduro has led the notorious Cartel de los Soles, a violent drug cartel that is designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization responsible for murders, torture and crimes against humanity so egregious that even the United Nations recognized it.\nArticle II, Section 2 of our Constitution vests inherent powers in the president to unilaterally order armed forces into military actions. His command authority is supreme, and he may conduct campaigns and deploy operations by his own judgment.\nShort of a formal declaration of war, a president does not need prior authorization from Congress to act. That principle is embedded in our Constitution and has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court since the early founding of our Republic.\nJONATHAN TURLEY: MADURO OPERATION WAS LEGAL, BUT TRUMP MAKES IT COMPLICATED\nIn more modern times, the president’s authority over armed action has only expanded. Cases involving Truman, Clinton and Obama solidified presidential power to direct military operations without congressional consent.\nTrump had every legal and constitutional right to defend the United States against the transport of deadly illicit drugs and to arrest the man most responsible, who has been federally indicted for numerous crimes.\nAnd no, Trump did not violate the War Powers Act as some of his critics have alleged. The resolution that was passed in 1973 stipulates a reporting requirement to Congress within 48 hours of deploying forces into hostilities. It is not a prohibition to act.\nTRUMP ISSUES DIRECT WARNING TO VENEZUELA'S NEW LEADER DELCY RODRÍGUEZ FOLLOWING MADURO CAPTURE\nIndeed, it implicitly recognizes a president’s inherent power to use military force without specific congressional approval. Every single American president has done so since the end of World War II. Trump is no exception.\nThe \"Take Care Clause\"\nThe president has another authority at his disposal. The \"Take Care Clause\" in Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution mandates that the president \"shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\"\nTRUMP REVEALS VENEZUELA’S MADURO WAS CAPTURED IN ‘FORTRESS’-LIKE HOUSE: ‘HE GOT BUM RUSHED SO FAST’\nTo put it simply, Trump is duty-bound to ensure that all federal statutes are enforced. This includes the apprehension, arrest, and prosecution of wanted fugitives who are criminally charged with U.S. crimes and must be brought to justice.\nEffectuating the arrest of Maduro qualifies as enforcing all laws. Just because the accused is the de facto head of state in another country does not afford him protection or immunity from the long arm of American law. That is written nowhere.\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Maduro as \"a fugitive of American justice.\" Given his armed protection, military troops were necessary to accomplish his arrest. According to Trump, the \"operation was done in conjunction with U.S. law enforcement.\"\nThis was also the case in 1990 under nearly identical circumstances.\nThen-President George H. W. Bush ordered the military to capture Manuel Noriega, the corrupt dictator of Panama who was indicted on drug trafficking charges and endangering U.S. citizens. After a surprise military operation in the country’s capital, he was taken into custody and spirited back to the U.S. for trial.\nNoriega’s legal team of defense attorneys vigorously challenged both his arrest and America’s legal authority to try him. Those maneuvers failed, along with his various claims of immunity. He was convicted and imprisoned.\nWHAT IS DELTA FORCE AND WHAT DO THEY DO? INSIDE THE ELITE US ARMY UNIT THAT CAPTURED MADURO\nSo, we’ve seen this movie before. Maduro’s lawyers will mount the same legal challenges. But if the past is prologue, there is little reason to believe that the ending will be any different.\nThis leaves the rather vacant claim by Trump adversaries that his actions somehow violated the norms and customs of international law. It is a common accusation that is often lacking in substance.\nSome point to Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, which prohibits member nations from \"the use of force against the territorial integrity\" of any state. However, the Charter provides an exception for self-defense.\nJONATHAN TURLEY: WHY CAPTURE OF MADURO DIDN'T REQUIRE APPROVAL FROM CONGRESS\nAs evidenced by the charges stated in Madura’s indictment, his actions as a narco-terrorist flooding the U.S. with deadly drugs fully justifies Trump’s actions as defensive in nature. Continued drug trafficking posed an imminent threat to the lives of American citizens.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIf a conflict of American versus international law exists, our president’s obligations under Article II of the Constitution takes precedence and priority over Article 2 of the U.N.

Carolina would have clinched the division with a win, but following their loss, neither team controlled its own destiny anymore.\nInstead, both of their playoff fates came down to Sunday’s matchup between the New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons – Tampa Bay needed the Saints to win or tie, while the Panthers were Falcons fans for the day.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\nIt will likely be a while until Panthers fans root for the Falcons again, but they sure owe Atlanta a ton after the Falcons beat the Saints to give Carolina the NFC South title and simultaneously knock out the Bucs.\nThe Falcons got on the board first, just two plays after blocking a Saints punt and recovering it at New Orleans’ 5-yard line.

The origins of Hezbollah’s presence in Venezuela date back to the mid-1980s, when the organization began recruiting members from segments of the local Lebanese diaspora.\"\nHe noted that Hezbollah gained greater traction following the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez’s consolidation of power in 2002. \"During this period, Hezbollah’s presence became more visible, with reports indicating that some of its members gained access to Venezuelan state institutions, including security agencies, often through the acquisition of Venezuelan passports and legal documentation. These developments facilitated the expansion of Hezbollah-linked networks throughout Latin America, extending into Brazil, Argentina and Chile, and reportedly reaching as far as the U.S.–Mexico border.\"\nPhares said, \"Hezbollah is believed to maintain a substantial presence across Venezuela, including command-and-control elements in Caracas.

He said, \"One option would be to rely on a post-Maduro transitional authority that has pledged to dismantle terrorist networks. In practice, however, it is likely that U.S. intelligence and counterterrorism agencies would play a leading role in identifying and disrupting pro-Iranian networks operating within Venezuelan territory.\"\nMatthew Levitt, a scholar on Hezbollah from the Washington Institute, told Fox News Digital, \"It will all come down to what kind of regime comes next.

Sometimes, they just need the right words in the right place. OpenAI is now openly acknowledging that reality. The company says prompt injection attacks against artificial intelligence (AI)-powered browsers are not a bug that can be fully patched, but a long-term risk that comes with letting AI agents roam the open web. This raises uncomfortable questions about how safe these tools really are, especially as they gain more autonomy and access to your data.\nSign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\nGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you’ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide — free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.\nNEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY\nWhy prompt injection isn't going away\nIn a recent blog post, OpenAI admitted that prompt injection attacks are unlikely to ever be completely eliminated. Prompt injection works by hiding instructions inside web pages, documents or emails in ways that humans don't notice, but AI agents do. Once the AI reads that content, it can be tricked into following malicious instructions.\nOpenAI compared this problem to scams and social engineering. You can reduce them, but you can't make them disappear. The company also acknowledged that \"agent mode\" in its ChatGPT Atlas browser increases risk because it expands the attack surface. The more an AI can do on your behalf, the more damage it can cause when something goes wrong.\nOpenAI launched the ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers immediately started testing its limits. Within hours, demos appeared showing that a few carefully placed words inside a Google Doc could influence how the browser behaved. That same day, Brave published its own warning, explaining that indirect prompt injection is a structural problem for AI-powered browsers, including tools like Perplexity's Comet.\nThis isn't just OpenAI's problem. Earlier this month, the National Cyber Security Centre in the U.K. warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI systems may never be fully mitigated.\nFAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE\nThe risk trade-off with AI browsers\nOpenAI says it views prompt injection as a long-term security challenge that requires constant pressure, not a one-time fix. Its approach relies on faster patch cycles, continuous testing and layered defenses. That puts it broadly in line with rivals like Anthropic and Google, which have both argued that agentic systems need architectural controls and ongoing stress testing.\nWhere OpenAI is taking a different approach is with something it calls an \"LLM-based automated attacker.\" In simple terms, OpenAI trained an AI to act like a hacker. Using reinforcement learning, this attacker bot looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions into an AI agent's workflow.\nThe bot runs attacks in simulation first. It predicts how the target AI would reason, what steps it would take and where it might fail. Based on that feedback, it refines the attack and tries again. Because this system has insight into the AI's internal decision-making, OpenAI believes it can surface weaknesses faster than real-world attackers.\nEven with these defenses, AI browsers aren't safe. They combine two things attackers love: autonomy and access. Unlike regular browsers, they don't just display information, but also read emails, scan documents, click links and take actions on your behalf. That means a single malicious prompt hidden in a webpage, document or message can influence what the AI does without you ever seeing it. Even when safeguards are in place, these agents operate by trusting content at scale, and that trust can be manipulated.\nTHIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS\n7 steps you can take to reduce risk with AI browsers\nYou may not be able to eliminate prompt injection attacks, but you can significantly limit their impact by changing how you use AI tools.\n1) Limit what the AI browser can access\nOnly give an AI browser access to what it absolutely needs. Avoid connecting your primary email account, cloud storage or payment methods unless there's a clear reason. The more data an AI can see, the more valuable it becomes to attackers. Limiting access reduces the blast radius if something goes wrong.\n2) Require confirmation for every sensitive action\nNever allow an AI browser to send emails, make purchases or modify account settings without asking you first. Confirmation breaks long attack chains and gives you a moment to spot suspicious behavior. Many prompt injection attacks rely on the AI acting quietly in the background without user review.\n3) Use a password manager for all accounts\nA password manager ensures every account has a unique, strong password. If an AI browser or malicious page leaks one credential, attackers can't reuse it elsewhere. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on unfamiliar or suspicious sites, which can alert you that something isn't right before you manually enter anything.\nNext, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.\nCheck out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com\n4) Run strong antivirus software on your device\nEven if an attack starts inside the browser, antivirus software can still detect suspicious scripts, unauthorized system changes or malicious network activity. Strong antivirus software focuses on behavior, not just files, which is critical when dealing with AI-driven or script-based attacks.\nThe best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\nGet my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com\n5) Avoid broad or open-ended instructions\nTelling an AI browser to \"handle whatever is needed\" gives attackers room to manipulate it through hidden prompts. Be specific about what the AI is allowed to do and what it should never do. Narrow instructions make it harder for malicious content to influence the agent.\n6) Be careful with AI summaries and automated scans\nWhen an AI browser scans emails, documents or web pages for you, remember that hidden instructions can live inside that content. Treat AI-generated actions as drafts or suggestions, not final decisions. Review anything the AI plans to act on before approving it.\n7) Keep your browser, AI tools and operating system updated\nSecurity fixes for AI browsers evolve quickly as new attack techniques emerge. Delaying updates leaves known weaknesses open longer than necessary. Turning on automatic updates ensures you get protection as soon as they're available, even if you miss the announcement.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nKurt's key takeaway\nThere's been a meteoric rise in AI browsers. We're now seeing them from major tech companies, including OpenAI's Atlas, The Browser Company's Dia and Perplexity's Comet. Even existing browsers like Chrome and Edge are pushing hard to add AI and agentic features into their current infrastructure. While these browsers can be useful, the technology is still early. It's best not to fall for the hype and to wait for it to mature.\nDo you think AI browsers are worth the risk today, or are they moving faster than security can keep up?

The research comes from a team of academic scientists working in robotics and artificial intelligence, and it tackles one of the field's biggest limitations.\nThe researchers taught a robot to learn 1,000 different physical tasks in a single day using just one demonstration per task. These were not small variations of the same movement. The tasks included placing, folding, inserting, gripping and manipulating everyday objects in the real world. For robotics, that is a big deal.\nWhy robots have always been slow learners\nUntil now, teaching robots physical tasks has been painfully inefficient. Even simple actions often require hundreds or thousands of demonstrations. Engineers must collect massive datasets and fine-tune systems behind the scenes. That is why most factory robots repeat one motion endlessly and fail as soon as conditions change. Humans learn differently. If someone shows you how to do something once or twice, you can usually figure it out. That gap between human learning and robot learning has held robotics back for decades. This research aims to close that gap.\nTHE NEW ROBOT THAT COULD MAKE CHORES A THING OF THE PAST\nHow the robot learned 1,000 tasks so fast\nThe breakthrough comes from a smarter way of teaching robots to learn from demonstrations. Instead of memorizing entire movements, the system breaks tasks into simpler phases. One phase focuses on aligning with the object, and the other handles the interaction itself. This method relies on artificial intelligence, specifically an AI technique called imitation learning that allows robots to learn physical tasks from human demonstrations.\nThe robot then reuses knowledge from previous tasks and applies it to new ones. This retrieval-based approach allows the system to generalize rather than start from scratch each time. Using this method, called Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer, the researchers trained a real robot arm on 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstration time.\nImportantly, this was not done in a simulation. It happened in the real world, with real objects, real mistakes and real constraints. That detail matters.\nWhy this research feels different\nMany robotics papers look impressive on paper but fall apart outside perfect lab conditions. This one stands out because it tested the system through thousands of real-world rollouts. The robot also showed it could handle new object instances it had never seen before. That ability to generalize is what robots have been missing. It is the difference between a machine that repeats and one that adapts.\nAI VIDEO TECH FAST-TRACKS HUMANOID ROBOT TRAINING\nA long-standing robotics problem may finally be cracking\nThis research addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in robotics: inefficient learning from demonstrations. By decomposing tasks and reusing knowledge, the system achieved an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency compared to traditional approaches. That kind of leap rarely happens overnight. It suggests that the robot-filled future we have talked about for years may be nearer than it looked even a few years ago.\nWhat this means for you\nFaster learning changes everything. If robots need less data and less programming, they become cheaper and more flexible. That opens the door to robots working outside tightly controlled environments.\nIn the long run, this could enable home robots to learn new tasks from simple demonstrations instead of specialist code. It also has major implications for healthcare, logistics and manufacturing.\nMore broadly, it signals a shift in artificial intelligence. We are moving away from flashy tricks and toward systems that learn in more human-like ways. Not smarter than people. Just closer to how we actually operate day to day.\nTake my quiz: How safe is your online security?\nThink your devices and data are truly protected?

Still, it represents real progress on a problem that has limited robotics for decades. When machines start learning more like humans, the conversation changes. The question shifts from what robots can repeat to what they can adapt to next.

At least 40 people, including civilians and Venezuelan military members, died in the attack, the New York Times reported.\nCharging papers against Maduro allege that he helmed a “corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking”.\nThe arrests came after months of US pressure against Maduro, which included attacks on alleged “narco boats”. These boat strikes resulted in at least 110 deaths and some legal experts have questioned whether the strikes are tantamount to war crimes.\nIn the weeks leading up to this attack, the US also seized sanctioned oil tankers off Venezuela’s coast. Donald Trump established a blockade against other such vessels, further constraining the oil-rich nation’s already flagging economy.\nMaduro’s son and three others are also charged in the indictment. Maduro, who was indicted during Trump’s first presidency, faces charges of narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.\nTrump, who previously vowed to avoid foreign wars, said that the US will control Venezuela for the time being. “We will run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump said during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n“We can’t take a chance that someone else takes over Venezuela who doesn’t have the interests of Venezuelans in mind,” he also told reporters, describing the military action as “an assault like people have not seen since world war two”.\nTop Democrats condemned Trump’s attack on Venezuela, calling it illegal and contrary to US interests. The US constitution mandates that only Congress has the power to declare war. Presidents must seek approval for military operations from Congress under the 1973 War Powers Resolution.\n“They literally lied to our face,” Democratic Connecticut senator Chris Murphy said on Sunday. He was referencing a briefing on Venezuela given to Congress by secretary of state Marco Rubio in December. “The message they sent was that this wasn’t about regime change … They said this is just a counter-narcotics operation.”\nTrump also told reporters that the US would take control over Venezuela’s oil industry. “We’re going to have our very large US oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country and we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.”\nTrump’s plans for administering Venezuela are unclear. American forces do not control Venezuela, and Maduro’s government still seems to be running the country.\nTrump has claimed the US would control Venezuela “with a group” and is “designating various people” for leadership roles. The US president also commented that he wasn’t opposed to deploying ground forces there.\n“We’re not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to … We had boots on the ground last night at a very high level, actually. We’re not afraid of it. We don’t mind saying it but we’re going to make sure that country is run properly.

It’s for the United States to lay out its legal basis for this operation.”\nTapp also would not say whether the British government believed Washington had breached international law, and said there was a need to have “all the facts” amid the “fog of war”.\nMarkets are reacting to the turmoil over Venezuela and the US actions, with investors seeking the safe haven of gold and buying up shares in defence companies. But with Donald Trump making Venezuela’s oil reserves central to his plans for the country, the price of crude is falling. You can follow the market reaction in our business blog with my colleague, Graeme Wearden, here:\nProsecutors say Nicolás Maduro is the kingpin of a cartel of Venezuelan political and military officials who have conspired for decades with drug trafficking groups and US-designated terrorist organisations to flood America with thousands of tonnes of cocaine.\nAs Reuters reports, Maduro was first indicted in 2020 as part of a long-running narcotics trafficking case against current and former Venezuelan officials and Colombian guerrillas.\nIn a new indictment unsealed Saturday, prosecutors allege that Maduro personally oversaw a state-sponsored cocaine trafficking network that partnered with some of the world’s most violent and prolific drug trafficking groups, including Mexico’s Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, the Colombian paramilitary group FARC and the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\nMaduro is charged with narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices. He faces decades to life in prison on each count if convicted.\nLegal experts said prosecutors face a difficult task, needing to show evidence of Maduro’s direct involvement in drug trafficking to secure a conviction.\nMaduro has denied wrongdoing, and it could be several months before he stands trial.\nVenezuela’s president was captured, flown to the US and is now facing trial in New York. What does the audacious ouster of Nicolás Maduro mean for the country – and the world?\nColombian president Gustavo Petro has rejected threats by Donald Trump and the US president’s accusations that he is drug trafficker.\nTrump on Sunday threatened Colombia with similar military action to the weekend raid against Venezuela, saying Colombia was “run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States” but that he “is not going to be doing it very long”.\nPetro rebuffed the accusations, saying his “name does not appear in court records”.\n“Stop slandering me, Mr. Trump,” Petro said on X on Sunday.\nThat’s not how you threaten a Latin American president who emerged from the armed struggle and then from the people of Colombia’s fight for Peace.\nPetro has harshly criticised the Trump administration’s military action in the region and accused Washington of abducting Maduro “without legal basis”, as Agence France-Presse reports. In a later post to X on Sunday, Petro added that “friends do not bomb”.\nAnalysis: European leaders appear torn in face of new world order\nPatrick Wintour\nEuropean leaders emerged divided and torn as they tried to welcome the ejection of Venezuela’s authoritarian president but still uphold the principles of international law that did not appear to allow Donald Trump to seize Nicolás Maduro, let alone declare that the US will run Venezuela and control its oil industry.\nEurope tried to focus on the principle of a democratic transition, pointing out that the continent had not recognised Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela since what were widely regarded as fraudulent elections in June 2024.\nBut Trump’s rejection of the Nobel prize-winning Venezuelan opposition figurehead, María Corina Machado, was awkward. Trump said she did not have support or respect in Venezuela, but European leaders have embraced her as leading an opposition that deserves power.\nDonald Trump has threatened a second American strike on Venezuela if remaining members of its government do not cooperate with his efforts to get the country “fixed”.\nIn comments aboard Air Force One, the president also says the US is now “in charge” of Venezuela and praises the US forces involved in what he called a “very dangerous operation” to capture Maduro.\nKeir Starmer has said when asked if he would condemn the US action in Venezuela that he wants to wait to “establish the facts” and speak to Donald Trump, while insisting the UK would “shed no tears” over the end of Maduro’s regime.\nHowever, some of the British prime minister’s own MPs have been more outspoken, criticising America’s actions as a breach of international law.\nLabour MP Kim Johnson questioned whether “we as a country still stand for international law and sovereignty”, while her colleague Richard Burgon described Starmer’s statement as “shameful and reckless”.\nFormer shadow chancellor John McDonnell said that “effectively our country has been rendered up as a Trump colony”, accusing the government of “prevarication”.\nIn a post on X, Labour MP Clive Lewis said of the US military operation: “A clear breach of the Nuremberg principles – which the UK helped write.\nNow a [Labour government] won’t even defend them. This silence isn’t diplomacy. It’s the moral equivalent of a white flag.\nHello and welcome to our live coverage after US forces seized Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in Caracas and took him to the US to face drug charges.\nDonald Trump said after the military operation early on Saturday that the US would “run” Venezuela and warned on Sunday that the US might launch a second strike if the government’s remaining members did not cooperate with his efforts to get the country “fixed”.\nVenezuelan vice-president and Maduro ally Delcy Rodríguez has been appointed acting president and offered “to collaborate” with the Trump administration in what could be a major shift in relations between the governments.\nIn a conciliatory message on Instagram on Sunday she said she hoped to build “respectful relations” with Trump.\n“We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence,” Rodríguez said.\nIn a televised address earlier Rodríguez gave no indication she would cooperate with Trump, saying what was being done to Venezuela was “an atrocity that violates international law”, referring to Trump’s government as “extremists” and maintaining that Maduro was Venezuela’s rightful leader.\nBut Trump warned later that if Rodríguez didn’t fall in line, “she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro”.\nIn other key developments:\nRodríguez announced a commission to seek the release of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.\nMaduro is in a New York detention centre awaiting a court appearance on Monday on drug charges.\nTop officials in Maduro’s government called the seizure of Maduro and his wife a kidnapping. “Let no one fall for the enemy’s provocations,” interior minister Diosdado Cabello said.\nTrump’s administration described Maduro’s capture as a law-enforcement mission to force him to face US criminal charges filed in 2020, including narco-terrorism conspiracy. Maduro has denied criminal involvement.\nMaduro’s son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra, reportedly said his father’s supporters were more resolved than ever to support Maduro and the ousted president would return. “We will take to the streets, we will convene the people.”\nTrump suggested Colombia and Mexico could also face military action if they did not reduce the flow of illicit drugs to the US, saying: “Operation Colombia sounds good to me.”\nImages of the 63-year-old Maduro blindfolded and handcuffed stunned Venezuelans. The operation was Washington’s most controversial intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama 37 years ago.\nVenezuelan defence minister Gen Vladimir Padrino said on state television the US attack killed soldiers, civilians and a “large part” of Maduro’s security detail “in cold blood”. Venezuela’s armed forces had been activated to guarantee sovereignty, he said.\nThe Cuban government said 32 of its citizens were killed during the raid.\nThe governments of Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay said in a joint statement the US actions “constitute an extremely dangerous precedent for peace and regional security and endanger the civilian population”.\nAll EU countries except Hungary issued a statement calling for restraint by “all actors” and respect for the will of the Venezuelan people in order to “restore democracy”.\nUK prime minister Keir Starmer said Britain was not involved in the attack but refused to condemn it. British cabinet minister Darren Jones – a close ally of Starmer –called for a peaceful transition of power in Venezuela to be reached “quickly”.\nTrump suggested the US would not push for immediate elections to install a new government but rather would work with remaining members of the Maduro administration to clamp down on drug trafficking and overhaul its oil industry. He said US oil companies needed “total access” to the country’s vast reserves.\nHundreds of Chavismo supporters gathered in Caracus on Sunday to demand the release of Maduro and Flores.

Whenever the United States attacks another country like this, it’s the peoples of those countries who suffer the most,” Andy Thayer of the Chicago Committee Against War and Racism said to a local ABC affiliate at a protest that drew several hundred.\nOthers argued that Donald Trump did not have authority to launch such a strike on Venezuela, at least without approval from Congress. Senior Democrats on Sunday decried the US president’s bypassing his constitutional obligation to involve the congressional branch of government, as international leaders said the US had breached the United Nations charter.\nAt a protest in Seattle organized by a group called Answer (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism), crowds held signs with statements such as “No Blood for Oil” and “Stop Bombing Venezuela Now!”\n“We’re out here to show solidarity with a country whose sovereignty and self determination has been violated by our government using our tax dollars,” Taylor Young, an organizer with Answer, which staged protests in several other cities, too, told a Fox News affiliate.\n“So the very least we can do is come out in Seattle and across the country to say we won’t allow you to do this while we just stand by,” Young added.\nRepublican lawmakers broadly continued to support Trump and praised his actions even as senior figures walked back the president’s assertions on Saturday that the US “will run” Venezuela during a transition to a new regime.\nCongressman Tom Emmer, a Republican from Minnesota, said Sunday morning on Fox News: “God bless this president of peace, Donald J Trump.”\nBut protesters also spoke out against the deportations of Venezuelans living in the country. “We’re creating wars, we’re creating chaos and then simultaneously abducting our neighbors and sending them back to the very countries that we’re destabilizing,” Olivia DiNucci, an anti-war organizer with activist group Code Pink, told WHYY, a public radio station in Philadelphia.\nDespite bipartisan condemnation of Maduro as a dictator, some activists also called for his release.\nProtesters gathered outside the detention center in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, where the captured president is being held and chanted: “Free Maduro right now.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/04/venezuela-trump-protests-us-cities", "published_at": "2026-01-05T08:25:12+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

On Sunday, he warned the US might launch a second strike if remaining members of the administration do not cooperate with his efforts to get the country “fixed.”\nRodríguez, 56, had on Saturday pledged fealty to Maduro and condemned his capture as an “atrocity”, but on Sunday called for a “balanced and respectful” relationship with the US.\n“We extend an invitation to the US government to work together on an agenda for cooperation that is aimed toward shared development,” Rodríguez said after holding her first cabinet meeting since Maduro’s ouster.\nThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, spoke to Rodríguez, who told him “‘we’ll do whatever you need’”, Trump told reporters.\n“She, I think, was quite gracious, but she really doesn’t have a choice.” The New York Times reported that Trump officials several weeks ago identified the technocrat as a potential successor and business partner partly on the basis of her relationship with Wall Street and oil companies.\nIn the capital, Caracas, senior government and military figures demanded the return of Maduro but pledged support for Rodríguez as a stand-in leader and called for a return to normality.\n“I call on the people of Venezuela to resume their activities of all kinds, economic, work and education, in the coming days,” Vladimir Padrino López, the defence minister, said in a televised address.\nMaduro’s son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra, said his father’s supporters are more resolved than ever to support the ousted president, according to an audio shared on social media.\n“They will not see us weak,” Maduro Guerra said. “The president, Nicolás Maduro, will return … we will take to the streets, we will convene the people, we will unite.”\nIn comments to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump raised the possibility of further US interventions in Latin America, and suggested Colombia and Mexico could also face military action if they do not reduce the flow of illicit drugs to the United States.\n“Operation Colombia sounds good to me,” Trump said. He also said that Cuba, a close ally of Venezuela, “looks like it’s ready to fall” on its own without US military action.\nEarlier on Sunday, Trump said the US may intervene in other countries as well. “We do need Greenland, absolutely.” Katie Miller, the wife of Trump’s deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, posted a social media picture of Greenland painted in the colours of the US flag, and the word “soon”, prompting a protest from Greenland’s prime minister.\nIn a round of TV interviews Rubio downplayed the possibility of invasion or occupation of Venezuela, but confirmed that the US was keeping a 15,000-strong force in the Caribbean.\n“There’s not a war. I mean, we are at war against drug trafficking organisations, not a war against Venezuela. We don’t have US forces on the ground,” he told NBC.\nTroops were in Caracas for two hours in a “law enforcement function” that did not require congressional approval, he said. “This was not an invasion. This was not an extended military operation.”\nThe US will keep a “quarantine” around Venezuela to block the entry and exit of oil tankers under American sanctions to sustain “leverage” over Maduro’s successor, said Rubio. “We are going to make our assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly.”\nHe said the Cuban government – Venezuela’s main ally – was a “huge problem” and in a “lot of trouble” but declined to elaborate.\nThe Cuban government confirmed on Sunday that the US operation in Venezuela killed 32 Cuban military and police officers were who were there at the request of the government in Caracas.\nThe governments of Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay said in a joint statement that US actions “constitute an extremely dangerous precedent for peace and regional security and endanger the civilian population”. Keir Starmer said Britain was not involved in the attack but refused to condemn it.\nAll EU countries except Hungary issued a statement calling for restraint by “all actors” and respect for the will of the Venezuelan people in order to “restore democracy”.\nIn Caracas some shops and cafes reopened in a semblance of normality while authorities counted the cost of Saturday’s raid.\nLarge queues formed outside stores in Venezuela’s capital as anxious residents stocked up on basic supplies, apprehensive about what the future might bring and the possibility – suggested by Trump – that there could be a “second wave” of attacks.\n“It’s the same everywhere, there are queues in the supermarkets, there are queues in the bakeries, queues at the pharmacy,” said one 71-year-old pensioner who was one of 20 people lined up outside a small family grocery market in north-east Caracas on Sunday morning.\n“There’s so much uncertainty because people don’t know what might happen in the coming days and nobody wants to see another situation like the early hours of Saturday or to be caught with their pants down and an empty fridge,” added the man, who asked not to be named.\nOutside one of Venezuela’s largest supermarket chains in Petare, on the east side of Caracas, a young couple waited in a 100-person-long line outside a supermarket in order to stock up on milk, butter and flour. So many people had flocked there that supermarket workers were letting in shoppers in groups.\n“[I feel] angry,” said the 23-year-old woman, who gave only her first name, Sauriany. “They don’t have the right to meddle like this in another country and to do whatever they like,” she said of the US raid.\nIn neighbouring Colombia there was deep unease too, with its president, Gustavo Petro, ordering 30,000 troops to its eastern border with Venezuela in case there was violence or a sudden influx of refugees.\nOn Sunday, Trump said Colombia was “very sick” and run by a “sick man”. He accused Petro of producing and selling cocaine to the US, adding: “He’s not going to be doing it very long.”\nAsked directly whether the US would pursue a military operation against the country, Trump answered, “It sounds good to me.”\nPetro on Sunday rebuffed the accusations saying in a post online: “Stop slandering me, Mr. Trump.”\n“That’s not how you threaten a Latin American president who emerged from the armed struggle and then from the people of Colombia’s fight for Peace,” he said.\nPetro has previously said his government has been seizing cocaine at unprecedented rates and last month he invited Trump to visit and see government efforts to destroy drug-producing labs.\nOver the weekend, US authorities unsealed a four-count indictment that charges Maduro with narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. It also charges Flores, their son and two Venezuelan officials and an alleged leader of Tren de Aragua, a gang the Trump administration has designed a terrorist organisation. Maduro is due to appear in a Manhattan federal court on Monday for arraignment.\nThe White House shared footage of the deposed dictator handcuffed and doing a “perp walk” to Drug Enforcement Administration offices in New York before being taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.\nThe prosecution will deepen the humiliation felt by Maduro loyalists and complicate the balancing act faced by his successor.\nRodríguez, who served as vice-president and oil minister until her boss’s removal, must juggle Washington’s demands for oil and security guarantees with a regime that retains vestiges of the socialism and anti-imperialism of its late founder, Hugo Chávez.\nThe Trump administration’s apparent satisfaction with regime tweak, rather than regime change, has dismayed those Venezuelans who hoped Maduro’s downfall would usher in democracy.\nTrump was dismissive about the opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, the Nobel peace prize winner who mobilised Edmundo González’s winning presidential campaign last year, and said she lacked “support” in Venezuela. Millions of Venezuelans revere Machado but she is loathed by the military hierarchy that props up the regime.\nRubio said the US wanted a transition to democracy but ruled out elections in the short term and said those in charge of Venezuela’s military and police apparatus needed to decide in which direction they go. “We hope they will chose a different direction than the one Nicolás Maduro picked. Ultimately we hope this leads to a holistic transition.”\nIn Caracas joggers and cyclists reappeared on streets but residents expressed nervousness and uncertainty about the future.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/04/us-running-venezuela-now-seems-less-likely-but-second-intervention-possible", "published_at": "2026-01-05T07:41:53+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Over the weekend, the US attacked Venezuela with a series of airstrikes and captured the country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, along with his wife, Cilia Flores, seizing them from their bedrooms and flying them to New York on Saturday evening. Donald Trump announced that the US would “run” Venezuela for an unspecified period.\nPerhaps most striking was how explicit Trump was about the reasoning behind the military action. He said the aim was for US companies to take control of Venezuela’s oil infrastructure for their own benefit. “We have the greatest oil companies in the world, the biggest, the greatest, and we’re going to be very much involved in it,” Trump said.\nThe US president also told reporters that Venezuela’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, would remain in power only so long as she “does what we want”. He threatened a second, larger wave of military strikes if the country’s leaders refused to comply.\nVenezuelan officials have vowed defiance. At least 40 people, including civilians and soldiers, were reportedly killed in Saturday’s attack.\nHow did we get here, and what happens next for Venezuela? Today, I speak to the Guardian’s Latin America correspondent, Tom Phillips. That’s after the headlines.\nFive big stories\n-\nVenezuela | The prospect of the United States seizing direct control of Venezuela appeared to recede on Sunday after the shocking seizure of President Nicolás Maduro – but US officials said Washington was keeping a 15,000-strong force in the Caribbean and might make a fresh military intervention if Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, did not accommodate their demands.\n-\nEU | Keir Starmer has said closer ties with the EU single market are preferable to a customs union in his clearest sign yet that the UK government is seeking to further deepen links with Brussels.\n-\nWeather | Transport delays, treacherous driving conditions and school closures will greet many people as they return to work and study after the Christmas break, with winter weather warnings in place across the UK.\n-\nCrans-Montana fire | Investigators have identified the last 16 people who died in the New Year’s Eve bar fire at the Swiss mountain resort of Crans-Montana, police said on Sunday.\n-\nGermany | German leftwing militants protesting over the climate crisis and AI have claimed responsibility for an arson attack that cut power to tens of thousands of households in Berlin.\nIn depth: ‘The images look like Baghdad in 2003’\nThe relationship between the US and Venezuela began to deteriorate in the late 1990s, following the election of the now deceased socialist firebrand Hugo Chávez. According to Tom Phillips, an early, US-backed attempt to remove Chávez in a 2002 coup deepened suspicion and hostility on both sides.\nBut after Chávez died of cancer in 2013, relations worsened significantly with the election of Nicolás Maduro as president. “He then led the country rapidly into economic meltdown, a mass migration crisis, and in an increasingly authoritarian direction,” Tom says, pointing in particular to the controversial 2018 election result.\nIn 2019, shortly after Maduro was sworn in for a second term, the Trump administration launched what it called a “maximum pressure” campaign, combining sweeping sanctions with repeated military threats and an early effort to topple him.\nThere had been signs of a thaw at the start of Trump’s second term. The US sent a special envoy, Richard Grenell, to Caracas for talks, deportation flights continued until very recently, and oil production involving the US company Chevron carried on. But tensions escalated sharply in the months running-up to this attack. Trump had sought a blockade of Venezuelan oil, expanded sanctions against the Maduro government, and staged more than two dozen strikes on vessels the US alleges were involved in trafficking drugs, killing more than 110 people.\n“Everyone is flabbergasted that this has happened,” Tom says. “There have been months of threats and significant military hardware deployed to the region. But most observers, and probably Maduro himself, thought this was a bluff or a negotiating tactic to force him from power or trigger a military coup.\n“Instead, it’s come to this, in such a spectacular fashion. The images from Saturday look like Baghdad in 2003.”\nDrill baby drill\nIn 2020, a US federal court indicted Maduro on narco-terrorism and other charges, accusing him of running a scheme to ship tonnes of cocaine to the US through what prosecutors described as the Cartel de los Soles. Maduro has always denied the allegations. The superseding indictment unsealed last weekend, immediately after his capture, closely mirrors those 2020 charges. After Maduro and his wife arrived in New York, the Trump administration released images of his arrival into custody, known as a “perp walk.” The move was widely seen as an effort to further discredit him as Venezuela’s leader.\nTrump’s team has sought to frame the operation as a war on drug trafficking. But how credible is that explanation?\n“Maduro is widely believed to have stolen the 2024 election, but serious analysts don’t see convincing evidence that he is a narco-terrorist or that he is deliberately flooding the US with drugs,” Tom says.\nThe audacious military operation comes just weeks after the Nobel peace prize was awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado. But instead of backing Machado, or the popular opposition figure Edmundo González, Trump sidelined them, declaring that the US would temporarily take control of Venezuela while American companies moved in to run its oil infrastructure.\n“The word democracy is hardly mentioned at all,” Tom says. “The Trump administration has made it very clear that this is about drugs, it’s about migration, and they’ve said this openly, it is about their desire to further exploit and profit from Venezuelan oil. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves on earth.”\nThe United States of Venezuela\nIn characteristically Trumpian fashion, the US president announced that the US would now “run” Venezuela, without explaining how, or on what legal basis, such an arrangement would work. When I spoke to Tom, he was travelling to the Colombian border with Venezuela. He said that while about 15,000 US troops are deployed across the wider region, none are now stationed inside Venezuela.\n“It’s mind-boggling,” Tom said. “Trump declares ‘we are going to run Venezuela now’, but it’s completely unclear how he plans to do that, especially given his supposed aversion to putting boots on the ground. How do you govern a country of nearly 30 million people with vast territory, including a huge Amazon region?”\nVenezuela, it’s worth noting, is roughly twice the size of Iraq. When Trump was pushed at his press conference about past failures in US nation-building, he brushed them aside, saying: “That’s where we had different presidents. With me, that’s not true,” he said. “With me, we’ve had a perfect track record of winning.”\nBut analysts are less convinced. “Even if you were prepared to put those 15,000 troops on the ground in Venezuela, most people don’t think that would be sufficient to occupy and control such a complex territory,” Tom said.\nThe prospect of the United States seizing direct control of Venezuela appeared to recede on Sunday, but US officials said Washington was keeping 15,00 troops in the Caribbean and might make a fresh military intervention if Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, did not accommodate their demands.\nTrump’s military action and declarationshave drawn mixed reactions across Latin America. “There have been messages of support, Chile’s incoming far-right president has backed the move,” Tom said. “But more moderate leaders, including Brazil’s President Lula and Chile’s outgoing president Gabriel Boric, have condemned it. There has also been real concern among diplomats in the region about the US simply going into and taking its leader, irrespective of his democratic credentials.”\nGlobally, the response has followed a similar pattern. The operation has been condemned by Russia, China and Iran, and much of the global south, while Europe’s reaction has been muted. UK prime minister Keir Starmer declined to criticise the action, while stressing that Britain played no role in it.\nIn the US, the action was welcomed by Republicans, but widely condemned by Democrats. The former US vice-president, Kamala Harris, described it as “unlawful and unwise”, actions that “do not make America safer, stronger, or more affordable”.\nSuccession\nThe country’s supreme court has declared the vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, to be the interim leader. And “it seems from the press conference that Trump is prepared to do business with her even though she was one of Maduro’s closest allies,” Tom said.\nWhat remains unclear is in what capacity. Will Washington effectively govern Venezuela through Maduro’s former deputy? Or will another senior figure, perhaps from the military, emerge, leading to a pro-US interim regime?\nAmid the confusion, Tom says one thing is clear. “There’s no sign that the US is prepared to help Machado and González return from exile,” he said. “Trump was very dismissive of Machado in the press conference, which poured cold water on the Venezuelan opposition. They had hoped that once Maduro was gone they would be helped to take power.”\nAnalysis from the New York Times suggests the US may be pursuing a form of “guardianship”, dictating Venezuela’s political and economic direction through an interim government, backed by the threat of renewed military action. “Trump said that was the first wave of attacks and that there might be a second wave of bigger attacks ‘if we don’t get what we want,’” Tom said.\nWhether that threat alone is enough remains uncertain. Rodríguez, in televised address, had initially refused to comply. But she struck a more conciliatory tone in her most recent public statement on Sunday, offering “to collaborate” with the Trump administration, in what could be a major shift in relations between the governments.\n“Perhaps he’s prepared to call it a day with the images of Maduro in a blindfold and handcuffs projecting a narrative that he has affected some kind of political change,” Tom added, “but in reality it may remain close to the status quo with just a new Chavista leader calling the shots.”\nTrump’s press conference fell on the anniversary of the US capture of Panama’s dictator Manuel Noriega, who was flown into American custody after being accused of drug trafficking. But it was clear in that press conference that Trump is not interested in just invoking history, he is set on making it. And his actions will deepen fears that his talk of using military force to seize the Panama canal, take control of Greenland, or even make Canada the 51st state, can no longer be laughed off.\nWhat else we’ve been reading\n-\nBrigitte Bardot, who died over the Christmas period, may have wowed both on film and many a magazine cover, but Esther Addley explores the more complex legacy of an icon who wrote of Muslims: “one day they’ll slaughter us, and we’ll have deserved it”.

No one has been charged criminally with regard to the allegations in the lawsuit.\nTwo women in the US state Virginia have filed a class action seeking US$5m from e-casino Stake.com, the celebrities and another Australian internet personality for alleged breaches of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (Rico) and consumer protection laws.\nStake.com, a Curacao-licensed global e-casino, is officially banned in dozens of countries including the US, Australia and the UK.\nIts American arm, Stake.us, does not allow users to gamble directly with real money. Wagerers play with e-tokens – some are provided for free while others can be purchased and withdrawn as cryptocurrency.\nThe class action, filed on Wednesday, alleges Stake.us’s anonymised design enabled Drake to fund purchases of automated streams, artificially inflating his royalties and popularity on music streaming platforms, including Spotify.\nCourt documents allege Drake and Ross hid the financing from public view by transferring gambling winnings via Stake’s anonymised tip system to an Australian man, named in court documents as George Nguyen, who allegedly operates the online accounts grandwizardchatn**** and Grandavious.\nNguyen, who has posted promoting Drake and the gambling platform, allegedly traded between the Stake proceeds, cash and cryptocurrency to pay bot vendors for artificial music streams on behalf of Drake and Ross.\nThe lawsuit alleges Drake transferred millions of dollars as part of the scheme, including in the form of $100,000 and $10,000 tips to Ross. The lawsuit also alleges public posts, chat logs and leaked communications prove Nguyen’s role.\nThe class action claims the scheme dates back to 2022 and “remains an ongoing and imminent threat of racketeering activity”. Drake, Ross, Nguyen and Stake were contacted for comment.\nThe suit also alleges Stake, with Drake and Ross, deliberately misled consumers to believe the platform was legal and harmless.\nThe lead plaintiffs, Tiffany Hines and LaShawnna Ridley, alleged they suffered serious harm after Drake’s promotions encouraged them to gamble on Stake. The platform had financially harmed users by encouraging them to gamble illegally and leaving them vulnerable to addiction, the class action claimed.\nA Missouri man in October brought a similar case against Stake, Drake and Ross, which Ross at the time dismissed as “bullshit”.\nStake.us faces lawsuits in other US states claiming it has operated illegally. Responding to an August case brought by the Los Angeles city attorney, Stake’s Australian parent company, Easygo, told The Australian: “We reject allegations that have been made in the media in relation to this potential claim and will vigorously defend this and all such claims.”\nSince 2022, Drake has promoted Stake on Instagram and on Kick, the Easygo-owned livestreaming platform, including a post in June revealing he had gambled $124.5m and lost $8.2m in a month.\n“Gotta share the other side of gambling… Losses are so fried right now,” he captioned the story post.\n“I hope I can post a big win for you all soon.”\nThe rapper in December promoted hours-long livestreams on Kick with a post captioned: “Can we end my roughest gambling year on a good note?? I want to MAXWIN and share 10% of it with you. Go to Stake to find out how you can enter to win that pot.”\nThe lawsuit alleges Stake has paid Drake $100m a year and provided free gambling credit to the rapper and Ross.\nRoss, a 25-year-old internet personality and professional livestreamer, moved to a rival e-casino, Rainbet, and quit Stake in 2025, telling viewers he would continue streaming on Kick due to his friendship with its 30-year-old founder Ed Craven.\nCraven, hailed by Forbes as Australia’s youngest billionaire with an estimated $2.8bn fortune (A$4.2bn), co-founded Kick in Melbourne in 2022 with Bijan Tehrani after their success with Stake.

Because Australians deserve no less.”\nLey said the opposition was prepared to support a crackdown on hate speech laws but was yet to be briefed on the details of the legislation.\nThe treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said while the calls for a royal commission “come overwhelmingly from a good place” they would not shift the government’s position.\nChalmers reiterated the focus was on “urgent and immediate” steps, which included the new hate speech and gun laws, Dennis Richardson’s review of intelligence and security agencies, responding to Jillian Segal’s antisemitism review and assisting the looming state-based royal commission in NSW.\n“The government is taking a number of steps. We know that the world is watching, because what happened at Bondi last month was such a horrifying event, and the urgent and the immediate actions that we are taking are really important when it comes to us learning from and responding to this attack,” he said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/jan/05/parliament-recalled-early-labor-crack-down-hate-preachers-gun-buybacks-ntwnfb", "published_at": "2026-01-05T06:28:19+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

On Sunday, health departments in New South Wales and South Australia issued alerts after the national “Boxing Day cluster” grew to seven, believed to have been caused by a single traveller who was infectious while moving through several high-traffic public areas.\nIn South Australia, an adult who caught the virus abroad visited Westfield Marion and Event Cinemas on Boxing Day, followed by a visit to Cockles Cafe in Port Elliot on 28 December. The trail continued the following day when that person flew from Adelaide to Sydney on Qantas flight QF748, prompting health authorities in both states to trace fellow passengers and airport visitors.\nNSW has now confirmed three cases within the last week, all involving travellers returning from south-east Asia. Beyond the recent flight, alerts are active for various locations across northern Sydney, as well as the Concord hospital’s emergency department on 3 January between 1pm and 4.10pm.\nThe Sydney locations are the Macquarie Centre on 27 December between 11.30am and 2.30pm, Waitara Family Medical Practice on 29 December from 9am to 10.30am, the food court and Kmart at Westfield Hornsby on 30 December between 12.30pm and 3pm, and the emergency department at Hornsby Ku-ring-gai hospital on 31 December between 5.15pm and 8pm.\nThe Boxing Day cluster has also reached Western Australia, where two cases – including one child – have been confirmed. Victoria has reported a separate case involving an adult who returned from Bali.\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\nWhile the holiday cluster has prompted multi-state alerts, the rise began weeks earlier. Western Australia saw a steady rise in infections throughout December, reaching 60 cases for the year by late last month. Similarly, Queensland authorities issued warnings in mid-December after an infectious traveller arrived on the Gold Coast from Bali.\nProf Peter Collignon, a microbiologist at the Australian National University and former World Health Organization adviser, said there was no immediate threat of a national measles epidemic. He said that while Australia’s vaccination rates were declining, they remained significantly higher than many other countries, including OECD nations.\n“But if fewer people are immunised now, it means the virus can spread more readily than it did 10 years ago,” he said.\nData showing the rate of immunised two-year-olds dipping below the 90% mark was particularly concerning, he said.\nInternational travel was the primary driver for the current cluster of infections in Australia, he said.\n“The biggest factor is that we are traveling more, and travelling to places with low vaccination rates,” he said.\nBefore the introduction of the first vaccine in the 1960s, measles was an almost universal childhood experience in Australia. Although it was seen as a common illness, approximately one in every 10,000 cases proved fatal.\nCollignon said the virus remained exceptionally virulent although it was rarer today.\n“A single infected individual can easily transmit the virus to 20 other people in an unvaccinated setting,” he said.\nBecause measles is airborne and can linger in a room for up to 30 minutes after an infectious person has left, authorities are urging all Australians to verify their vaccination status. Anyone born in or after 1966 who has not had two doses of the MMR vaccine is eligible for a free booster. Typical symptoms include a fever, cough, and runny nose, followed several days later by a distinctive red rash.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/jan/05/measles-alert-infections-australia", "published_at": "2026-01-05T06:21:38+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Trump said she did not have support or respect in Venezuela, but European leaders have embraced her as leading an opposition that deserves power.\nInternational lawyers say the US rejection of Maduro’s legitimacy opens a path for Washington to argue that he does not enjoy sovereign immunity as a head of state in the US domestic courts, in the same way that George Bush was allowed to try Manuel Noriega in the US after his capture in 1989.\nUS officials have claimed the operation against Venezuela was justified on the grounds of self-defence, arguing that the government was involved in drug-trafficking.\nThe Yale professor of international law Oona Hathaway, however, said she saw no plausible justification under the UN charter for the US use of force. “If drug trafficking is a reasonable justification for attacking another country then a whole range of possible arguments can be made that basically mean that self-defence is no longer a real exception. It’s the new rule.”\nIn a sign of Europe’s discomfort, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the prime minister of Greece, one of the 10 non-permanent countries on the UN security council, tried to close down discussion of Trump’s methods. “Nicolás Maduro presided over a brutal and repressive dictatorship that brought about unimaginable suffering on the Venezuelan people. The end of his regime offers new hope for the country,” he wrote on social media, adding that “this is not the time to comment on the legality of the recent actions”.\nThe closer ideological allies of Trump in Europe, such as the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, deemed the US operation legitimate, describing it as a “defensive intervention”.\nCriticism from others was possibly muffled for fear of attracting Trump’s displeasure when his support for Ukraine is still considered vital. The EU foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “The EU has repeatedly stated that Maduro lacks legitimacy, and has defended a peaceful transition. Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN charter must be respected. We call for restraint.”\nThe European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, also focused on what might happen next. “We stand in solidarity with the Venezuelan people and support a peaceful and democratic transition. Any solution must respect international law and the Charter of the United Nations,” she said.\nThe German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, also dived for cover. “The legal assessment of the US intervention is complex and requires careful consideration,” he said.\nFrance too was circumspect. Without mentioning the US military operation, Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that the end of the “Maduro dictatorship” was something the Venezuelan people could “only rejoice in”, and called for a “peaceful and democratic transition” led by Edmundo González Urrutia, the opposition candidate for the 2024 presidential election. In an act of solidarity he also spoke to Machado.\nThe clearest critic was the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, who said the operation to capture Maduro “violates the principle of non-use of force that underpins international law”.\n“France reiterates that no lasting political solution can be imposed from the outside and that sovereign peoples alone decide their future,” he said.\n“The repeated violations of this principle by nations entrusted with the primary responsibility as permanent members of the United Nations security council will have heavy consequences for world security, sparing no one.”\nUK prime minister Keir Starmer shed no tears over Maduro’s departure and mentioned the importance of international law, but the UK prime minister did not discuss how it might apply in this instance.\nThose who advocate for international law may now find themselves appealing to a vanishing world order in which Venezuela is the latest burial in an already crowded graveyard.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/jan/05/europe-greenland-denmark-eu-venezuela-trump-latest-news-updates", "published_at": "2026-01-05T09:00:59+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The US has no right to annex any of the three countries in the Danish kingdom.”\nThe US bombardment of Venezuela and the capture of its president, Nicolás Maduro, has renewed fears of an American takeover of Greenland, as members of Trump’s Maga movement gleefully set their sights on the Danish territory after the attack in South America.\nSpeaking aboard Air Force One on Sunday hours after Frederiksen’s remarks, Trump doubled down on his claim that Greenland should become part of the United States.\n“We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it,” Trump told reporters said when asked about the issue.\nHours after the US military operation in Venezuela, the rightwing podcaster Katie Miller – the wife of Stephen Miller, Donald Trump’s powerful deputy chief of staff for policy – posted on X a map of Greenland draped in the stars and stripes with the caption: “SOON.”\nMiller’s threat to annex the mineral-rich territory, which is part of the Nato alliance, drew outrage from Denmark and Greenland.\nGreenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, called the post “disrespectful”. “Relations between nations and peoples are built on mutual respect and international law – not on symbolic gestures that disregard our status and our rights,” he wrote on X.\nBut he also said: “There is neither reason for panic nor for concern. Our country is not for sale, and our future is not decided by social media posts.”\nCopenhagen’s ambassador to the US, Jesper Møller Sørensen, reposted Miller’s provocation with a “friendly reminder” of the longstanding defence ties between the two countries.\n“We are close allies and should continue to work together as such. US security is also Greenland’s and Denmark’s security,” he said. “The Kingdom of Denmark and the United States work together to ensure security in the Arctic.”\nHe said Denmark had increased defence spending in 2025, committing $13.7bn (£10.2bn) “that can be used in the Arctic and North Atlantic. Because we take our joint security seriously.”\nHe added: “And yes, we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.”\nTrump recently named Jeff Landry, the governor of Louisiana, as a special envoy to Greenland. Landry, a former state attorney general, thanked Trump for his appointment in December, saying it was “an honour to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the US”.\nOn Saturday, Landry welcomed Trump’s toppling of Maduro by force. “Having served as a sheriff’s deputy and AG, I have seen the devastating effects of illegal drugs on American families. With over 100k opioid-related deaths annually, I am grateful to see a President finally take real action in the war on drugs,” he posted on X.\n“Thank you @realDonaldTrump for holding individuals like Maduro accountable.”\nSince taking office a year ago, Trump has rattled European allies with his stated designs on Greenland, which is seen as strategically important for defence and as a future source of mineral wealth. It is home to the US’s most northerly military base, at Pituffik, which Trump’s vice-president, JD Vance, visited in March.\nThe US president has refused to rule out military action to gain control of the territory at a time when the US, China and Russia are jockeying for power in the Arctic, a prospect that has triggered widespread condemnation and disquiet on the island itself.\n“I don’t rule it out. I don’t say I’m going to do it but I don’t rule out anything. No, not there. We need Greenland very badly,” Trump told the US broadcaster NBC in May when asked about a potential takeover by force.\n“Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we’ll take care of, and we’ll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.”\nIn response to a constant drumbeat of threats against the territory, the Danish defence intelligence service last month labelled the US a security risk in a dramatic change in transatlantic relations.\nThe prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland, Mette Frederiksen and Nielsen, said at the time: “We have said it very clearly before. Now we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law … You cannot annex other countries.”\nThe vast majority of Greenland’s 57,000 inhabitants want to become independent from Denmark but have no wish to become part of the US, according to a poll in January. The territory has had the right to declare independence since 2009.\nJennifer Kavanagh, the director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, a thinktank that advocates restraint in US foreign policy, said she had long dismissed Trump’s sabre-rattling toward Greenland.\n“Now I’m not so sure,” she said. “It wouldn’t be that hard for the US to put a couple hundred or a couple thousand troops inside of Greenland, and it’s not clear to me who could do anything about it.”\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this report.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/04/greenland-denmark-us-venezuela-nicolas-maduro-donald-trump", "published_at": "2026-01-04T22:03:10+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

She was initially reported as missing.\nHer family said in a social media post on Sunday: “It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister Charlotte.”\nThe post said her funeral is expected to take place in Paris later this week.\nAccording to the Crans-Montana resort website, Charlotte had been working as a babysitter in the area.\nThe last 16 victims included two Swiss girls aged 15, a Swiss woman aged 22, a Swiss and French woman aged 24, two Italian girls aged 16 and 15, an Italian boy aged 16, a 22-year-old Portuguese woman, a 17-year-old Belgian girl, two French women aged 33 and 26, two French men aged 23 and 20, two French teenage boys aged 17 and 14, and a 15-year-old girl with French, British, and Israeli nationalities, police said.\nThose previously identified were 10 Swiss nationals, two Italians, one person with Italian-Emirati citizenship, one Romanian, one person from France and one from Turkey, Valais police said.\nThe mother of Arthur Brodard, a 16-year-old Swiss boy, confirmed that he was among those killed. “Our Arthur has departed to party in heaven,” Laetitia Brodard-Sitre said on her Facebook page. “Now we can start our mourning, knowing he is in peace.”\nHundreds of people joined a silent procession through the upmarket resort town on Sunday to honour the victims of the catastrophe.\nAfter a service at the Chapelle St-Christophe, the sombre crowd filed silently out of the chapel to organ music. Some exchanged hugs and others applauded before joining the silent march up the hill to Le Constellation bar.\nPeople in the dense procession walked in bright sunshine past shuttered stores. A stream of mourners and well-wishers deposited bouquets at a makeshift memorial piled with flowers, cuddly toys and other tributes.\nApplause began rippling from one end to the other as dozens of police and emergency services workers came up through the middle of the procession to be celebrated as heroes.\n“Through this tragic event, I believe we must all remember that we are all brothers and sisters in humanity,” said Véronique Barras, a local resident who knows grieving families. “It’s important to support each other, to hug each other and to move forward towards light.”\nIn the crowd, Paola Ponti Greppi, an 80-year-old Italian who has a home in Crans-Montana, called for better safety checks in bars. “We need more safety in these places because it’s not the only place like this. Why didn’t the town do the proper checks? For me that’s terrible,” she said.\nDuring the hour-long mass, the bishop Jean-Marie Lovey said condolences had poured in from around the world, including from the pope.\n“Countless people join us – people whose hearts are broken,” Lovey told the congregation. “Many expressions of sympathy and solidarity reach us.\n“Pope Leo XIV joins in our sorrow. In a moving message, he expresses his compassion and his care for the victims’ families and strengthens the courage of all who are suffering.”\nThe Rev Gilles Cavin spoke of the “terrible uncertainty” for families unsure if their loved ones were among the dead or still alive among the injured.\n“There are no words strong enough to express the dismay, anguish and anger of those who are affected in their lives today. And yet we are here, gathered, because silence alone is not enough,” he said.\nSwitzerland will hold a national day of mourning on Friday, with church bells ringing across the country and a minute’s silence planned.\n“In this moment of reflection, everyone in Switzerland can personally remember the victims of the disaster,” the Swiss president, Guy Parmelin, told the Sonntagsblick newspaper.\nInvestigators believe the fire started when sparkling candles were held too close to the ceiling of the venue’s basement level, the region’s chief prosecutor has said.\nTwo people who ran the bar are under criminal investigation on suspicion of offences including homicide by negligence, involuntary bodily harm and involuntarily causing a fire, prosecutors said on Saturday. The announcement did not name the managers.\nAuthorities planned to look into whether sound-dampening material on the ceiling conformed with regulations and whether the candles were permitted for use in the bar. Officials said they also would look at safety measures on the premises, including fire extinguishers and escape routes.\nThere were 119 people injured, including many with disfiguring wounds, and several were transferred to burns units in hospitals across Europe to assist Switzerland’s overwhelmed clinics.\nAuthorities said the severity of the victims’ burns had required the use of DNA samples and dental records to help identify the bodies.\nThe Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/04/crans-montana-fire-victims-identified-silent-procession", "published_at": "2026-01-04T20:08:53+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The tech corporations are in the hands of men with power which we give them,” the group said. “One day we will simply sit before bright screens or dead machines while dying ourselves of thirst and hunger.”\nThe group said it wished to apologise to the less well-off who had been affected by the power cut, but said its sympathy was limited “for the many villa owners” now in the dark.\nThe area affected by the power cut includes many elderly care homes and hospitals as well as high-rise buildings with residents who are reliant on elevators that are now out of order. Berlin received moderate snowfall at the weekend and night-time temperatures plunged well below freezing.\nBerlin’s mayor, Kai Wegner, said he was convinced the mass blackout had a political motive, while security experts said it bore the hallmarks of previous far-left attacks.\n“It is unacceptable that leftwing extremists are once again openly attacking our electricity grid and thereby endangering human lives,” Wegner told reporters during a visit to an emergency shelter for those without heat and hot water.\nWith mobile networks down, police used loudspeakers attached to their vehicles to inform the public as they assisted people in need of care. Several regional commuter lines were interrupted and many pupils who were to return to school on Monday may see their holiday extended well into the week.\nA previous arson attack attributed to the far left in September knocked out electricity for 60 hours in the south-east of the city in what was reportedly Berlin’s longest power cut since the second world war.\nPreliminary theories for the weekend power outage had included possible Russian sabotage, as Germany has been on high alert for attacks on its infrastructure from foreign actors.\nIn March 2024, Vulkangruppe claimed an arson attack against a pylon at the Tesla gigafactory outside Berlin that cut off electricity to the plant and temporarily halted production.\nIn its 2024 annual security report, Germany’s domestic intelligence watchdog cited repeated attacks on the regional power grid by Vulkangruppe, which it classes as a leftwing extremist organisation.\nIt said the group, believed to be about 14 years old, chose targets for their “palpable effects on the population”, intending to cause destruction requiring painstaking and lengthy repairs with little concern for collateral damage.\nStromnetz Berlin said that initially 45,000 households and 2,200 businesses in the districts of Nikolassee, Zehlendorf, Wannsee and Lichterfelde had been affected by the power cut that began at about 6am on Saturday.\nBy midday on Sunday, the company said on its crisis page on its website that about 10,000 households and 300 businesses in Lichterfelde had had their electricity restored.\nBut cold weather was hindering efforts to lay new underground cables, meaning the remaining households may have to wait until Thursday afternoon to get their light and heat back on.\n“Our teams are on the ground and we are working flat out to restore supplies,” Stromnetz Berlin said.\nExperts said attacks on energy infrastructure required little specialist knowledge to have a dramatic impact, with maps featuring key components of the power grid widely available online and few contingency plans ready to be enacted in case of sabotage.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/04/leftwing-militants-responsibility-arson-attack-berlin-power-grid", "published_at": "2026-01-04T16:34:52+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Negotiations over the new food and drink (SPS) agreement announced in May, as well as a youth mobility programme, are continuing but with several significant points of dispute.\nAny further alignment with the EU is likely to come with a further Brussels demand for relaxation of migration restrictions. Starmer said there would be no return to full freedom of movement rights as part of any future negotiations, but defended the deal for a youth mobility scheme.\n“We are looking at a youth mobility scheme which will be for young people to travel, to work, to enjoy themselves in different European countries, to have that experience.”\nThe shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, called the remarks a “Brexit betrayal” and said Starmer was “surrendering our freedom to cut regulation and strike our own trade deals”.\nThe leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, said Starmer’s comments were “a breach of good faith with Labour voters” and criticised the co-operation with the EU on energy markets that is being explored, saying it would tie the UK to “crazy EU net zero policies and carbon taxes”.\nThe battle over closer ties with Europe is likely to be a key dividing line that Labour seeks to draw with Reform. A Labour source said: “Nigel Farage’s biggest weakness is his militant opposition to any relationship with Europe. Couple that with anything to do with clean energy and you can see how he has wound himself up today.\n“But it comes from something much more sinister, too. He doesn’t want British businesses to find things easier. He doesn’t want bills to come down. If Britain struggles, that fuels his politics of division.”\nStarmer has given hints in recent months he would like to revisit strengthening ties with the EU. In November, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister in charge of EU negotiations, was promoted to full cabinet rank.\nMinouche Shafik, the prime minister’s economic adviser, is among those close to Starmer who have suggested internally that returning to the customs union could be one of the most effective ways of generating growth.\nBut Starmer himself has been more reticent, having signed numerous international trade deals while in office including with India and an economic agreement with the US, which he has been able to tout as some of his successes.\nBackbench pressure has been growing within the Labour party, with 13 of its MPs backing a Liberal Democrat proposal to join a customs union in a Commons vote last month.\nThe intervention from Streeting in an Observer interview late last year that a customs union would bring “enormous economic benefits” was widely seen as a challenge to Starmer amid speculation over the prime minister’s future.\nIn his interview with the BBC, Starmer warned his internal rivals they would be opening the door to a government led by Nigel Farage if they recreated the “chaos” of the Tory leadership battles.\n“What I don’t think will help us is if a Labour government turns back to the chaos of the last Tory government. That would gift Nigel Farage,” he said.\nHe said he believed Labour could still win the next election – and said he would be judged at that moment: “I was elected on a five-year mandate to change this country. I intend to deliver on that mandate. I will be judged at the next general election on whether we have brought about the change that people voted for.”\nStarmer said the next election would be “unlike any election we’ve seen in this country for a very, very long time”.\n“Because my strong view is it’ll be a Labour government up against a very rightwing proposition in Reform,” he said. “And that Reform proposition will be a proposition of toxic divide of this country. The next election is going to be about a question of, what is it to be British? And I believe to be British is to be compassionate, reasonable, live and let live, and diverse.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/jan/04/starmer-says-closer-ties-eu-single-market-preferable-customs-union", "published_at": "2026-01-04T16:05:09+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

It said the second staff member’s allegations were investigated and not upheld.\nSmith will face a reelection battle in May if he puts his name forward as general secretary again. He is believed to be facing at least one challenger after expressions of interest were invited in the weeks before Christmas.\nThe continued turbulence at GMB comes after years of trying to address allegations of misogyny, which led to the Karon Monaghan KC report. The Guardian understands that a follow-up of that report, conducted by Monaghan, found in late August this year that only 11 out of about 27 recommendations have been graded as fully implemented five years on, and that it still has more work to do to change its culture.\nA leaked summary of the report, seen by the Guardian, said that while improvements have been made there are still real challenges at the GMB.\nSome female staff at the GMB told the Guardian they felt the culture at the union was as bad as ever, but others said they were fed up with the union being painted as a difficult place to work for women when it gave great opportunities and had changed in the wake of the Monaghan report with measures such as new anti sexual harassment policies.\nIn a statement, the GMB said the first staff member was “dismissed from our employment due to a breakdown in trust and confidence, including matters arising from serious grievance relating to racism, with the complaints made against her by numerous members of staff being fully upheld”.\n“Following legal action at the high court, nearly 700 files were returned to GMB by [her]. [She] had held this data in breach of contract and, despite numerous requests to return it, only did so when legal action was commenced. The GMB data returned related to numerous individuals, including multiple junior members of staff who bravely raised concerns about her conduct during employment with the union.”\nIt said all her complaints “have been properly dealt with, fully investigated and none upheld” and that “GMB has a zero tolerance for any form of discrimination, including racism, and we have acted swiftly in all matters where it is raised”.\nA Unite representative for the first staff member said: “The response from the GMB union is one we challenge robustly. Our member was dismissed with no investigation and no hearing. An investigation and hearing, as set out in Acas guidance, is the minimum we would expect from any employer. The allegations have been denied throughout and are now the subject of an employment tribunal claim.”\nOn the second staff member, the GMB said: “GMB does not comment on matters relating to individual employees and has a duty to ensure staff wellbeing and confidentiality. We can confirm that whistleblowing complaints raised by a senior member of staff were investigated thoroughly over a three-month period in line with GMB’s policies and procedures.\n“The investigation concluded that the allegations were not substantiated and found no evidence of wrongdoing. GMB takes all complaints seriously and remains committed to robust governance and fair process.”\nIn relation to the Monaghan report, the GMB said it had established working groups to complete any remaining tasks. John Smith, chair of the GMB national negotiating committee (NNC), said: “Staff representatives are pleased to be working together with GMB leadership on ensuring the completion of recommendations from the Monaghan report. We anticipate this work to be finished in the near future.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/jan/05/gmb-union-in-fresh-turmoil-over-claims-by-senior-female-leaders", "published_at": "2026-01-05T06:00:28+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The banned products are high in fat, sugar and salt.\nAnna Taylor, the executive director of the Food Foundation campaign group, said: “Today marks a big, world leading milestone on the journey to protect children from being exposed to the onslaught of junk food advertising which is currently so harmful to their health.”\nAlthough the rules come into force today, the UK advertising industry has voluntarily been adhering to them since October to to make sure ads are correctly shorn of products that breach the government’s complex regulations.\nThis made for the first-ever low-fat, low-sugar and low-salt Christmas TV ad campaigns, as products such as puddings and sweet treats were replaced by fruit and vegetables.\nUnder the rules, adverts for items often perceived as healthy are restricted, such as “sandwiches of any kind”, pretzels and “all products predominantly found in the breakfast cereal aisle”, which includes porridge oats and muesli.\nThere is an extensive list of often incongruous exceptions and caveats. However, some products that have been reformulated to meet the junk food nutrient rules are still banned as they are perceived to contribute to the obesity issue, such as certain ranges of crisps, chips and pizza.\nLast year, health campaigners were outraged when the government decided to allow companies that make junk food, such as McDonald’s or Cadbury, to run brand ads as long as they did not show an “identifiable” product.\nThis decision followed a threat of legal action by the food industry against the proposed blanket ban. Allowing brand ads means that Cadbury could run its drumming gorilla ad, for example, before the watershed so long as there were no images of chocolate bars.\n“Legislation permits companies to switch from product advertising to brand advertising, which is likely to significantly weaken [the] impact [of the new rules],” said Taylor. “We can’t stop here, we must remain focused on the goal: banning all forms of junk food advertising to children.”\nLast month, the Food Foundation released its annual report, which found that food companies had been shifting their ad spend into other media before the TV and online ban.\nFood companies’ spend on outdoor media such as billboards and poster sites – which are subject to junk food ad bans only if they are located within 100 metres of premises such as schools or leisure centres – rose 28% between 2021 and 2024.\nThe report found that McDonald’s had increased its outdoor advertising spend by the biggest percentage across the three-year period.\nThe rules have been in the pipeline since 2020, when Boris Johnson’s government announced an advertising ban, saying it would come into force in 2023.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2026/jan/05/ban-tv-junk-food-advertising-9pm-online-obesity", "published_at": "2026-01-05T05:00:26+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Policymakers will need to redouble efforts to address this problem.”\nUnemployment in the UK has reached the highest level outside the Covid pandemic in a decade, with the headline rate hitting 5.1% in October as employers held back on hiring before Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget.\nBusiness leaders have said tax increases and a rising living wage are among contributing factors deterring employers from taking on staff.\nExperts have warned for several years that Britain has been held back by so-called “zombie firms” – companies which barely make enough money to cover their costs but just about stay in business – preventing the allocation of resources to more productive sectors of the economy.\nEconomists have suggested that low interest rates in the years since the 2008 financial crisis contributed to this, as cheap borrowing costs helped debt-laden companies to stay afloat.\nBusinesses have come under pressure from 14 consecutive Bank of England rate between December 2021 and August 2023, designed to tackle inflation. While the Bank has since cut the base rate six times – from a peak of 5.25% to 3.75% – firms’ operating costs remain higher than before the Covid pandemic.\nIn a sign of the pressure, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned in a separate report that business confidence slumped to the lowest level in three years in the final quarter of 2025.\nIn a survey of more than 4,600 firms carried out between 10 November and 8 December – straddling Reeves’s 26 November budget – the lobby group found that tax was the biggest business concern, followed by inflation.\nFewer than half (46%) of companies said they expected increased turnover over the next 12 months, while nearly a quarter (24%) expected a decrease. Only 19% had increased investment and 27% had scaled back plans.\nDavid Bharier, head of research at the BCC, said: “Our data shows more clouds have gathered over business confidence, and the outlook for SMEs in 2026 is unsettled.”\nThe Resolution Foundation said there were early signs that Britain’s productivity growth was being boosted by “creative destruction”, whereby newer and better firms, products or processes replace older, less-efficient, ones. Adoption of artificial intelligence technologies could also be playing a role, it said.\nHowever, it said the short-term impact from job losses would be “hugely difficult,” and urged the government to focus on supporting living standards.\n“Amidst this change one thing that isn’t changing enough is disposable income growth, which is set to grow at mediocre rates for the rest of the parliament,” Curtice said.\n“We must hope – but more importantly act – to ensure that 2026 is a turning point year for lifting living standards too.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/05/collapse-zombie-companies-uk-rise-unemployment", "published_at": "2026-01-05T00:01:19+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Many of the new arrivals are vulnerable and arrive in the UK traumatised.\nUnder new powers, officers will be entitled to make arrivals remove an outer coat, jacket or gloves at UK ports to search for devices. They will also be able to conduct searches inside someone’s mouth for a hidden sim card or small electronic device.\nHome Office sources have previously told the Guardian that, if deemed clearly necessary and proportionate, children could also be subjected to these searches.\nOfficials say the mobile phone searches will enable them to collect intelligence on asylum seekers’ journeys and to arrest people-smugglers. The powers come after the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act became law in December.\nAlex Norris, the borders minister, said: “We are implementing robust new laws with powerful offences to intercept, disrupt and dismantle these vile gangs faster than ever before and cut off their supply chains.”\nOn Sunday, the prime minister said that the UK will start to see “evidence” of asylum hotel closures in the coming months.\nStarmer told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: “I’ve said to the system, to the relevant departments, I want to see that brought forward as soon as possible, but no longer the end of parliament. Bring it forward.\n“I want us to close hotels. I think over coming months you’ll see evidence of that.”\nThe Guardian has disclosed that the Home Office plans to send the first group of asylum seekers to a military site in East Sussex within weeks.\nA total of 41,472 migrants arrived in the UK in 2025 after crossing the Channel – the second highest annual figure on record.\nThe yearly total was 13% higher than the figure for 2024, when 36,816 migrants made the journey, and 41% higher than 2023’s total of 29,437. It was 9% below the all-time high of 45,774 in 2022.\nOpinion polls put Reform significantly ahead of Labour, with a More in Common poll suggesting the party would win 381 seats.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/jan/04/uk-plans-seize-asylum-seekers-phones-condemned-campaigners", "published_at": "2026-01-04T22:30:18+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

May her memory be a blessing to us all.\n“Charles R.”\nSchloss grew up under the name Eva Geiringer in Vienna with her parents and brother.\nShe later lived at Merwedeplein Square in Amsterdam where she met fellow teenager Anne Frank.\nAs the situation in the Netherlands worsened, Schloss and her family moved from house to house for two years to evade capture but they were eventually betrayed by a Nazi sympathiser, who took them in then gave them away.\nOn her 15th birthday they were arrested, brutally interrogated and, in May 1944, forced on to trains to the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.\nSchloss and her mother were subsequently separated from her father and brother.\nDuring their three-day journey to Auschwitz, her brother Heinz told her that he and their father, Erich, had hidden 30 of his paintings under the floorboards of the attic.\nThe siblings’ story was the subject of an exhibition put together at the Jewish Museum in London in 2017.\nSchloss later moved to England and lived in London for more than 70 years.\nThe Auschwitz survivor got married in 1952 to Zvi Schloss and the couple had three daughters: Jacky, Caroline and Sylvia.\nWhen her mother, Elfriede, married Anne Frank’s father, Otto, in 1953, Schloss became Anne Frank’s stepsister.\nIn 2017, Schloss told the Guardian: “Anne was much more mature and grown-up than me. She attended the Montessori school and was an academic year ahead of me. I went to an ordinary local school.”\nIn 2021, aged 92, Schloss once again became a citizen of Austria, the country of her birth.\nIn their tribute, her family said: “We hope her legacy will continue to inspire through the books, films and resources she leaves behind.\n“We are incredibly proud of all that Eva stood for and accomplished, but right now, we are grieving.”\nDan Green, chief executive of the Anne Frank Trust, described Schloss as “a beacon of hope and resilience”, adding: “Her unwavering commitment to challenging prejudice through Holocaust education has left an indelible mark on countless lives.\n“Her legacy will continue to guide and empower young people to build a world free from hatred and discrimination.\n“We at the Anne Frank Trust mourn her loss deeply and extend our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends during this difficult time.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/04/auschwitz-survivor-eva-schloss-dies-king-charles-leads-tributes", "published_at": "2026-01-04T19:19:48+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

He then returned to acting in the 2000s in films including Sin City, The Wrestler and Iron Man 2.\nLast year Rourke was ejected from Celebrity Big Brother UK due to multiple instances of inappropriate language and behaviour that he later admitted, including remarks about the sexuality of his fellow contestant JoJo Siwa. “I’m ashamed of myself,” he said at the time.\nHis manager later announced he would take legal action against the reality show, claiming the show’s producers “were fully aware of both his public persona and how it aligned with his Hollywood rebel image” but had refused to pay his full agreed fee after his exit.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2026/jan/05/mickey-rourke-launches-fundraiser-to-pay-60000-in-rent-after-threat-of-eviction", "published_at": "2026-01-05T05:12:46+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Hundred had to flee a homeless shelter in San Diego this week because of flooding.\nFarther south in Santa Barbara county, a key highway was reopened on Sunday after it was blocked for most of the weekend near Goleta due to a series of mudslides. A man died after he was swept into a creek during the storm, the sheriff’s office said on Saturday.\nParts of Santa Barbara county received more than 4in of rain over two days, the weather service said on Sunday. The heavy rainfall caused all flights into and out of the Santa Barbara airport to be canceled after several runways flooded.\nRain is also forecasted to continue in the southern part of the state through Tuesday.\n“Millions in Southern California are living through one of the wettest starts to winter on record,” McCarthy wrote.\nAssociated Press contributed reporting", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/04/rain-flooding-california-bay-area", "published_at": "2026-01-04T23:41:30+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Officials have not released a cause of death and police have said they do not suspect foul play.\nJones was the daughter of the Academy award-winning actor and his second wife, Kimberlea Cloughley. The couple were divorced in 1996 and have a son, Austin Jones, 43.\nJones appeared in several films as a child, including Men in Black II alongside her father and The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, which Jones directed, as well as making an appearance in the TV series One Tree Hill.\nCourt records obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle show that a woman identified as Victoria Jones was arrested several times on misdemeanor charges in Napa and Santa Cruz counties last year.\nThey include an arrest in April for obstructing a peace officer, being under the influence of a controlled substance and possession of a narcotic controlled substance, and an arrest the following month for resisting or obstructing a public officer and public intoxication.\nIn June, she was arrested on misdemeanor domestic battery charges and related allegations involving domestic violence or elder abuse, according to the outlet.\nIn 2023, her father successfully petitioned a Marin county judge to place her under a temporary conservatorship, arguing that she was engaging in “life-threatening conduct” and needed drug rehabilitation.\nAt the time of the request, the Chronicle said, Marin county court records showed that Victoria Jones was being involuntarily held at a hospital in Greenbrae for being a danger to herself or others.\nJones needed “the services provided by a drug rehabilitation facility that are not available at a hospital”, the actor’s petition stated. “The proposed conservatee needs to recover and work towards sobriety.

But in a year marked by three category 5 hurricanes, record summer humidity and heat, and deadly fires and floods, the cracks have already begun to show.\nFema, bereft of strong leadership and sinking under low morale and large gaps in its workforce, went into hurricane season without a plan in place. Gutted weather-balloon networks in Alaska failed to adequately warn residents in advance of what would become one of the most destructive storms in state history. It took administration officials more than 72 hours to authorise the deployment of federal search-and-rescue teams after the Guadalupe river in Texas surged into a summer camp and through nearby communities in July, a flood that left more than 135 people dead.\nEven as Trump sought to slash federal funding, the cost of disasters continued to climb.\nIn the first half of 2025 alone, damage from weather and climate disasters across the nation totaled more than $101bn, according to Dr Adam Smith, who tracked the data for Noaa until the federal database that cataloged these costs was discontinued in May. “That cost is by far the most costly first half of any year on record dating back to 1980,” he said. Smith now works as the senior climate impacts scientist for the non-profit Climate Central, where he is continuing to build the database.\n“We are in the perfect storm,” said Monica Medina, who served as the principal deputy administrator of Noaa during the Obama administration. Ever-escalating threats are being met with a crumbling safety net, she added, as mismanagement and cuts in funding corrode an emergency response system already close to the brink.\n“We need to have a whole new attitude about preparedness for the types of weather events we are seeing,” she said. “People will suffer. It is just that simple.\n‘This is what it looks like when things fall apart’\nEmergency management has long been messy. Vaguely defined areas of responsibility for preparation and recovery sprawl across multiple levels of government and a chaotic matrix of non-profits, businesses and individuals.\nInvestments made under Joe Biden took aim at some of these problems and initiated a broader focus on environmental justice and building resilience in vulnerable, disadvantaged communities where it was needed most. Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law injected billions of dollars into climate-resilience projects, including improving threatened waterways, supporting underpaid federal wildland firefighters, and protections against extreme heat.\n“We needed to go a lot further, but we had a good start,” said Shana Udvardy, senior climate resilience policy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\nFema, however, was already facing a catastrophe of its own.\nGrappling with staffing constraints, funding shortfalls and an ever-expanding mission caused by the increasing frequency, severity and cost of extreme weather events, a federal analysis created for Congress recommended more money for the beleaguered agency, and investing in the federal disaster workforce to ensure shorter deployments, more support and better training that would curb widespread burnout.\nTrump went in a decidedly different direction.\n“We want to wean off of Fema, and we want to bring it down to the state level,” the president said at a briefing on hurricane and wildfire preparedness in June, claiming the agency was too expensive and “doesn’t get the job done”. “The Fema thing has not been a very successful experiment,” the president concluded.\nA taskforce created by the president was due to publish recommendations in December that would greatly determine Fema’s fate, but the vote on a draft report was pulled after details revealing the dramatic reductions being considered was leaked to the press.\n“The council report recommendations as reported would gut Fema, leaving states to shoulder the burden of disasters and putting disaster victims at risk of serious harm, especially those with the least resources,” Udvardy said. “Council members should release their original report,” she added, urging more congressional oversight of what’s proposed.\nWith the agency’s future hanging in limbo, capacity was systemically slimmed throughout the year.\nHundreds of millions of dollars in national preparedness funding was cut in 2025, and Fema lost roughly a third of its full-time staff – experienced leaders among them – to firings, retirements and resignations.\nCongressionally appointed advisory councils that provide science-based recommendations were disbanded, and Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security secretary, put Fema on a much tighter rein, requiring personal approval for spending over $100,000 – an amount easily surpassed by often-costly disaster contracts and grants – gumming up the agency’s ability to rapidly respond when disasters struck.\nMore than a dozen Fema workers were investigated and put on forced leave after they signed an open letter to Congress warning of the dangerous outcomes that could come from the administration’s changes.\nNow on its third acting administrator in less than a year – none of whom were approved by Congress or had substantial emergency experience – leadership is frail and staff have reported exceedingly low morale, with confusion about core mission and fears of reprisal for speaking out.\nStates are not yet equipped to pick up the slack. “There are budget cycles, there’s legislation. It could take years to make these changes,” said Bill Turner, the emergency management director at the Connecticut department of emergency services and public protection, who also serves as the resilience committee chair for the National Emergency Management Association, a non-profit professional association for US state and territory directors. “We need time to adjust.”\nThe problem is especially concerning for smaller towns and rural communities. Many don’t even have dedicated emergency management departments.\nLocal work to prepare has also been limited by the administration’s crackdown on climate-resilience policies that interfere with Trump’s energy-extraction priorities. Grant programs, including Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (Bric), Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) and Next Generation Warning System (NGWS) – which support states and communities in completing risk-reduction projects – were also suspended or blocked by the Trump administration.\n“A lot of the states are just trying to figure out what the future looks like,” Turner said.\nBut the problems go beyond Fema. Holes in preparedness have grown even in areas Trump has said he prioritizes, including preventing catastrophic wildfire.\nTrump championed firefighters and called for bolstering preparedness for a year-round fire season, using the devastating Los Angeles wildfires as a call to action. In June, Trump signed an executive order that claimed to strengthen mitigation and improve land management practices. He also oversaw efforts to create a new federal firefighting force, housed in the Department of the Interior, long called for by firefighters and experts.\nBut after slashing thousands of jobs from already understaffed land management agencies, including the US Forest Service, lots of essential work was left undone. Chaos reigned as fire risks began to mount over the summer, and firefighting crews reported being left without power for weeks due to cut maintenance workers, paychecks being late or halved because administrative roles were left empty, or having to mow lawns outside their offices, manage campsites and do plumbing work at their barracks in addition to their other duties.\nHazardous fuels reduction work – which includes prescribed burning, brush clearing and other techniques to cull highly flammable vegetation from high-risk areas – was down roughly 38% in 2025, according to a new analysis by Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an organization made up of current and former federal wildland firefighters.\n“This is what it looks like when things fall apart,” said Udvardy, “and it’s going to take years to build it all back up.”\nA profound impact\nOnce considered a global leader in climate science and weather forecasting, the US has sharply changed direction under Trump, starting with Noaa, the agency tasked with the nation’s weather forecasting and climate monitoring.\nThousands of staff left, including hurricane hunters, researchers, meteorologists and operations staff, and the holes left behind hobbled the agency’s ability to perform essential functions right as severe storms began to brew.\nIn the spring, roughly a quarter of the National Weather Service (NWS) forecast offices were lacking chief meteorologists. Several offices across the US also had to cease overnight monitoring due to staff shortages, and weather balloon launches that collect data for forecasting had to be vastly reduced, undermining accuracy. By September, hundreds of jobs were unfilled after one in seven NWS workers left through resignations, retirements or firings.\nThe NWS was given permission to begin refilling its ranks in late July, reopening 450 of the roughly 550 jobs cut, after policymakers and the public raised grave concerns over impacts on public safety. But progress has been sluggish. In December, only 80 final job offers had been accepted, CNN reported.\nEven if those jobs are restaffed, experts have lamented the enormous amount of experience lost – roughly 27,000 years of collective experience tallied from Noaa job losses alone.\nThe White House canceled the contracts that produced legally mandated national climate assessments, websites that were relied on by local governments, states, businesses and residents to prepare for climate events, and pulled climate.gov, a widely used portal chock-full of resources, from public view.\nNine Noaa stations tracking tsunami-causing earthquakes went offline at the end of November, after the administration pulled funding from a lab that’s spent decades monitoring seismic activity; satellite instruments that track carbon dioxide levels and provide intel on water and air pollution are also on the chopping block.\nWhile these losses are expected to have a profound impact on the American public, they will be felt globally, too. Scientists and forecasters around the world depend on US satellites, studies and intelligence, including data-sharing that tracks severe weather across Europe, coordination of disaster response in the Caribbean, and the monitoring of deforestation and the effects of the climate crisis in the Amazon rainforest.\n“This is an essential part of the social safety net we depend on the government to provide – that is why we pay taxes – and this administration is dismantling it,” Medina said, pointing to US research that she said has long provided a public good at extremely low cost. The gaps in data and research and the loss of scientists from the federal workforce will be challenging to build back, even if the government changes course.\n“You can’t just buy the data you never collected,” she added. Even corporations hoping to meet the demand rely on federal forecasts and infrastructure. “The private sector sits on top of a foundation of government science that is falling apart,” she said.\nNo longer relying on the federal government\nThe disasters of today are already packing a punch. But during the next decade, Earth is expected to blow past the critical 1.5C threshold, officials with the United Nations Environment Programme said in November, and extreme events will get exponentially worse.\n“Each year above 1.5 degrees will hammer economies, deepen inequalities and inflict irreversible damage,” the UN secretary general António Guterres said in November in Belém, Brazil, speaking at the global Cop climate summit, where a US delegation was notably absent for the first time.\nTrump has repeatedly sown doubt in the climate crisis and in policies to protect against it, and has consistently worked to undermine scientific warnings, shifts to renewables by other governments, domestic and international, and rolled back regulations in the US. In 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency made cuts to climate and resilience programs, limited clean air and water investigations and enforcement, and moved to rescind the endangerment finding under the Clean Air Act, which links greenhouse gas emissions to poor public health outcomes.\nFacing a future with less federal support as extremes intensify, emergency managers have encouraged the public to stay vigilant.\n“Everyone has a role in preparedness,” Turner said. “We’re not going to let the noise change the core of what we do every day.”\nBut big gaps remain – and they might grow.\n“We are trying to break down that misconception that after a major disaster, the state or federal government will be able to come in and make you whole,” he said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/04/donald-trump-disaster-response-preparedness", "published_at": "2026-01-04T17:00:11+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

That’s for the Americans to speak to.”\nOn Saturday, Starmer said he wanted to speak to Trump directly before making any judgment on the US’s actions. “I don’t shy away from this. I’ve been a lifelong advocate of international law and the importance of compliance with international law,” he told the BBC.\n“But I want to ensure that I’ve got all the facts at my disposal, and we haven’t got that at the moment, and we need to get that before we come to a decision about the consequences in relation to the actions that have been taken.”\nStarmer is likely to face an urgent question in the Commons when it returns on Monday. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, criticised Starmer’s hesitancy on Sunday, saying it would give Trump licence for hostile acts against other sovereign countries.\n“First Venezuela, next Greenland?” he posted on X in response to a post from the wife of Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, that showed the American flag superimposed on Greenland with the word “SOON”.\n“You don’t suck up to bullies like Trump, he will just see it as a sign of weakness. Keir Starmer needs to get on the phone to our European allies including the Danish PM, and show a united front against Trump’s threats.”\nGreenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, called Katie Miller’s post “disrespectful”, while Denmark’s ambassador to the US, Jesper Møller Sørensen, said “we expect full respect for the territorial integrity” of Denmark.\nPhilippe Sands KC, a human rights lawyer who has known Starmer for several decades, said it was clear the action was “manifestly illegal under international law, and cannot plausibly or by any reasonable standard be characterised as a law enforcement action”.\nSands said Starmer’s failure to condemn the action “speaks volumes”. “Having lived through the catastrophe and criminality of the Iraq war in 2003, which Mr Trump himself has condemned, I would hope that Keir Starmer sticks to the principles of legality to which he says he is so firmly committed,” he said.\nThe deputy leader of Reform UK defended Trump’s actions and said it was not comparable to Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine and attempt to capture Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nRichard Tice said: “It’s clearly in accordance with US domestic law. Lawyers will argue, of course, about UN article 51. The reality is that an enemy of the west has been removed. The challenge now … is to ensure that you don’t end up with a vacuum that slides into what happened in Iraq and Libya; that’s the key challenge.”\nHe said the comparisons with Russia “are chalk and cheese; there is no comparison whatsoever”, and “Putin has never said he was going to give Ukraine back to the Ukrainians … He wanted to invade the whole of Ukraine and to keep it.”\nTice added: “The US constitution gives the right to the commander-in-chief, the US president, to act in the self-defence of US citizens.”\nThe shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, said it was clear that Maduro did not have a mandate to remain in power and that there were “political questions about what that pathway to democracy is going to be for Venezuela”.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/jan/04/uk-unclear-us-attack-venezuela", "published_at": "2026-01-04T17:36:17+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

It’s even more than just groups and individuals on the far right being used as proxies. They are literally a vehicle for attacking the ideas that underpin our democracy.”\nRussian “influence operations” in Britain have been ratcheted up in recent years, in addition to espionage operations ranging from arson to spy rings.\nHowever, there have also been worries about more subtle attempts to sow societal divisions. The Guardian revealed earlier this year how a network of Telegram channels with Russian links was encouraging UK residents to commit violent attacks on mosques and Muslims and offering cryptocurrency in return.\nThere have been calls for a ban on Patriotic Alternative, regarded as the UK’s largest far-right group, albeit one that has faced challenges from newer rivals.\nCollett, once a young acolyte of the then BNP leader Nick Griffin and now a veteran far-right figure, founded the group after splits in the BNP. It quickly became a home for a digital-savvy younger generation of activists.\nHe confirmed to the Guardian that he had attended the Russian event, as an online participant. Collett said that he gave a three-minute speech discussing birthrates and immigration in Britain, how white Britons would be reduced to a minority in future “and that eastern European countries must not allow the same thing on their soil”.\nCollett said he had been invited by the Brotherhood of Academists, a nationalist student movement operating in universities across Russia and in occupied parts of Ukraine.\n“I do not believe that Russia desires war with the west, or with Britain. What’s more, I have never received any contact or payment from anyone within the Russian establishment, so the idea that myself or Patriotic Alternative is being ‘used’ by the Russian state is absurd, and a groundless suggestion,” he told the Guardian. He believed the conflict in Ukraine was “stoked” by the previous US government because it desired a proxy war with Russia.\nThe key figure behind the event, which took place at St Petersburg’s Legislative Assembly building on 12 September, was Konstantin Malofeyev, a banker whose business interests include the Kremlin-supporting Tsargrad media group and who founded the Brotherhood of Academists.\nMalofeyev, who has been described by the US authorities as “one of the main sources of financing” for the promotion of Russian interests in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, hailed the conference in a post on Telegram.\n“More than 50 delegates from 15 rightwing patriotic organisations across three continents came to St Petersburg. Diverse, but united on key issues: a desire to defend Christian values, a fight for national identity and sovereignty, and resistance to our common enemy – globalism,” said Malofeyev, who is known as the “Orthodox oligarch” because of his support for the Russian church.\nHe said that the event opened with a “Christian memorial” and a moment of silence for the rightwing US activist Charlie Kirk, who was killed two days before the forum.\nThe Guardian has previously reported how Malofeyev appears to have been involved in the movement of millions of dollars through the global banking system with the help of a Cypriot financial services firm after he was placed under sanctions by western governments.\nIn addition to Collett, other participants included the French author Alain de Benoist, the Franco-Swiss ideologue Alain Soral and a German politician, Alexander von Bismarck.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/04/leading-uk-far-right-activist-russian-nationalist-event-mark-collett", "published_at": "2026-01-04T10:00:03+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Trump said she did not have support or respect in Venezuela, but European leaders have embraced her as leading an opposition that deserves power.\nInternational lawyers say the US rejection of Maduro’s legitimacy opens a path for Washington to argue that he does not enjoy sovereign immunity as a head of state in the US domestic courts, in the same way that George Bush was allowed to try Manuel Noriega in the US after his capture in 1989.\nUS officials have claimed the operation against Venezuela was justified on the grounds of self-defence, arguing that the government was involved in drug-trafficking.\nThe Yale professor of international law Oona Hathaway, however, said she saw no plausible justification under the UN charter for the US use of force. “If drug trafficking is a reasonable justification for attacking another country then a whole range of possible arguments can be made that basically mean that self-defence is no longer a real exception. It’s the new rule.”\n“The idea that because drugs are coming from a country justifies an invasion and a change of administration in that country gets rid of any kind of limits on the use of force,” she said. The US action was a breach of international law unlike any before, she said.\nIn a sign of Europe’s discomfort, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the prime minister of Greece, one of the 10 non-permanent countries on the UN security council, tried to close down discussion of Trump’s methods. “Nicolás Maduro presided over a brutal and repressive dictatorship that brought about unimaginable suffering on the Venezuelan people. The end of his regime offers new hope for the country,” he wrote on social media, adding that “this is not the time to comment on the legality of the recent actions”.\nThe closer ideological allies of Trump in Europe, such as the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, deemed the US operation legitimate, describing it as a “defensive intervention”.\nCriticism from others was possibly muffled for fear of attracting Trump’s displeasure when his support for Ukraine is still considered vital. The EU foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “The EU has repeatedly stated that Maduro lacks legitimacy, and has defended a peaceful transition. Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN charter must be respected. We call for restraint.”\nThe European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, also focused on what might happen next. “We stand in solidarity with the Venezuelan people and support a peaceful and democratic transition. Any solution must respect international law and the charter of the United Nations,” she said.\nThe German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, also dived for cover. “The legal assessment of the US intervention is complex and requires careful consideration,” he said.\nFrance too was circumspect. Without mentioning the US military operation, Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that the end of the “Maduro dictatorship” was something the Venezuelan people could “only rejoice in”, and called for a “peaceful and democratic transition” led by Edmundo González Urrutia, the opposition candidate for the 2024 presidential election. In an act of solidarity he also spoke to Machado.\nThe clearest critic was the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, who said the operation to capture Maduro “violates the principle of non-use of force that underpins international law”.\n“France reiterates that no lasting political solution can be imposed from the outside and that sovereign peoples alone decide their future,” he said.\n“The repeated violations of this principle by nations entrusted with the primary responsibility as permanent members of the United Nations security council will have heavy consequences for world security, sparing no one.”\nKeir Starmer shed no tears over Maduro’s departure and mentioned the importance of international law, but the UK prime minister did not discuss how it might apply in this instance.\nThose who advocate for international law may now find themselves appealing to a vanishing world order in which Venezuela is the latest burial in an already crowded graveyard.\nTrump’s actions cement a new system in which the naked self-interest of two or three “great powers” dominates. In this world order, Washington and Beijing will decide on the basis that might is right.\nThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, explicitly threatened on Saturday that Cuba was next. “Cuba is a disaster, run by incompetent and senile men,” he said. “If I were them, I would be a little worried.”\nThe advocates of multilateralism and international courts may also need to reflect on their own failures.\nNizar El Fakih , a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said: “Multilateralism did not deliver a single effective negotiation process leading to an orderly, peaceful and negotiated transition, despite years of appeals by millions of Venezuelans who voted, protested and exhausted every available civic mechanism at enormous personal cost.\n“The international criminal court, with an investigation open since 2021, has yet to issue a single indictment, despite extensive documentation of crimes against humanity by the United Nations fact-finding mission on Venezuela, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and hundreds of victims”.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/04/venezuela-european-leaders-divided-and-torn-in-response-to-us-ousting-of-maduro", "published_at": "2026-01-04T16:00:12+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

In an emotional Instagram video posted on Sunday, Nelson revealed the girls had been diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA1).\n“We were told that they’re probably never going to be able to walk; they probably will never regain their neck strength, so they will be disabled, and so the best thing we can do right now is to get them treatment, and then just hope for the best,” she said.\n“Thankfully, the girls have had their treatment, which you know, I’m so grateful for because if they don’t have it, they will die.”\nNelson said the twins had been diagnosed after four months of “gruelling” hospital appointments, and she wanted to raise awareness of the condition and the signs to look out for because “time is of the essence” with the disease.\nSMA1 is the most severe and common form of the genetic neuromuscular disorder and causes muscle weakness, progressive loss of movement and paralysis.\n“I just think that I can raise as much awareness about this as possible, and the signs, then, you know, something good has to come out of this,” said Nelson.\nShe added that the signs to look for were floppiness, an inability to hold themselves up without support, a “frog-like” positioning of the legs without much movement, and rapid breathing in the tummy.\nShe added: “If anyone is watching this video and they think they see these signs in their child, then please, please take your child to the doctor, to the hospital, because time is of the essence, and your child will need treatment. And the quicker you get this, the better their life will be.”\nAccording to the NHS, about 70 children are born with SMA each year in the UK, and without treatment fewer than one in 10 (8%) will survive to the age of two.\nThe website of the charity SMA UK says that “early detection of the condition is critical” for better outcomes for babies, adding that the UK is “shockingly far behind” in not including SMA in the NHS newborn blood-spot screening test, which is offered when a baby is five days old and currently looks for nine rare but serious conditions.\nThree “transformative” new SMA medicines were rolled out on the NHS from 2019, including disease-modifying treatments such as gene therapy. In September last year NHS Scotland added SMA to its newborn screening programme as part of a two-year pilot scheme. Babies treated before symptoms developed could, in many cases, “follow normal developmental pathways”, said NHS Scotland.\nNelson said the diagnosis was made after her mother noticed the twins “were not showing as much movement in their legs as they should be”, and they later began to struggle with feeding. But because the twins were premature the couple had been told their development was likely to be behind that of other babies and when they first went to see the doctor they were told not to worry.\n“The reason I wanted to make this video was because the last few months has honestly been the most heartbreaking time of my life,” said the singer.\n“I literally feel like my whole life has done a 360, I almost feel like I’m grieving a life that I thought I was going to have with my children, and I’ll have to be grateful because at the end of the day, they’re still here, and that’s the main thing, and they’ve had their treatment.\n“And I truly believe that my girls will fight all the odds and, with the right help, they will fight this and go on to do things that have never been done.”\nThe singer has already used social media to speak about complications during her pregnancy, including twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which affects 10% to 15% of identical twins who share a placenta and “can have serious consequences”, according to the NHS. The singer underwent an emergency procedure and spent 10 weeks in hospital before giving birth prematurely at 31 weeks on 15 May.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/04/little-mix-jesy-nelson-twin-babies-may-never-walk", "published_at": "2026-01-04T14:53:52+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

If you’re a whistleblower you’re going to get in trouble in the NHS, if you’ve got coloured skin you’re probably going to get in trouble.”\nPeople of colour who work in the NHS are more likely to face disciplinary action than white staff, and minority ethnic doctors are more likely to fear adverse consequences if they raise patient safety concerns.\nAbdullah was suspended from Charing Cross hospital after signing a petition in support of a colleague after a patient complaint, and then writing a letter for the colleague in which he described the patient as a “professional complainer against NHS staff”.\nAn independent inquiry, which Kapur helped bring about, found in 2018 that Abdullah “should have known that signing the petition was not appropriate” but it noted none of the other 18 signatories had been disciplined and concluded the 41-year-old had been “treated unfairly” by Imperial College healthcare NHS trust.\nKapur, who is a member of Justice for Doctors, is also calling for other staff protections, including extending the maintaining high professional standards framework, intended to ensure fairness in addressing concerns about doctors and dentists, to all healthcare professionals.\nAdditionally, he wants the healthcare regulator, the Care Quality Commission, to be split into two, with one body dealing with patients and the other with staff. Kapur said: “You need to have external scrutiny of trusts and also private healthcare bodies as to how they treat staff, especially whistleblowers and BME [black and minority ethnic] staff.”\nHe is also calling for reduced use by the NHS of the “some other substantial reason” legal mechanism, which enables organisations to fire employees for reasons other than conduct or capability. Between April 2010 and September 2018, the NHS sacked 10,604 members of staff under the SOSR mechanism, commonly justified by a breakdown in relationships.\nKapur said: “If I can do things to make sure that what happened to me and Abdullah won’t happen to people in the future, I will do until there are meaningful improvements.”\nA NHSE spokesperson said it was working with the Department of Health and Social Care to ensure protection for whistleblowers. They added: “It is completely unacceptable for any member of staff to feel silenced or unable to speak up about issues affecting them or their patients. We’d urge anyone who has concerns to contact the Freedom to Speak Up guardian in their organisation, to help ensure the NHS learns from mistakes so we can provide the best possible care for patients.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/04/nhs-england-external-second-opinion-amins-rule", "published_at": "2026-01-04T12:00:06+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The new rates come into effect on Monday.\nThe move follows a reduction in the Bank of England base rate in December to 3.75%. Mortgage brokers said it was good new year news for borrowers as rivals were likely to follow suit.\n“Many of the other big lenders will feel the need to also cut to remain competitive, which could result in a rate war,” David Stirling, an independent financial adviser at Mint Wealth, told the news agency Newspage.\n“HSBC has set the tone for 2026 early. This is a real statement of intent and shows that they are keen to lend en masse this year. Will we see a January rate war as others undoubtedly join the fold?”\nApproximately 1.8 million homeowners are expected to refinance mortgages this year, with many coming off super-low, fixed-rate deals secured before interest rates began rising at the end of 2021.\nLast week the financial data firm Moneyfacts said the average rate on a two-year fixed residential mortgage was running at 4.83%. The average two-year, buy-to-let residential mortgage rate stood at 4.7%.\n“We could potentially see sub-3.5% deals before the spring, with any luck,” Stirling said.\nCity economists expect two more cuts to the base rate this year, despite the Bank of England warning that such judgments will become “a closer call”.\nThe BoE’s monetary policy committee voted five to four in favour of the cut in December, with the governor, Andrew Bailey, switching his vote from hold to cut.\nBorrowers on variable rate deals tied to the base rate will see their repayment fall as a result. The cost of fixed-rate mortgages is based on the outlook for rates and on lenders’ desire to attract customers. Recently the trade body UK Finance predicted that demand for new home loans would fall in 2026, but remortgaging activity was set to rise.\nNicholas Mendes, the mortgage technical manager at the broker John Charcol, said much of the predicted outlook for the base rate was already priced into fixed-rate mortgages.\n“The cheapest two- and five-year fixes remain below bank rate, reflecting expectations of further cuts,” he said. “As a result, fixed mortgage rates are likely to fall by less than bank rate from here, and by the end of 2026 could once again be priced above bank rate as markets judge rates to be close to their long-term floor.”\nLast week Nationwide, the UK’s biggest building society, said house prices unexpectedly fell in December, with the market finishing the year with the weakest annual growth in more than 18 months.\nCity economists had forecast a 0.1% month-on-month rise.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/04/hsbc-first-big-uk-lender-cut-mortgage-rates-2026", "published_at": "2026-01-04T15:54:46+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Electric car sales are still growing rapidly, albeit more slowly than manufacturers had expected.\nHowever, the transition to cleaner vans is lagging behind cars, and the number of diesel vans has continued to rise, to a record 4.4m.\nThe UK went through a “dash for diesel” cars in the 2000s as the government granted them cheaper tax rates. Diesel engines tend to be more efficient than petrol engines, burning less fuel and producing less carbon dioxide.\nHowever, they also produce more nitrous oxides, which are harmful to health. In 2015 Volkswagen was found to have created software to cheat on emissions tests, kicking off the “Dieselgate” scandal, costing it alone €30bn (£26bn) around the world in fines, compensation and legal costs. Analysis this year suggested the extra emissions from cheat devices from Volkswagen and other carmakers were responsible for thousands of deaths and cases of asthma.\nSales of cars with diesel engines duly plummeted, to fewer than 100,000 in the first 11 months of 2025. However, it will take some time for the share of diesel cars on the road to diminish, as many cars bought during the peak years of diesels are only now being scrapped.\nBattery electric cars made up only 4% of the cars on UK roads last year, compared with 32% diesels and 58% that use petrol, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group. The other 6% were hybrids, which mostly combine a smaller battery with a petrol engine.\nNevertheless, the number of diesels should drop as older cars are scrapped, delivering benefits for towns and cities where particulates tend to be concentrated. That will also have a knock-on effect for filling stations, leading to many withdrawing diesel supplies.\nLondon is expected to be the first place in the UK where no diesel cars or vans are registered, largely because of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which applies charges for more polluting non-compliant cars. Diesel numbers are also dropping rapidly in the central belt of Scotland, which contains Edinburgh and Glasgow, both of which have low-emission zones.\n“Ending the use of diesel is essential to clean up Britain’s choking cities,” said Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of New AutoMotive. “The UK is now rolling out electric cars at a rapid pace, and this is great news for everyone that enjoys clean air, quieter streets and really cheap running costs.\n“The UK imports billions of pounds of diesel every year, and we have been completely reliant on other countries to feed our thirst. Thankfully, we’re switching to electric cars at a rapid rate, and that will make the country cleaner and wealthier.”\nHowever, the analysis found that people in cities appeared to be selling their diesels to people in more rural areas.\nThe report found that, while the number of diesel vans has risen over the past decade, the peak of new diesel van sales probably happened before the pandemic, meaning the numbers on roads will eventually fall.\nMatt Finch, an environmental policy expert who co-wrote the report, said the world was “leaving the diesel age”.

Amid questions, including from top Republicans, Trump has now called on Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, to accommodate US demands or face the possibility of a fresh military intervention.\nRodríguez, 56, who had on Saturday pledged fealty to ousted president Nicolás Maduro and condemned his capture as an “atrocity”, appears to be adhering to the US line.\nThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, spoke to Rodríguez, who told him “‘we’ll do whatever you need’”, Trump told reporters. “She, I think, was quite gracious, but she really doesn’t have a choice.”\nHere are the key stories at a glance:\nUS ‘running’ Venezuela now seems less likely but second intervention possible The prospect of the United States seizing direct control of Venezuela appeared to recede on Sunday after the shocking seizure of President Nicolás Maduro – but US officials said Washington was keeping a 15,000-strong force in the Caribbean and might make a fresh military intervention if Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, did not accommodate their demands.\nRead the full story\nDemocrats decry Trump’s military raid on Venezuela Democratic leaders responded with fury on Sunday to Donald Trump ’s military intervention in Venezuela , slamming it as an illegal act carried out in the absence of required congressional approval that would lead to disaster for the American people.\n“They literally lied to our face,” said Chris Murphy, a US senator from Connecticut, on Sunday, referring to a briefing on Venezuela that the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio , gave to his chamber last month. “The message they sent was that this wasn’t about regime change … They said this is just a counter-narcotics operation.”\nRead the full story\nProtests erupt in US cities over Trump’s military intervention in Venezuela Protests bubbled up in several US cities over the weekend as people demonstrated against the Trump administration’s unilateral military intervention in Venezuela – even as many in the diaspora publicly celebrated the forced removal of president Nicolás Maduro .\nRead the full story\nVenezuelans under TPS can apply for refugee status, Kristi Noem says Kristi Noem , the US homeland security secretary, said on Sunday that the US wants a leader in Venezuela who will be “a partner that understands that we’re going to protect America” to stop drug trafficking and “terrorists from coming into our country”.\nRead the full story\nUS ‘has no right’ to take over Greenland, Danish PM says after renewed Trump threats Denmark’s prime minister has urged Donald Trump to stop threatening to take over Greenland after the president said the US “absolutely” needs the territory.\nMette Frederiksen said on Sunday: “It makes absolutely no sense to talk about the US needing to take over Greenland.

She added: “We need to make sure that our programs actually mean something, and that we’re following the law.”\nFour months ago, Noem terminated the 2021 Biden-era designation of TPS for Venezuela, affecting over 250,000 Venezuelans living in the US, after determining it is “contrary to the US national interest”.

The 1973 War Powers Resolution requires presidents to seek approval from Congress for military engagements.\nYet in the case of Saturday’s dawn bombardment on Venezuela and military landing to snatch Maduro, not even the “gang of eight”, the top congressional leaders of both main parties who are traditionally consulted on national security issues, were notified about the operation.\n“Still haven’t got a phone call,” said Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee. He told CNN: “I’m a member of the gang of eight, and I have yet to get a phone call from anyone from the administration.”\nAmid widespread condemnation of Maduro’s dictatorship and defiance of international laws, Democrats nevertheless decried the Trump administration’s unilateral intervention in the South American country.\nHimes lambasted the military operation, which he dubbed an “imperial adventure”, as “another example of absolute lawlessness on the part of this administration”. He accused Trump of “paving the way for disaster” and “not giving a hoot about the US congress”.\nTrump and his inner circle have attempted to justify the bypassing of Congress in the snatching of Maduro by portraying it as a law enforcement and counter-narcotics operation rather than a military strike. Top Democrats said that was dissembling.\nHakeem Jeffries, who leads the Democrats in the House of Representatives, told NBC News’s Meet the Press that the Venezuela action “was an act of war. This was a military action involving Delta Force, involving the army, apparently involving thousands of troops, involving at least 150 military aircraft.” Rubio has denied it was war.\nTrump’s ostracisation of Congress dramatically raises the stakes in next week’s vote in the US Senate on a bipartisan war powers resolution. It seeks to block the administration from launching any further military hostilities against Venezuela without express approval of congress.\nThe debate is privileged, meaning it cannot be halted by the Republican leadership, and needs only a simple majority to pass. It has the backing of Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky who has been a thorn in the president’s side over foreign policy.\nChuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, is another sponsor of the war powers resolution. He told This Week on ABC News that if the measure gains a majority vote in both chambers, “then the president can’t do another thing in Venezuela without the okay of Congress”.\nSchumer painted Saturday’s action, and Trump’s claim that Venezuela would be run by the US for now, in apocalyptic terms. “We have learned through the years, when America tries to do regime change and nation building in this way, the American people pay the price in both blood and in dollars.”\nHe said it amounted to the exact opposite of what Trump had promised in the course of the 2024 presidential election campaign. “The very thing that Donald Trump campaigned against over and over and over again was no more endless wars, and right now we’re headed right into one with no barriers, with no discussion.”\nIn his CNN interview, Murphy picked up on Trump’s remarks on Saturday that the US would temporarily seize control of Venezuela’s oil. He said it pointed to the real motive behind ousting Maduro – the further enrichment of Trump and friends.\n“Venezuela is all about making money for his friends. Wall Street, the oil industry, they can make a lot of money off of Venezuela if they run it,” he said.\n“Once again, you’re seeing that this president’s foreign policy, the invasion of Venezuela, the ouster of Maduro, is about making his crowd filthy rich. It has nothing to do with American national security.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/04/democrats-trump-white-house-venezuela", "published_at": "2026-01-04T18:12:27+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Here are the 31 people who died in custody", "body": "<p>The deaths came as the Trump administration ramped up immigration enforcement, detaining a record number of people</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/04/ice-2025-deaths-timeline\">Continue reading...</a>", "content": "Thirty-one people died in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody in 2025 – making it the agency’s deadliest year in more than two decades, as the Trump administration moved to detain a record number of people.\nSome of those who died in detention had arrived in the US recently, seeking asylum. Others had arrived years ago, some as young children. Some had been apprehended on criminal charges or had served time for convictions; others had been picked up in the administration’s indiscriminate ICE raids.\nThey died of seizure and heart failure, stroke, respiratory failure, tuberculosis or suicide. Some died at ICE detention centers and field offices, others after they had been transferred to hospitals, but were still under ICE custody. In some cases, their families and lawyers have alleged, they died of neglect, after repeatedly trying and failing to get medical care.\nThese deaths occurred as the Trump administration ramped up its immigration operations, detaining a record number of people in December. The agency was holding 68,440 people in detention in mid-December; nearly 75% of them had no criminal convictions. December was also the deadliest month in ICE custody – six people died.\nAs detention facilities across the US grow more crowded, human rights advocates, immigration lawyers and lawmakers have reported unsanitary conditions, inadequate food and poor medical care. The number of deaths this year marks the highest level since 2004.\n“This is a result of the deteriorating conditions inside of ICE detention,” said Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at Detention Watch Network, a non-profit that has been tracking immigration detention deaths for years.\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which encompasses ICE, denied that conditions in detention were declining. “It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody,” said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the agency. She added that the average rate of death remained low, saying that “consistent with data over the last decade, death rates in custody are 0.00007%”, but did not provide the underlying data for that figure.\nAdvocates, however, warned that as the administration detains more people, ICE facilities will continue to see more deaths.\n“I’m definitely worried that in the coming years, we could see more of this as ICE is trying to expand its facilities, detain and deport more people,” said Ghandehari.\nThe Guardian has been tracking everyone who died in custody this year. These are their stories.\n23 January\nGenry Ruiz Guillén, 29, of Honduras, died in a hospital in Hialeah, Florida.\nGuillén had come to the United States from Honduras in 2023. He worked in construction.\nIn October 2024, he was apprehended by local law enforcement, and then transferred to the Krome immigrant detention center in South Florida. His mother told Univision that in December, Guillén called her from detention and told her he wasn’t feeling well, and that he was experiencing fainting spells. It was the last time she spoke with him, she said.\nAccording to ICE, Guillén “had difficulty breathing, prompting a medical emergency” before he died.\n“I never thought my son would come to this country to die like this, nor did I ever think I would receive that news,” his mother told Univision.\n29 January\nSerawit Gezahegn Dejene, 45, of Ethiopia, died at a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona.\nHe had come to the US in August 2024, and was apprehended by the border patrol, which transferred him to the Eloy detention center. He had cleared the initial steps to apply for asylum according to ICE.\nIn December 2024, he reported to staff at the detention center that he had an elevated heart rate and fatigue, and was seen by healthcare providers who said he had a possible lymphoma diagnosis, according to ICE.\n20 February\nMaksym Chernyak, a Ukrainian citizen, died of an apparent stroke at a hospital in Miami.\nChernyak, 44, fled Kyiv with his long term-partner during the Russia-Ukraine war and came to the US on humanitarian parole, according to the Miami Herald.\nChernyak was arrested on 26 January over a domestic violence claim. His partner described the incident as a “family misunderstanding” exacerbated by a language barrier, according to the Miami Herald. He was “kind and warm-hearted”, she told the outlet. Chernyak was then transferred to the Krome detention center in Miami.\nWhile in custody, he experienced “vomiting and seizure activity”, according to ICE. Chernyak was then transferred to a hospital on 18 February, where staff “established a stroke alert due to unresponsive state”, according to ICE. A preliminary cause of death was listed as “bleeding from the brain”.\nAn investigation by the Miami Herald said that medical experts who reviewed his case have raised concerns about whether Chernyak received adequate care due to the length of time that elapsed before Krome staff called 911. ICE denied allegations that Chernyak did not receive proper medical attention.\n23 February\nJuan Alexis Tineo-Martinez, 44, of the Dominican Republic, died at the Centro Medico hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nHe was taken into custody by US Customs and Border Protection air marine operations two days prior to his death, according to ICE.\nAgents contacted local 911 after Tineo-Martinez said he was experiencing leg pain, according to the agency, and he was transferred to the hospital for evaluation. The Dominican embassy in Puerto Rico did not respond to the Guardian’s query about Tineo-Martinez’s cause of death.\n8 April\nBrayan Garzón-Rayo, 27, of Colombia, died at the Phelps county jail in Rolla, Missouri.\nGarzón-Rayo’s mother, Lucy Garzón, told St Louis Public Radio that she and her family came to the US in November 2023, fleeing growing threats of violence and harassment from law enforcement in Bogotá.\nIn March Garzón-Rayo was charged with a misdemeanor for credit card fraud, and then transferred to ICE custody. He spoke to his mother a few days before he died, Lucy Garzón told SLPR, and complained about stomach pains and the poor quality of the jail’s food.\nLucy Garzón told SLPR that officials told her that her son appeared to have died by suicide. ICE has not confirmed an official cause of death.\nHis mother said that Garzón-Rayo loved riding his motorcycle, watching soccer and sledding after fresh snowfall.\n16 April\nNhon Ngoc Nguyen, 55, died at a hospital in El Paso, Texas.\nHe was apprehended in February in Albuquerque, according to his family’s lawyer, Tin Nguyen, and his partner and friends couldn’t locate him for days. Eventually, they realised he was being held at the El Paso processing center in Texas. Tin Nguyen said that Nhon Ngoc had been showing early signs of dementia and possible side effects from a head injury prior to his detention.\nShortly after his detention, he began experiencing health complications, Tin Nguyen told the Guardian. ICE eventually offered to release him, so long as his family was able to provide him with round-the-clock acute care, the attorney said – but he didn’t have health insurance and his family was unable to pay for such care. In the meantime, Nhon Ngoc’s condition began rapidly worsening. He died of acute pneumonia, according to ICE.\nNhon Ngoc had come to the US in 1983 and became a legal resident as part of the Refugee Act of 1980. In 1991, he was convicted of second-degree murder and served time at San Quentin prison, in California. After his sentence, in 2013 ICE opened a deportation case against him. While it was pending, he moved to Albuquerque and began rebuilding his life.\nHe had a loving partner and a huge community of friends, Tin Nguyen said: “He was kind.”\n25 April\nMarie Ange Blaise, a 44-year-old citizen of Haiti, died at the Broward transitional center in Pompano Beach, Florida.\nBlaise entered the US on an unknown date and location, according to ICE. She was apprehended by Customs and Border Protection on 12 February while attempting to board a flight to Charlotte, North Carolina, according to authorities.\nICE has not released an official cause of death. According to reporting by WLRN Public Media on the medical examiner’s report about her death, Blaise spoke to her son hours before she died. “She complained of having chest pains and abdominal cramps, and when she asked the detention staff to see a physician, they refused her,” her son told investigators, according to WLRN Public Media. According to the outlet, ICE offered a conflicting account, saying that Blaise did not take blood pressure medication she was offered.\n5 May\nAbelardo Avellaneda Delgado, 68, died while in transit from a local jail to a federal detention center, the first detainee to die in this manner in at least a decade.\nDelgado was originally from El Huariche, Mexico. During his nearly 40 years in the US, he raised a large family and worked on tobacco and vegetable farms, according to previous Guardian reporting.\nDelgado, who did not have legal status, was apprehended in Statenville, Georgia, on a parole violation on 9 April. His family told the Guardian they grew alarmed by his deterioration in jail, and worried about the medications he was being given.\nEventually, Delgado was transferred from the jail to Georgia’s Stewart detention center. But he never made it. Instead, he became “unresponsive” in the transport van with highly elevated blood pressure; the driver called 911, but Delgado died on the scene.\nICE has said the cause of death is under investigation and his family said they are still waiting for answers. “It bothers me,” his son, Junior, told the Guardian in June. “He was a great-grandfather.”\n7 June\nJesus Molina-Veya, a 45-year-old citizen of Mexico, died at the Stewart detention center in Lumpkin, Georgia.\nMolina-Veya entered the country without authorization on numerous occasions, starting in 1999, according to authorities. During his time in the US, Molina-Veya was arrested on charges including child molestation, a hit-and-run and possession of controlled substances, ICE said.\nOn 7 June, Molina-Veya was found unresponsive in his cell. While an official cause of death has not been released, an ICE spokesperson has called the death “an apparent suicide”. His death was the second reported in Georgia within a month, a state with one of the highest numbers of detainees in the US.\n23 June\nJohnny Noviello was found unresponsive at the Bureau of Prisons’ federal detention center in Miami.\nNoviello moved with family from Quebec to Florida in 1988 and became a lawful permanent resident in 1991. His father, Angelo, told the Guardian that Johnny was diagnosed with epilepsy shortly after he was born, and would often become ill during the winter. So the family settled in Daytona Beach, seeking a warmer climate.\nNoviello, 49, spent most of his life in Florida. He worked at a Dollar Tree and loved going to the beach and playing pool in his spare time, his father said. He maintained close ties to Canada, making regular trips to see family in Montreal.\nHe spent time in prison for selling drugs, including hydrocodone and oxycodone, but was released early on good behavior. He was apprehended by ICE agents on 15 May at the Florida department of corrections probation office. Noviello’s cause of death is under investigation.\nNoviello’s father said the family has not received an autopsy report. “We’re in limbo, we don’t know what happened,” he said. “I don’t know why they didn’t send him to Canada right away.”\n26 June\nIsidro Pérez, 75, of Cuba died at a Florida hospital of undetermined causes.\nAccording to the Miami Herald, Pérez was a mechanic and fisher from Cuba, and arrived in the US in 1966 at the age of 16.\nHe was convicted of marijuana possession in the 1980s and served time in prison. His stepdaughter told the Herald that, during his time behind bars, Pérez studied to become a mechanic, and that when he got out of prison, he began rescuing animals. “We’re all humans, you know, we make mistakes, but we remake ourselves,” she told the outlet.\nOn 5 June, five immigration officers apprehended Pérez at a community center. Officers took him to the Krome north service processing center in Miami. Three weeks later, Pérez died in ICE custody.\n19 July\nTien Xuan Phan, 55, died at the Methodist hospital north-east in Live Oak, Texas.\nPhan was detained earlier in June for failing to leave the US after a removal order, and held at the Karnes county immigration processing center in Karnes City. He was transferred to a hospital for evaluation after experiencing seizures and vomiting, and becoming unresponsive, according to ICE. His cause of death remains under investigation.\n5 August\nChaofeng Ge, 32, of China, died four days after entering ICE custody in Pennsylvania.\nGe was born in 1992 in Luoyang, Henan province, China, and worked in construction. He arrived in the US via the southern border in 2023, when he was detained for unlawful entry. According to an attorney for his family, he spent his time while incarcerated trying to learn English, practicing by writing out scripture and short stories.\nHe was eventually released and settled in Queens, New York, where he worked as a delivery driver, according to his attorney. In 2025, he was arrested for possessing several stolen credit card numbers in his cell phone and for unauthorized access to a device, and was eventually detained by ICE. ICE and the Pennsylvania state police said that he died by suicide while detained.\nHis family filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security in the southern district of New York, requesting more information about his death. “I am devastated by the loss of my brother and by the knowledge that he was suffering so greatly in that detention center,” said Yaofeng Ge in a public statement. “He did not deserve to be treated that way. I want justice for my brother, answers as to how this could have happened, and accountability for those responsible for his death.”\nGe is survived by four siblings and his parents, who live in China.\n31 August\nLorenzo Antonio Batrez Vargas, 32, died after he was detained at the Central Arizona Florence correctional complex.\nKnown as “Lenchito” by friends and family, Batrez Vargas was a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) recipient who was brought to the US from Mexico as a five-year-old. He was arrested by police in Flagstaff, Arizona, on 2 August, and charged with possession and use of drug paraphernalia. Immigration enforcement agents said they took Batrez Vargas into custody in Phoenix before transferring him to the detention center in Florence, where his family believes he contracted Covid-19, according to media reports.\nICE said that his cause of death was unknown and remained under investigation.\n“We want justice. We want this to never happen to anyone else, especially not to undocumented immigrants,” Jaime Vargas, Batrez Vargas’s uncle, told Univision.\n8 September\nOscar Rascon Duarte, of Mexico, died at a long-term medical facility while in ICE custody.\nDuarte, 58, had first come to the US in 1976, was deported in 2004 and then re-entered via the southern border. He served a 20-year sentence in prison for attempted sexual contact with a minor and child molestation. After he completed his sentence, he was transferred to ICE custody.\nAt first, he was held at the Florence staging facility, according to ICE, but was later transferred to Promise hospital in Mesa, Arizona, “due to late-stage Alzheimer disease, right kidney cancer, and hepatitis C all of which required a higher level of care”, where he eventually died, ICE said.\n18 September\nSantos Banegas Reyes, 42, of Honduras, died at the Nassau county correctional center in New York.\nHe was a construction worker and a father of two daughters, one of whom lives in the US while the other lives in Honduras, according to local news reports.\nHe was apprehended on 17 September by federal immigration agents just hours before he was found “not breathing” in his cell at the Nassau county correctional center. According to ICE, the preliminary cause of death appeared to be liver failure complicated by alcoholism. His family is contesting his cause of death, and have requested an independent autopsy.\n22 September\nIsmael Ayala-Uribe, 39, died after falling ill at the Adelanto detention center in California.\nHis mother, Lucía Uribe, told the Guardian that Ismael had come to the US from Mexico when he was five, crossing the US southern border along with his sister and cousin to join his mother and father. The family settled in Westminster, California, and later moved to Huntington Beach.\nHe spent a year studying graphic design, and then began working – first at a factory that produced cleaning supplies and later at car washes. Lucía said that Ismael loved listening to music. He was always willing to help others, and often helped his sister, a single mother, with childcare.\nUribe had been protected from deportation under the Daca program, but he was denied renewal because he had been convicted of driving under the influence.\nHe was apprehended in August during an immigration raid at the Fountain Valley Auto Wash, where he had worked for about 15 years, and was transferred to Adelanto. There, he fell ill – first with a cough and fever, and then other medical complications, according to his family. He was transferred to a hospital, where he died.\nHis mother learned of the detention through one of his co-workers, and said she was unaware of any medical condition he had. “I want to see less medical negligence,” she told the Guardian, referring to conditions at ICE detention centers.\nICE said Uribe’s cause of death was “still under investigation”.\n24 September\nNorlan Guzman-Fuentes, 37, of El Salvador, was killed when a gunman opened fire at the ICE field office where he was being held.\nHe is survived by his partner, Berenice Prieto, and four children. He had worked mowing lawns and trimming trees, and in his free time he liked fishing around the Dallas-Forth Worth area, his loved ones told CBS.\nGuzman-Fuentes was arrested by Dallas police in late August, due to an outstanding warrant for driving under the influence and other charges that were later dropped.\n“We had just bought our first home together, and he worked hard every single day to make sure our children had what they needed. His death is a senseless tragedy that has left our family shattered,” Prieto said in a public statement shortly after his death. “I do not know how to explain to our children that their father is gone.”\n29 September\nMiguel Ángel García Medina, 31, of Mexico, was killed outside an ICE field office in Dallas.\nGarcía Medina is survived by his wife, Stephany Gauffeny, two stepdaughters and a son – who was born three days after his death – his mother and grandparents, who live in Mexico, and three siblings.\n“Everyone tells me the same thing: he was very funny. He always made us laugh, and that’s why we miss him so much,” Gauffeny told the Guardian. “He was very goofy, you almost always saw him laughing, joking or singing.”\nGauffeny – who clarified to the Guardian that her husband was referred to in an ICE press release as Miguel García-Hernández, his stepfather’s last name – also said: “He was a very present father. Sometimes he wouldn’t go to work if my daughters needed something.”\nGarcía Medina was born in San Luis Potosí, a central state in Mexico, and crossed the US border without papers when he was a teenager, settling in Arlington, Texas. He met Gauffeny at a party shortly after and the two were friends for years before they became a couple.\nHe had lived in the Dallas area for nearly two decades, most recently making a living painting and remodeling homes. In his free time, he liked to work on his truck, Gauffeny said.\nHe ended up in ICE custody early on 24 September, after a short time in jail for a DUI. While he was shackled inside a government van outside the ICE field office, a gunman opened fire. He died five days later of his gunshot wounds.\nHe would have turned 32 on 5 January, which is also the day of his 10th wedding anniversary. Gauffeny told the Guardian that he had been in the process of obtaining a green card and planning to open his own painting company. “He made business cards and said he was going to buy the equipment,” she said. “He was so excited and had a lot going for him.”\n29 September\nHuabing Xie, of China, died at El Centro regional medical center in Calexico, California.\nThe border patrol had apprehended Xie on 12 September in Indio, California, and transferred him to the Imperial regional detention facility, according to ICE. In 2023, he had been placed under removal proceedings, the agency said.\nThe agency said that Xie experienced “what appeared to be a seizure and became unresponsive” and medical personnel at the detention center tried to administer life-saving measures, before emergency medical services arrived and took him to the hospital, where he died.\n4 October\nLeo Cruz-Silva, a 34-year-old man from Mexico, died while detained by ICE at the Ste Genevieve county jail in Missouri.\nA few days before he died, he was detained by police in Festus, Missouri, for public intoxication, according to federal immigration officials. The police then handed him over to ICE, which served him with a notice that the agency would reinstate a previous deportation order. Cruz-Silva had likely entered the US before 2010, when he was a child, according to immigration officials, and was expelled twice after re-entering via the southern border.\nOn 4 October, Cruz-Silva died by apparent suicide, according to ICE.\nAbout 50 people organized a vigil to mourn him. “He was a person, he was a brother, he was a son, he was a person,” Susie Johnson, the founder of Abide in Love, a non-profit that works with ICE detainees in Missouri jails, told St Louis Public Radio. “All loss of life, in my opinion, is tragic, and I hate that it happened in our community,” she said.\n11 October\nHasan Ali Moh’D Saleh, 67, died after being detained at the Krome detention center in south-west Miami-Dade county.\nSaleh, who was from Jordan, first came to the US in 1994 and became a lawful permanent resident a few months after he arrived in the country.\nSaleh managed a convenience store in Fort Lauderdale. In 2017, he was charged – along with a dozen other clerks and store owners – in a scheme to exchange food stamps for cash. He had served time in prison, and after his release in 2020, ICE placed him under an “order of supervision” that required him to regularly check in with immigration officers. In 2025, he was apprehended and placed at Krome.\nHe was taken to a local hospital due to a high fever, and became unresponsive. A physician listed his preliminary cause of death as cardiac arrest.\n23 October\nJosué Castro Rivera, a 25-year-old man from Honduras, was killed while trying to flee ICE agents in Virginia.\nHe had been on his way to a gardening job when ICE agents pulled over his vehicle, his brother, Henry Castro, told reporters. When agents tried to detain Castro Rivera and three other passengers, he fled, running into traffic. He was struck while crossing Interstate 264 in Norfolk.\nAccording to his brother, Castro Rivera had come to the US four years ago, and had been working to help support family in Honduras. “He had a very good heart,” Castro told the Associated Press. “He didn’t deserve everything that happened to him.”\n23 October\nGabriel Garcia Aviles, a 54-year-old from Mexico who had been living in the US for 30 years, died about a week after being detained by immigration agents.\nAviles was a father of two and grandfather of three, according to his family. His daughter, Mariel, told LA Taco she used to speak with him every day, and described him as someone who was “always happy and loved bikes”.\nCustoms and Border Protection agents grabbed him during a “roving patrol” in the southern California city of Costa Mesa on 14 October. Mariel last spoke with him shortly after he was apprehended, she told LA Taco. In the days that followed, his family tried repeatedly to contact him, but said that officers at the Adelanto detention facility refused to connect them.\nA week after his detention, Mariel received a call informing her that her father was in critical condition at the Victor Valley global medical center. The last time his family was able to see Aviles, he was unconscious in a hospital room guarded by immigration officers, Mariel told LA Taco.\nHis family has questioned ICE’s assessment that Aviles died of “natural causes” and complications of alcohol withdrawal. He had been healthy, his daughter said, prior to his detention.\n25 October\nKai Yin Wong, 63, of China, died at a hospital in San Antonio, Texas.\nWong had first come to the US in 1970 as a permanent resident. He was convicted of sexual abuse of a child in 2010, and served a 14-year sentence. He was then transferred to ICE custody and ordered deported from the US.\nBefore his death, he had been detained at the South Texas ICE processing center in Pearsall. In October, he was first transferred to a local hospital after he complained of shortness of breath, and then airlifted to another hospital in San Antonio when he started to experience heart failure and possible pneumonia. He was transferred to another medical center for heart valve repair surgery, according to officials, and died from complications.\n3 December\nFrancisco Gaspar-Andrés, a 48-year-old man from Guatemala, died at an El Paso hospital due to suspected kidney and liver failure, according to ICE.\nHe is survived by his wife of 25 years, Lucía Pedro Juan, and their four daughters. The couple had run a plant nursery outside Miami for a decade, and Pedro Juan has described him as a hard-working husband who fought to provide for their family.\nAccording to an interview Pedro Juan gave to the El Paso Times, the couple had gone on a grocery run during the Labor Day holiday when they were pulled over by a highway patrol officer who asked to see their identification papers, and then turned them over to ICE; they were eventually separated by immigration officers. “I hugged him, I tickled him on his ribs and I gave him a kiss on his cheek,” she said of their goodbye. “I never saw him again.” Pedro Juan was detained for three months and later deported to Guatemala.\nGaspar-Andrés ended up at Camp East Montana, a detention facility at the Texas military base known as Fort Bliss. The American Civil Liberties Union has called the facility a “human and civil rights catastrophe” following several reports of injuries, illnesses and abuses.\nGaspar-Andrés was repeatedly seen by medical staff for symptoms including bleeding gums, sore throat and body aches, fever, jaundice and hypertension. He was transferred to a hospital on 16 November, where he was diagnosed with hyponatremia. He was later placed on dialysis and palliative care, before he died in December, according to ICE.\nHis wife told the El Paso Times that Gaspar-Andrés had been relatively healthy prior to his detention, and disputed ICE’s assertion that he had hypertension or other underlying conditions.\n5 December\nPete Sumalo Montejo, 72, died at the Valley Baptist medical center in Harlingen.\nHe had first come to the US from the Philippines in 1962, as a lawful permanent resident. In 1992, he was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child and in 2024 he was convicted for possession of a controlled substance, according to ICE.\nIn February, ICE detained Montejo at the Montgomery processing center, where he began to experience several medical complications including shortness of breath and hypoxia, anemia, and septic shock resulting from pneumonia, according to the agency.\n6 December\nShiraz Fatehali Sachwani, 48, of Pakistan, died at a hospital in Fort Worth, Texas.\nHe first came to the US in 1996 as a nonimmigrant visitor, according to ICE, and overstayed his visa. He was arrested by border patrol in 2017, in North Dakota, and ordered to leave the US after he did not appear at a 2019 immigration court hearing. Then, in June, ICE located him at a jail in Euless, Texas, where he had been booked.\nHe spent more than five months at the Prairieland detention center in Alvarado, Texas, before he died. ICE has said Sachwani had a history of medical conditions – including chronic respiratory, liver and kidney issues – and died of “natural causes”.\n12 December\nJean Wilson Brutus, a 41-year-old man from Haiti, died at the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, one day after he was taken into custody.\nICE said Brutus died of “suspected natural causes”. His cousin told NBC New York that the family is still searching for answers about what happened. “We haven’t had some kind of closure surrounding his death,” Evans Belony, his cousin, told the outlet. “He was like a loved one, that we all loved, he was like a brother.”\nBrutus came to the US in 2023 as an asylum seeker, his cousin said, who added that Brutus had been “very depressed and very sad” following the death of his mother.\nThe conditions at Delaney Hall, where Brutus was held, have come under scrutiny from lawmakers and advocates. Andy Kim, a Democratic senator from New Jersey, toured Delaney Hall the day after Brutus’s death and spoke to about 80 detainees, who he said described receiving poor medical care and “disgusting” meals that included raw meat. He called for the facility to be closed.\n14 December\nFouad Saeed Abdulkadir, 46, of Eritrea died of “medical distress”, according to the agency.\nAccording to court documents obtained by the Daily Voice, Abdulkadir filed for an emergency federal motion for medical relief three days before he died.\nAbdulkadir had been an imam at the Islamic Center of Northeast Ohio, and had gained a green card in 2018. In 2023, he was charged with wire fraud and misuse of public funds and later sentenced to prison. Supporters wrote to a US district judge requesting leniency, arguing that Abdulkadir may not have fully understood the application process for the benefits programs he was convicted of misusing.\n“We miss his teachings, his knowledge. We crave him for our own sake, not just for him. He’s an actively good man,” a supporter wrote, according to the Daily Voice.\nICE took custody of him in July 2024, and detained him at the Moshannon Valley processing center in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, where he died a year and a half later. Community members raising funds for his funeral services said that Abdulkadir “spent his life selflessly caring for others, nurturing our children with the wisdom of the Qur’an, healing family rifts, and offering kindness to everyone he met. His boundless generosity touched countless souls, and the space he leaves behind feels immeasurably quiet and deep.”\n15 December\nNenko Stanev Gantchev, 56, was born in Bulgaria and died at the North Lake processing center in Baldwin, Michigan.\nGantchev was “discovered unresponsive on the floor of his cell during routine checks”, and his official cause of death is still under investigation, according to ICE.\nHe had first arrived in the US in 1995. According to the agency, Gantchev was denied a green card in 2009 and, in 2023, was ordered by an immigration judge to return to Bulgaria. He was apprehended by immigration agents in September as part of the administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz”, which sent hundreds of federal agents to Chicago to crack down on unauthorized immigrants.\nHis wife, a US citizen, told the Serbian Times that Gantchev had type 2 diabetes and had complained for months about his deteriorating health. “A man who lived here for 30 years, worked hard, paid taxes – and they treated him like an animal,” Ganchev’s wife told the outlet. “They treated him as if he were a murderer.” She learned of his death on 16 December, the day of the couple’s eighth wedding anniversary.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/04/ice-2025-deaths-timeline", "published_at": "2026-01-04T16:27:08+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

But tonight, the music is low and the loudest sounds come from the clacking of vintage mechanical typewriters. About 30 people in the bar are drafting poems about horses, sunsets and Stetson hats – which are plentiful atop the heads in the crowd.\nThey’re here to take part in Cowboy Poetry Los Angeles, a collective dedicated to preserving the history of the American west through authentic storytelling. For city slickers unfamiliar with cowboy poetry, it’s a folk art that emerged from oral traditions. Around the 1870s, during long cattle drives west from Texas, men would trade stories and sing songs about their adventures on the frontier.\nThere’s a misconception that cowboy poetry is a dying art form, but some 150 years later, the movement is experiencing a revival. The Eastwood workshops are just one example of new poetry gatherings sprouting across the nation. In 2021, Dakota Holdaway established the Juab Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Nephi, Utah. That same year, Leslie Miller launched the Rodear in Bridgeport, California, an arts and culture festival that highlights talent from young women across the west.\nWhile many of the US’s leading cowboy poets skew older, events like these are fast becoming a creative outlet for a younger, more diverse crowd. Cowboy Poetry Los Angeles stands out because it is one of the few scenes emerging in a major city.\nKristin Windbigler, the chief executive officer of the Western Folklife Center, which organizes the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada, is thrilled to see the group thriving in Los Angeles. “It allows cowboy poetry to reach an audience that it might not necessarily reach,” she said.\nOn this warm August night at Eastwood, Cowboy Poetry LA’s co-founder Amir Beardsley, 31, takes the stage. Though he’s often backed by music, today he’s performing solo to give a crisp demonstration of the art form, and chooses to recite his poem Black Friday, about the bull that nearly ended his pro rodeo career.\nHeck, they thought they killed me back in 15\nflew me out in a chopper, covered me with a sheet.\nA big bad bull whipped me down\nand sent me whirling, whirling all around.\nHe holds the microphone confidently as he paces on the stage, reciting the poem in a calm, rhythmic cadence. His free hand rests on his hip, drawing attention to an ornate belt buckle he won during a junior riding championship. The audience, some seated at typewriters, others in front of blank white pieces of paper waiting for inspiration to hit, listen in rapt attention and occasionally take notes when a piece of imagery feels particularly western, like when Beardsley compares rodeo tales to war stories.\nWhen Beardsley performs, the words flow gleefully, like he’s been telling these stories his entire life. As a teen visiting Elko’s poetry gathering, he once complimented an older poet’s reading, and the cowboy offered a bit of wisdom that would shape Beardsley’s style.\n“He said: ‘Young man, I recited that poem. I did not read it,” Beardsley said. To be a cowboy poet, one has to memorize their poems.\nA living history\nBy the time east-coaster-turned-trail-hand Jack Thorp had published the first recorded book of cowboy poems, Songs of the Cowboys, in 1908, cattle drives were on the decline. Yet the book helped spark a larger interest in the art of cowboy poetry, and people with connections to the west, whether it be through their upbringing, ranching or rodeo, began holding informal open mics where they could share their stories. In 1985, a rancher and renowned cowboy poet named Waddie Mitchell launched the first organized cowboy poetry celebration in Elko, Nevada, and today, the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering remains the largest cowboy poetry event in the nation.\nBeardsley, who grew up among cowboys in rural Red Bluff, California, started writing and attending the gatherings in high school. It was there that he learned some of the signature characteristics of a cowboy poem: vividly descriptive landscapes, honoring one’s relationships with animals and an exploration of isolation or solitude.\nBeyond that, a cowboy poem can take whatever form the author wants. It can be flowery or direct, it can rhyme or clash, and it can focus on the present instead of the past.\n“For me, it’s about the storytelling,” Beardsley said. “A lot of my poems I started out writing were telling stories about the life I lived being a young bull-rider.”\nWhen Beardsley moved to Los Angeles three years ago, he linked up with his cousin, Zane York, 33, a consultant at a skateboarding non-profit. Whereas Beardsley is often described as “the real deal” because he grew up in rural America, York, who functions as the Cowboy Poetry LA hype man, says he’s “a real California kid”. He grew up in suburban Claremont, where he skated in strip mall parking lots and developed his sensibilities from hippies and musicians. He’s the son of John York, a bassist for the band the Byrds, and inherited his father’s passion and aptitude for music, which blended perfectly with cowboy poems.\n“I don’t claim to be a cowboy,” York admits, “but I’m still a man of the west.”\nIn April 2024, an acquaintance learned about Beardsley’s poems and invited the cousins to perform at a basement concert in the Venice neighborhood. Beardsley read his poems while York strummed a backing tune on his guitar. That was the beginning of Cowboy Poetry LA. Within two years, they’d participated in more than 30 events, and have played at art openings, the western-themed wellness retreat Ranch Reset and the Autry Museum of the American West, a prominent museum in Los Angeles.\nThe cousins had both performed at the open mic at the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering and wanted to share their love for the art form with their generation. As millennials, Beardsley and York are younger than the typical cowboy poet. Most of the famous wordsmiths, like Mitchell and Red Steagall, are well into their 70s and 80s; in Elko, there are even discounted tickets for attendees under the age of 35.\nBeardsley and York wanted to jump right into a Los Angeles gathering, but they couldn’t find many local poets. They realized they’d have to teach the craft to their peers, and that they could take advantage of the current trend of cowboy-core to build intrigue. Between the Yellowstone series setting streaming records and Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter tour raking in millions, western culture is more popular than ever, and the cousins attract newcomers to their workshops by advertising live country music, which takes place after the workshop, and a prize for the best western wear. It’s just a bonus that guests will also learn about the art, write a poem on a vintage typewriter, read it on stage – and maybe get hooked\nDespite leaning into the current western fads, Beardsley and York don’t want writers to slip into a caricature, as they consider it a reductive portrait of the cowboy. Rather, they want to help people embrace that authenticity actually means recognizing that the west has always been a diverse place.\nYork points out that “Gene Autry was the first movie star in the USA, and he was a white cowboy who had a rifle and fought Indians”. Unlike these Hollywood stereotypes that embody colonial ideas like manifest destiny, machismo and hyper-masculinity, the cowboy evolved from vaqueros, or Mexican cattle ranchers, and historians estimate that one in four cowboys were Black.\nThis issue is deeply personal to the cousins, who identify as Arab Americans of Jordanian descent. Beardsley said that he never met another Middle Eastern competitor while on the pro rodeo circuit, and thinks he may have been the first. Other riders would razz him for his heritage, but it only made Beardsley bolder, and he commissioned a pair of chaps with the colors of the flag of Jordan to wear during competition.\n“I say I’m half Jordanian, half cowboy,” Beardsley says.\nAn intergenerational community\nWindbigler has worked hard to bring more poets under the age of 40 to the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, and at the next event, they’ll represent at least one-third of the lineup. Windbigler is especially thrilled to welcome Los Angeles Cowboy Poetry as special guests for the upcoming gathering in January, where they’ll be bringing their typewriters and facilitating a workshop similar to the one they host at Eastwood.\nShe also pushes back against the idea that cowboy poetry is a dying art, noting that the gathering’s ticket sales have grown 53% in the past decade. In 2025, roughly 8,000 people came to Elko, surpassing the peak attendance the gathering attracted in its early heyday.\nAs cowboy poetry gains renewed popularity with young folks, it also sparks dialogues between generations. Elders pass on their lyricism, knowledge and stories, helping the younger poets become stronger writers. In return, the younger generation preserves their mentors’ legacies by learning their poems and reciting them at their events, helping the tradition stay alive.\n“Our whole deal is passing on these creative traditions to the next generation,” Windbigler said. “You can’t do that if the older generation isn’t there or the younger generation isn’t there.”\nBack at Eastwood, Beardsley gently checks in on the burgeoning poets. He weaves through the crowd with a black cowboy hat filled with poetry prompts for struggling authors. They include wistful images, like “write from the perspective of someone watching a cowboy ride away”, and reflective challenges, including “a moment when the rope missed – or landed – at exactly the right time”.\nThe bar hosted events throughout the autumn, including one in November attended by Charles McGarrigle, 30, a story producer in the entertainment industry. At that event, he wrote a poem about his partner, Lauren Hofschneider, 31, a psychology professor, who was born on the island of Saipan and moved to California after she turned 18. Despite the apparent cultural differences between islanders and people from the west, Hofschnieder’s journey of migration and isolation, of moving alone from a small, remote town to a hustling city, felt in line with the cowboy experience.\n“I don’t see myself as a cowgirl, obviously, but him phrasing it that way made me realize there have been many moments in my life where I was wandering alone,” Hofschneider said.\nThis was McGarrigle’s second workshop, but his first time reading a poem. “I didn’t perform because I was almost intimidated by so many cowboy hats and thinking that I didn’t belong, and I’m a poser,” he explained. “But Amir and Zane do such a good job of reassuring the crowd by saying, even though the theme is cowboy poetry, it’s just about getting up on stage.”\nKatie Meza, who attended her first workshop in August, also felt that Beardsley and York quickly embraced her.\n“I’ve never touched a horse in my life, but we all get to appreciate the culture equally,” Meza said.\nShe came to the August event with her ex-boyfriend, Michael Salonius, 51, an elk rancher from Crescent City, Oregon. The 13th-generation mountaineer grew up hearing cowboy poetry in his hometown bar, and was excited when he discovered the event through Instagram. He was bracing for a dingy room with just a handful of old men, and was shocked by the young, energetic crowd.\n“It exceeded my expectations,” Salonius said. “To see this many young people doing it, taking it seriously, and the diversity of poems … ” He trailed off, then cracked a wide smile. “It’s fucking rad,” he said.\nTowards the end of that night, Jarod Ramirez, 25, took the stage. He grew up in Hesperia, a town surrounded by the Mojave desert, and said the workshop was helping him reconnect to his roots. His grandfather was born in New Mexico, and Ramirez remembered him as the embodiment of a western lifestyle. He sported his grandfather’s old silver bolo tie, which was in the shape of a bean and embedded with red and blue turquoise stones.\n“This is my first time doing cowboy poetry, so we’ll see if it’s good or not,” Ramirez said, then launched into An Ode to the Hatch Chili:\nGreen or red\nthe favorite color can end in a brawl.\nBut you’re more subtle than that.\nIf asked, I’d say green,\nif one appreciates the color of cacti and spikes of Joshua trees,\nred if you’re hot-blooded and savor the sunset.\nBut what is it that makes you so special?\nBeing of Old Mexico. I’ve had my fair share of spices\nbut my New Mexican family\nhad some kind of magic.\nThey capture the taste of a wild desert, fire,\nand put it on the top of my tongue.\nThe audience loudly clapped and cheered. With that, Ramirez was on his way to becoming a cowboy poet; all he needs to do is write, be kind and nurture his appreciation for the west.\n“I like to tell folks being a cowboy, it’s not what you do, but who you are and how you respect yourself, others and the land,” Beardsley said.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/04/cowboy-poetry-new-generation", "published_at": "2026-01-04T16:00:12+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

When Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s Quds force was killed in a targeted strike during Trump’s first presidency in January 2020, the gang was punctiliously consulted, people involved in that operation have said.\nIn one fell swoop, the capture appeared to render the 1973 War Powers Resolution obsolete, if not an outright work of fiction.\nThe 1973 act – passed in the wake of the Vietnam war amid widespread anxieties about an incipient “imperial presidency” – requires a president to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying troops into hostilities and withdraw them after 60 days, unless Congress authorizes the action or declares war.\nIt was a reaction to Lyndon Johnson’s perceived abuse of the notorious Tonkin Gulf Resolution of 1964, an ostensibly narrow measure that Johnson ultimately exploited to pursue unlimited war in Vietnam.\nYet long before the operation to seize Maduro, Trump had in effect communicated that he considered such congressional limits null and void by offering up a raft of alternative legal justifications – including executive orders declaring the Venezuelan leader and his henchmen “narco-terrorists” and thus potentially subject to similar precepts that governed the post-2001 “war on terror”.\nIts effectiveness in constraining presidents from acts of war has long been shown to be limited, as the prolonged wars in Iraq and Afghanistan attest – although George W Bush received congressional authorization in both cases.\nThe 1989 invasion of Panama – carried out under the administration of George HW Bush to unseat the central American country’s dictatorial ruler, Manuel Noriega – was conducted without a former declaration of war or specific congressional approval. Bush, however, had taken care to garner bipartisan support on Capitol Hill beforehand.\nNor did Barack Obama seek specific prior congressional approval before the operation to kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, but instead acted under the authority of the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), passed by Congress after the 11 September 2001 al-Qaida terror attacks on New York and Washington.\nUnder Trump 2.0, no approval was sought for the mass military build-up off Venezuela’s shores or the estimated 35 lethal strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats that have killed at least 115 people since last September. Similarly, the deployment of a vast military force off Venezuela, including the largest US aircraft carrier, was carried out without seeking authorization.\nThe disdain implicit in the explanations from Trump and Marco Rubio as to why information on the Maduro raid was withheld even from senior congressional figures – that they cannot be trusted because they might leak – is unmistakable.\n“It’s just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say: ‘Hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days,’” Rubio told reporters.\nStung by this haughty disregard, congressional Democrats hit out ferociously on Saturday, with insistent demands to be briefed on future actions.\n“President Trump has made no secret of his intentions to effectively abolish the Congress, and that pattern continues today with his flagrant disregard for the Article 1 war powers of Congress, which is essential to our constitutional system of checks and balances,” said Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker.\nMark Warner, the Democrat’s ranking member on the Senate’s intelligence select committee and a member of the gang of eight, said: “Our constitution places the gravest decisions about the use of military force in the hands of Congress for a reason. Using military force to enact regime change demands the closest scrutiny, precisely because the consequences do not end with the initial strike.”\nAnd, Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator for Virginia who last month tabled a war powers resolution seeking to rein in the administration’s actions in Venezuela, said: “It is long past time for Congress to reassert its critical constitutional role in matters of war, peace, diplomacy and trade.”\nHe added: “Where will this go next? Will the president deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies?”\nYet it is hard not to detect an air of impotent futility in the Democrats’ chorus of indignation.\nWith the exception of a few known Republican rebel figures such as Thomas Massie, a representative from Kentucky, Republican criticism was muted, whatever private misgivings some might have about Trump’s extravagant assumption of presidential powers at their expense.\nMatt Duss, a former foreign policy adviser to Bernie Sanders, the leftwing Vermont senator, cited Mike Lee, a Republican senator from Utah, as an example of how far the party’s members in Congress have ceded ground to the president.\nHaving initially voiced reservations about the lack of authorization from Congress, Lee sharply changed tack – apparently after speaking to Rubio - saying that Maduro’s arrest was within “the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect US personnel from an actual or imminent attack”.\nDuss contrasted Lee’s supine stance with his previous actions, when he jointed Sanders to support a war powers resolution aimed at restricting US support for Saudi Arabia’s military intervention in Yemen during Trump’s first term.\n“Senator Lee spoke very eloquently about the constitutional principles at stake, and that was just when the United States was only supporting the Saudi emirati war in Yemen,” said Duss. “So for him to come out now and say the president has inherent authority to invade a country and kidnap a foreign leader without any authorization from Congress, is just wild.\n“It’s been clear for a while that he, along with many other Republicans, have decided that their political careers depend on staying in the good graces of Donald Trump and there’s really no past principle that they won’t abandon.”\nDuss said the instruments available to Congress under the War Powers Resolution were no longer fit for purpose. He suggested that the legislation needed to be rewritten, in the manner of the national security powers reform bill, which Sanders introduced – ironically, along with Lee – during Trump’s first presidency.\nThe legislation was never enacted and even if reintroduced and passed would likely be vetoed by Trump – even if the Democrats were to recapture one or both chambers of Congress in November’s midterm elections.\nShort of a foreign policy disaster in Venezuela that could produce a groundswell of Republican opinion that might then yield a Senate supermajority to override a presidential veto, such legislation’s only hope, Duss conceded, is the future election of a sympathetic Democratic president.\n“That is a situation unfortunately that I think the framers of the constitution did not really anticipate,” he said. “Given that so many of the kind of separation of powers and the checks and balances presume that you’re going to have leaders who care about the law and who care about these processes.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/04/trump-congress-venezuela-attack", "published_at": "2026-01-04T15:28:08+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

However, the country holds about 17% of global crude oil reserves, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\nTrump’s intervention could deepen a supply glut in the market, as the president has pledged that US oil companies will “go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country”.\nSo far none of the biggest US oil companies have spoken about the president’s claim that they are prepared to spend billions to rebuild the Venezuelan oil industry. However, a former top Chevron executive, Ali Moshiri, has said he is raising $2bn for Venezuelan oil projects.\nMoshiri, who was formerly head of Chevron’s Latin American operations, told the Financial Times that his Amos Global Energy Management fund had identified Venezuelan assets and was preparing to make an investment.\n“We have been anticipating this breakthrough for a while and our $2bn private placement memorandum is ready to go with several investment targets identified,” he said.\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said that a fall in oil prices could be “short lived” as investors assess how long it would take for extra Venezuelan oil to affect the global market.\nShe said: “The type of investments needed include upgrading old and decaying infrastructure, drilling new oil wells and building more refineries to process Venezuela’s heavy crude oil.\n“Optimising resource-rich Venezuela to generate the income needed to turn the country around could take until 2030 and beyond.”\nBrooks noted that the country pumped nearly 3.5m barrels a day at its 1998 peak, far exceeding the 1m a day now.\nElsewhere, China’s top financial regulator, the National Financial Regulatory Administration, has asked its policy banks and other big lenders to report their exposure to Venezuela, according to Bloomberg, as the Chinese banking sector prepares for potential shocks.\nDespite the geopolitical upheaval over the weekend, the OPEC+ oil group did not signal a shift in strategy at a scheduled update on Sunday. The group, which includes Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, agreed to maintain their pause on production increases until at least April.\nThe price of gold rose by 2% to $4,413.93 on Monday. The metal is considered a traditional safe haven asset, and typically rises during periods of uncertainty. Silver also rose by as much as 3.5%.\nBoth metals hit record high prices last year, driven by global economic and political uncertainty, as well as expectations around interest rate cuts and large purchases of bullion by central banks.\nThe price of bitcoin has also been rising on geopolitical uncertainty, ticking up by 1.1% to $92,504 on Monday.\nAsian markets were buoyant, posting their strongest start to a year since 2012.

We’re hope so … hopeful that it does. Positive results. For the people of Venezuela, but ultimately, most importantly, for us, in the national interests of the United States.”\nHe added that the US would “set the conditions” so that Venezuela is no longer a “narco-trafficking paradise” aligned with US adversaries including Iran and militant proxies such as Hezbollah.\nABC anchor George Stephanopoulos asked a follow-up question. “What is the legal authority for the United States to be running Venezuela?”\nRubio responded: “I explained to you what our goals are and how we’re going to use the leverage to make it happen.”\nThe previous day Trump, speaking at a press conference in Florida just hours after the strikes and raid on Caracas and elsewhere in Venezuela, said the US would run Venezuela “with a group” and would be “designating various people” in charge, while pointing to Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Dan Caine, behind him.\nTrump also said that Maduro’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, now considered the interim president by Venezuelan leadership, had spoken to Rubio and had told the US she would do whatever it needed, with Trump adding: “She really doesn’t have a choice.” Rodríguez appeared on state television in Venezuela not long afterwards and, in contrast, was sharply critical of the US actions and insisted that the country “will never again be anyone’s colony”.\nRubio told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday morning that actions were different from rhetoric and it was too soon to know how the Venezuelan leadership would now respond to the US’s audacious action in the country and, now, pressure to conform to US plans to stop drug trafficking and control its oil operations.\n“We are going to make our assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly. We’re going to find out. Do I know what decisions they’re going to make? I do not. But I know that if they don’t make the right decisions the United Sates will retain multiple levers of influence to ensure our interest are protected and that includes the oil quarantine that’s in place, among other things … we’re going to see what they do.”\nAnd Rubio told NBC that the US was not at war in Venezuela and did not currently have US forces on the ground there.\nIn response to anchor Kristen Welker asking if he, Hegseth or any of the US leadership Trump indicated was going to be running Venezuela during its transition, Rubio said: “Well, it’s running policy … we want Venezuela to move in a certain direction.”\nSenator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas and the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, also rowed back on Trump’s assertions, saying there were “still a lot of questions to be answered” about what happens next in Venezuela.\nWhen asked who was running Venezuela right now he responded: “Who is not running Venezuela is Maduro.”\nCotton said Rubio was in consultation with the Venezuelan government and with the opposition to “see what a transition government would look like … we will see whether they [the post-Maduro Venezuelan leadership] will let the opposition back into the country and hold elections.”\nTrump on Saturday was dismissive of the opposition, headed by recent Nobel peace prize winner María Corina Machado, who is in exile, saying she did not have sufficient support and respect in Venezuela, without being more specific about whether he was referring to leadership, the military or voters.\nMeanwhile, on Sunday Trump threatened Rodríguez that “if she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”\nIn a telephone interview with the Atlantic magazine Trump also appeared to acknowledge US aspirations in the country as amounting to something congressional Democrats say they were explicitly told was not the plan – regime change.\n“You know, rebuilding there and regime change, anything you want to call it, is better than what you have right now. Can’t get any worse,” Trump said.\nCotton said the US did not recognize Rodríguez as legitimate. Maduro was widely considered to have lost the 2024 presidential election in Venezuela, but stayed in power anyway.\nHe added: “The new leaders of Venezuela need to meet our demands,” he said. “Our demands are … that we want them to stop the drug trafficking. We want them to stop the weapons trafficking. We want them to expel the Cubans and the Iranians and the Islamic radicals.”\nCongressman Jim Jordan, a Republican representing Ohio and the chairman of the House judiciary committee, also could not confirm that the US would run Venezuela.\nWhen asked directly on CNN what Trump meant when he indicated that the group standing behind him at the press conference would be in charge of the plan for the US to run the country, Jordan said: “We do not know exactly what that means.” When asked what is next for Venezuela, he said: “We’ll see.”\nAnd despite the mandate of the US Congress to act as a check on executive power and interrogate controversial actions such as the Venezuelan operation, Jordan said he trusted Trump, Rubio and Hegseth in “making the best decisions” and he trusted the US military.\nThe Democratic congressman Jim Himes said that Jordan’s answers were “giving the game away” that the Republican-controlled Congress was not interested in acting as a check on the White House and condemned the intervention in Venezuela as an “imperial adventure”.\nMeanwhile, earlier on CBS, Rubio referred to the current Venezuelan regime and defended the US decision not to remove more of Maduro’s inner circle.\n“You’re gonna go in and suck up five people?” he said. “Okay, they’re already complaining about this one operation. Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people … we got the top priority, the number one person on the list.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/04/venezuela-trump-rubio-republicans", "published_at": "2026-01-04T18:02:39+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

For a time when there were at least concerted attempts to justify unilateral interventions and illegal wars in the name of global security, and even a moral duty to liberate the women of Afghanistan or “free the Iraqi people”.\nNow, as the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, is in essence abducted and Venezuela taken over by the US, there is barely any effort to situate the coup in any reasoning other than the US’s interests. Nor are there any attempts to solicit consent from domestic or international law-making bodies and allies, let alone the public. The days of the US trying to convince the world that Saddam Hussein did in fact have weapons of mass destruction despite secretly having no reliable intelligence were, in fact, the good old days.\nMaduro “effed around and found out”, said the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth. “America can project our will anywhere, any time.” The US will now “run Venezuela” said the president, Donald Trump. “We are going to have a presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil.” There is little to no effort to make reasonings for the takeover cohere. It is claimed that Maduro is guilty of “narco-terrorism” and other charges including “Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns [sic] and Destructive Devices against the United States” – charges that not only fail to clear the bar required for invasion and abduction, but also apparently are not even taken that seriously by Trump himself. Others charged with drug offences have been pardoned. Among them are Honduras’s former president Juan Orlando Hernández and Ross Ulbricht and Larry Hoover, both released from life sentences for convictions including drug trafficking.\nThe point, as demonstrated by triumphalist posts on social media that include hip-hop-soundtracked montages and Trump as a sort of gangster in chief, is in the very rebuke of the notion that US actions are subject to due process. The Venezuela coup is not an exhibition of the long arm of the law, but the fact that the US is the law and is not subject to any higher one, able to wield its extraordinary power and lethality in the dead of night, kill dozens of innocents and face no consequences, let alone censure.\nAnd the response so far has proven this to be correct. These extraordinary scenes, actions and statements are already being passed into the realm of the normal by the sort of bland, hedged statements that we have grown accustomed to. Several politicians and heads of state have engaged in the sort of feeble and contradictory statements they make when their kind of diplomacy collides with the reality that their allies are out of their minds. Keir Starmer says that the situation is “fast moving” and that he will “establish all the facts”, just as the facts are marching Maduro on a perp walk in Brooklyn. The EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is “following very closely the situation in Venezuela … any solution must respect international law and the UN Charter”. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas reassures us that it is “closely monitoring the situation”, as is the Australian government and others.\nWhat you will be reminded of with increasing frequency, once there are no more facts to be established or live situations to monitor, is that Maduro was a very bad man. Even if the importance of international law is proclaimed, it will be done in tandem with condemnation of Maduro. The British foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, always out in front, leads the charge with this platonic ideal. Point number one, she tweeted on Saturday: “The UK has consistently rejected Nicolás Maduro’s legitimacy, and called for a peaceful transition of power in Venezuela.” Two, she added: “As the prime minister has made clear, we support international law. Our collective focus must now be on achieving a transition without bloodshed to a democratic government.” Note that there is no acknowledgment that international law was already violated, and by whom – only that it is supported, but apparently in no ways in which it can actually be upheld.\nThe upshot is that we kick off a year in which the die is cast. The Venezuelan incident will shred whatever little remained of the pretence that there is any will to stand up for norms that underpin global security – that sense that there will be consequences, either material or social, that deter land grabs, annexations or regime changes. The world is already ripe for such a moment. The Middle East is a hotspot, maturing into a competition between rising Gulf states, and further unsettled by an unfettered US and Israel. We see this in Palestine, Syria and Lebanon. It is a mere blip on the news map now, but Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two powerful, previously close allies with increasingly ambitious regional agendas, are facing off over Yemen and the sides in the conflict that each support there. The escalation in rhetoric and military action – Saudi Arabia struck a UAE shipment of combat vehicles headed for Yemen and accused the country of endangering its national security – opens an unprecedented front in the Gulf.\nSuch chaos has already been enabled by the UAE’s new questionable, imperial role in the region and beyond in Sudan’s cruel war, and that country joins the club of nations that face no repercussions. On the other side of the Gulf, protests in Iran are in their second week and have already captured the interest of Trump, who has threatened more strikes, taking the prospect of US-led regime change there out of the realm of the unlikely. As is Trump’s threatened annexation of Greenland.\nOther improbabilities become possibilities. China is performing military drills around Taiwan. Vladimir Putin needs little encouragement, but the Trumpian doctrine of imperial dominion and discretionary right to launch military campaigns now mirrors Putin’s own, and further imbues Russia’s actions in Ukraine with validity. After Venezuela, you would be mad, if you were a regime with some measure of financial and military strength and regional ambition, not to test the waters at least.\nThe tepid response from those who still feel the need to restate support for international law does nothing but contribute to this state of encouraged predation. The situation in Venezuela cannot be contained with peaceful transition (which is unlikely if the entirety of recent history is anything to go by). Just as Gaza could not be contained. One could argue that it is wise not to anger Trump – not even with a statement of the truth of his actions – and ask what a country such as the UK could do anyway. But resisting the violation of rules and insisting on adherence, even if certainly in vain, is how norms are established and then maintained. Lying low and hoping that this too shall pass is cowardice, denial and historical illiteracy.\nThe consequences will be reaped increasingly, and not just by the unfortunate in faraway places. Fences, both practical and notional, that maintained a settlement – fragile and flawed, but a settlement nonetheless – are being dismantled. Silence is not safety. It is, to use the language of the day and channel the jubilant Hegseth, “effing around” and “soon finding out”.\n-\nNesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/05/donald-trump-coup-venezuela-break-rules-regret", "published_at": "2026-01-05T06:00:29+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Not only does it show contempt for the EU and its “weak” leaders, but it also targets European citizens and migrants with racist dog whistles and barely disguised Islamophobia. Yet instead of a rousing defence of the bloc’s commitment to human rights and equality, there have just been bland platitudes.\nAntónio Costa, the president of the European Council, denounced Trump’s plans to boost support for Europe’s far-right parties. But there was no public challenge to the racist logic underpinning his argument. Costa, who has spoken proudly of his mixed ancestry, could have made a convincing counterargument to the US president’s false premise that Europe was heading for “civilisational erasure” because of migrants and, by extension, millions of Europeans of colour.\nUrsula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, insisted that the best response to the Trump administration’s insults was standing up for a united Europe, focusing on its strengths and taking pride in the EU. There was no reaffirmation of the compelling vision she outlined only two years ago of an inclusive EU “where it doesn’t matter what you look like, who you love, how you pray, and where you are born”.\nThe truth is that Trump’s alternative reality about a “woke” Europe is laughable. He would feel quite at home in today’s EU. Far-right parties are on the rise, and the rhetoric of “defending civilisation” – part of the “great replacement” conspiracy discourse – has seeped from the far-right fringes into the political mainstream. Von der Leyen’s own conservative bloc increasingly relies on far-right votes to move legislation through the European parliament. If Trump were to visit “Brussels so white”’s institutions, the US president would likely not run into many people of colour.\nThe US and EU’s methods for dealing with unwanted migrants are beginning to converge. The EU might not deploy the masked ICE-style paramilitaries who stalk American streets, but its new migration pact tightens asylum procedures, accelerates deportations and expands detention. Many EU countries want additional “innovative solutions”, which include increased powers for Frontex, the EU border control agency accused of systemic human rights failures, including being complicit in illegal pushbacks. Twenty-seven European states have asked for a revision of the European convention on human rights because, they argue, migrant rights must be balanced against Europeans’ “security” and “freedom”.\nAll of this is right up Trump’s street but is against Europe’s own interests. With ageing populations and labour shortages hollowing out entire sectors, the EU does in fact need migrants. The commission has identified shortages in 42 occupations, including jobs in construction, transport, agriculture, hospitality, health and social care, which are essential for Europe’s economic resilience and “strategic autonomy”. That is why, even as politicians compete to sound tougher on borders, no one is saying that many of their governments are, in fact, quietly signing labour partnerships with the global south.\nThe US president claims that nationalist parties are victims of censorship, but it is Europe’s progressives, especially those advocating for solidarity and justice for Palestinians, who face restrictions. UN experts have had to tell Germany to stop the persistent pattern of police violence against Palestinian solidarity activism. Meanwhile, in France a major international academic conference on Palestine was forced out of the Collège de France in November, as a minister publicly labelled the event as “activist”.\nThose who cover European policies understand that in addition to politicians’ outbursts of moral panic, the EU has perfected a polished, technocratic form of exclusion that relies on directives and regulations, coded language about “European values” and a securitisation framework that normalises human rights exemptions. Sometimes, even the facts are denied: the lower house of the Dutch parliament refused to discuss a government-commissioned study that found that anti-Muslim discrimination was structurally embedded in society – and young Muslims increasingly feel they do not belong.\nEurope’s political and media ecosystems have helped construct an “imaginary Muslim” who is a suspect and a security risk – and never a doctor, a nurse, a scientist or an elected representative, Dutch socialist MEP Mohammed Chahim told me. Nothing, not even evidence-based research, is allowed to go against the dominant narrative.\nI wish Europeans of colour truly wielded the power that the US president attributes to us. We do not. Many remain marginalised and stigmatised, and face structural discrimination. Yet countless others – far from plotting the demise of European “civilisation” – are working to ensure that Europe survives and thrives through their contributions across politics, business, technology, culture, sport, media, medicine, design, transport, academia and more.\nThe question is whether Europe’s leaders – or at least those who are more responsible – will finally speak up. Trump’s fantasy of resurrecting a white, Christian Europe is certainly providing oxygen for his European acolytes who frame Europeans of colour through the tired lens of migration “crises”, identity threats and endless integration tests. Those who do not subscribe to this toxic fiction must have the courage to say so publicly and celebrate the diversity of Europe.\n-\nShada Islam is a Brussels-based commentator on EU affairs.

Geoffrey Robertson KC has gone so far as to suggest that what occurred was an act of US aggression against Venezuela, which is one of the most serious violations of international law. Russian aggression against Ukraine in February 2022 and the ongoing war that resulted has had an ongoing legacy.\nWhile Australia has been fierce in its condemnation of Russian aggression in Ukraine, the Albanese government’s response to events in Venezuela has so far been muted. But there are significant implications for US allies and partners.\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\nThe Trump administration says it “will run” Venezuela (a claim top Republicans are already backpedaling). How it will do so is unclear without US boots on the ground. However, as the Trump administration has a narrative of the Maduro regime being intertwined with drug cartels responsible for a flood of drugs into the US, there is every prospect of the US also seeking to replace Venezuela’s acting president, Delcy Rodríguez, with a more sympathetic regime.\nThe White House has also indicated it will seek to control Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. Setting aside that US seizure of Venezuelan oil would be a further violation of international law, it is difficult to see how this could be achieved without US boots on the ground or a complicit Venezuelan government.\nWhile there needs to be caution in reading US conduct in Venezuela too widely, given the very particular political and regional content, there are some concerning trends for US allies such as Australia. Those include the increasing willingness of the Trump administration to use military force to advance US national interests. That can be seen by how the US conducted airstrikes in June against Iran in support of Israel and against Islamic State in Nigeria in December, and airstrikes at sea against Venezuelan-linked drug trafficking small craft in the Pacific and the Caribbean. To date, this more assertive US defence conduct has not spread to the Indo-Pacific but there is no reason to suggest that it will not do so during the remaining three years of the Trump presidency.\nThe US has rarely encountered a robust military response from its recent adversaries but the Indo-Pacific is a very different region from the Caribbean and Latin America. Assertive US defence activity in the Indo-Pacific against drug cartels, so-called “shadow fleets” at sea carrying sanctioned oil, or the Chinese coast guard or PLA navy contesting the US freedom of navigation assertions will result in a heightened regional military response.\nFor Australia, given that it is deeply entwined in the US military and security framework through Anzus and Aukus, this has particular legal and defence implications. If US military action in the region was challenged, would that trigger Australia’s Anzus treaty obligations, and how would Australia precisely come to the aid of Trump-inspired US military adventurism?\nThese are questions that Australia must ask itself. At their core they go to whether the Trump administration is truly committed to the rules-based international legal order that Australia as a middle power places so much store in. The postwar UN Charter framework has received ongoing bipartisan support in Australia. The Trump presidency may be proving even more of a test for the UN Charter and its values than even the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n-\nDonald Rothwell is professor of international law at the Australian National University\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/05/us-violated-international-law-venezuela-australia-questions", "published_at": "2026-01-05T04:15:51+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The decision to unilaterally attack another country and abduct its leader – days after he publicly sought an off-ramp – has still wider repercussions. It should alarm us all.\nVenezuelans have endured a repressive, kleptocratic and incompetent regime under Mr Maduro, widely believed to have stolen the last election. They now face profound uncertainty at best. Mr Trump has suggested that Mr Maduro’s deputy, Delcy Rodríguez, would follow US instructions, and dismissed the rightwing opposition leader and Nobel prize-winner María Corina Machado as a plausible replacement. But Ms Rodríguez, now interim president, has so far struck a defiant tone – and other parts of the decapitated regime are more hardline.\nA man who won power promising to abandon foreign wars now says he is “not afraid of boots on the ground”. Rebranding the Department of Defense as the Department of War was more than posturing. He does not see the world’s superpower as policeman; he is turning it into a rogue state. He believes the US’s might allows it to do as it wishes with minimal cost: witness the strikes on Nigeria, on Iran’s nuclear facilities and elsewhere. He promises that Venezuelan oil means this latest episode “won’t cost us a penny”.\nGeorge W Bush invaded Iraq on a lie. But this illegal attack came without UN resolutions of any kind or congressional approval; Democrats were not even informed and say they were actively misled in briefings. Mr Trump doesn’t seek to bend international norms, but to destroy them. Put aside the message this sends to Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and others, and ask where the US itself is heading. While the raid reportedly killed 40 Venezuelans, including civilians, no US personnel died. Mr Trump’s growing sense of invincibility will surely embolden further adventurism. He has not ruled out military action over Greenland and told Fox News: “Something is going to have to be done with Mexico.”\nNo one buys the pretext that this is about drugs. Venezuela is only a minor conduit for cocaine; Mr Trump recently pardoned the former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández for drugs and weapons crimes. And Mr Trump himself made it clear that he is driven by the lure of oil as well as machismo, the ideology of some in his administration, and the desire for glory as domestic popularity wanes.\nThe global reaction, especially in Europe, has – with honourable exceptions – been shockingly muted. That’s not due to Mr Maduro’s sins, but fear of Mr Trump’s wrath. The strong reaction from the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, was welcome, but this episode underscores the institution’s growing irrelevance. Mr Trump’s anti-interventionist domestic base could yet press him to turn attention back home – but soaring healthcare premiums, economic unhappiness and the Epstein files increase his appetite for distraction.\nWe are not yet 12 months in to his four-year term. Sir Keir Starmer and others may regret it if they stay silent now, given what – and who – could be next.\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He is also the youngest mayor of the largest city in the United States for over a century, having received more votes in November’s election than any candidate since the 1960s. And politically, he is probably the most leftwing incumbent of the office since Fiorello La Guardia in the 1930s and 40s.\nHardly surprising then, that Mr Mamdani’s extraordinary rise to prominence should be accompanied by high expectations and tense anticipation. At last Thursday’s inauguration ceremony, he promised to “govern expansively and audaciously”. Whether he succeeds in doing so will have considerable ramifications for progressive politics more widely.\nPledging to make New York “a city we can afford”, Mr Mamdani campaigned on plans to introduce free universal childcare, hugely increase the availability of cheaper housing, and generally reduce everyday costs of living for residents. In order to finance this programme, he has restated his intention to raise tax rates on the very wealthy, and on corporations. Linking the vision of a livable metropolis to a politics of redistribution, this approach has assembled a coalition of voters ranging from young renters to union members, migrants and the professional middle classes.\nProgressive parties around the world have taken note. The political dynamics of New York, the home of Wall Street and a global centre for the arts, are not straightforwardly generalisable. But the affordability agenda that delivered Mr Mamdani’s flagship success has also fuelled a political revival for Democrats in states such as New Jersey and Virginia. In Europe too, the centre-left has fared best when focusing relentlessly on improving everyday life for the less well-off. The surprise victory of the D66 party in the recent Dutch election, for example, was largely attributed to its apparent seriousness about addressing the Netherlands’ chronic housing shortage.\nMr Mamdani thus finds himself a youthful trailblazer for a radical politics of civic renewal and inclusion that, if it works, could counter more generally the rise of the populist far right. Donald Trump promised a “blue-collar boom” when he was re-elected. He has instead presided over a widening equality gap, in which the wealthy have disproportionately benefited from tax cuts and a soaring stock market. There is space here for a new working-class politics of the left. In that spirit, Mr Mamdani’s head of budget, Sherif Soliman, has stated that New York needs to be a livable home not just for Wall Street bankers, but for “low-wage workers, be it in retail or healthcare”.\nFormidable headwinds await, not least federal funding negotiations with a hostile Mr Trump, and opposition to what – in historical terms – would be modest tax rises for high-income earners. There will also need to be some skilful coalition-building, not least with the Democratic governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, who has previously spoken out against the hikes. Nevertheless, the political courage shown by New York’s charismatic new mayor during his ascent to power suggests that, in the heartland of global capital, he has the ability to make a difference. In an era in which swathes of blue-collar voters continue to drift rightwards, the stakes are high indeed.\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But you should. This year, there will be a significant amount of tax refunds. Why? Well, it’s not tariff cash. It’s because many people overpaid their taxes this year.\nFor example, service workers who receive tips will be getting refunds. Thanks to Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), a new provision allows them to deduct up to $25,000 per individual for any tipped income they received during the year. But I bet even when the bill passed, few changed their withholdings to reflect this deduction. If you’re part of that group, then it’s very likely you had too much withheld … and paid too much tax. When you file your 2025 return between now and 15 April – and take advantage of this deduction – you’ll find out you owed less taxes than you estimated. Hence the refund.\nThe same goes for workers receiving overtime pay. There’s a new deduction that will allow individuals to deduct up to $12,500 of their overtime pay received in 2025 (it’s $25,000 for joint filers). Similarly for service workers, it’s a deduction you take when you file your 2025 returns. I’m betting if you received overtime during the year, your withholdings didn’t reflect that either. So you’ll probably be getting money back on the taxes you overpaid.\nThere are caveats. State and local taxes may both still apply. Employment taxes – social security and Medicare – aren’t affected. Both deductions start to phase out if you make more than $150,000. Not all tipped workers are eligible (here’s a list to check). Thanks to the shutdown, the IRS didn’t have time to update W-2 wage reporting forms to reflect these changes. And employers weren’t given much guidance as to how to calculate these amounts.\nFor example, did you know that your overtime wage eligible for the deduction would only be the differential between your normal hourly rate and your overtime rate? So if you got paid time and a half for overtime and your normal rate is $20 an hour, you would receive $30 an hour – but your deduction is on the $10 difference. I’m not sure all employers will do these calculations correctly, so be careful – any mistakes are the taxpayer’s responsibility.\nIt’s not just people who received tips and overtime that have new tax benefits.\nOlder adults – subject to some limitations – will get an additional $6,000 deduction this year over and above their standard deduction. If you run a small business, you’ll receive higher deductions for first-year depreciation and research and development costs. If you haven’t taken advantage already, you can contribute more to a flexible savings account (which reduces your taxable income) and contribute up to $5,000 to a “Trump savings account” this year and annually, which, while not reducing your income, will allow your newborn to accrue earnings tax-free through the age of 18 and then withdraw the funds without penalty.\nThese deductions aren’t one-offs. Which is why it’s important that if you get a refund this year, make sure to adjust your withholdings for 2026 to reflect your updated taxable income for the current year. This way, you can increase your net pay and put more money in your pocket during the year instead of waiting until you file your 2026 returns in 2027.\nThere are many critics of the OBBBA and they legitimately argue that the bill has many downsides – increasing deficits, taking away critical benefits and reducing spending in needed areas are among the biggest. Those issues aside, the bill does include significant tax benefits for many, benefits that may hopefully make a difference to both consumers and the economy at large.\nThe OBBBA is law. However you feel about it, take advantage. File your 2025 tax returns as soon as possible. Get your refund.

Though Trump’s electoral victories cannot be attributed to any one thing, his “America first” narrative certainly struck a chord.\nBut Trump’s use of force to seize the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, his full-bore support for Israel’s demolition of Gaza and his bombing of Iran’s nuclear enrichment installations show that he’s no less willing than his predecessors to resort to military interventions.\nTrump already had Maduro in his sights. He offered a $50m bounty for information leading to his capture, blockaded Venezuelan ports to stop sanctioned oil tankers and accused Maduro of involvement in drug trafficking. Still, it’s a safe bet that few outside the administration expected Trump to swoop into a country, grab its president and haul him to the US.\nMaduro will be tried for drug trafficking and “narco-terrorism” conspiracy, a fuzzy formulation suitably ominous to justify a move of dubious necessity and legality. The Trump administration hasn’t provided evidence tying Maduro to narcotics trafficking, nor has it proven that Venezuela posed a clear and present danger necessitating an armed attack.\nVenezuela has many problems, including drug gangs and authoritarian rule, but they hardly justify what Trump has done. If bad governance and repression by foreign leaders justify abducting them, Trump has a long list of offenders to choose from, including some backed by US economic and military support.\nTrump’s move can’t be justified by self-defence provisions in international law. Venezuela never threatened to attack the US (it lacks the capacity to do so), let alone attacked it. It’s the other way around: the US has attacked Venezuela and taken steps, such as the naval blockade, generally used in wartime.\nTrump says that the US constitution permits his intervention – that as commander in chief, he is duty bound to protect American personnel in danger. But Venezuela hadn’t put any US personnel at risk, let alone harmed them. Plus, Trump was building a case for tightening the screws on Maduro, and the Venezuelan leader would have been a fool to provide him with a casus belli.\nTrump’s most prominent charge against Venezuela’s government is that its drug traffickers have, with Maduro’s complicity, deluged the US with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, which is also used to alleviate severe pain. Even a 2 milligram dose can prove fatal.\nThe illegal use of fentanyl and other opioids in the US has certainly been rampant and deadly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that deaths tied to synthetic drug overdoses, mainly fentanyl, soared from 782 in 2000 to 72,776 in 2023. However, they are estimated to have plummeted to 47,735 in 2024. Even so, the Trump White House reckons that the costs attributable to “illicit opioids, primarily fentanyl” (including death, treatment, crime and lost labour productivity) totalled $2.7tn in 2023.\nThe question, however, is what Venezuela has to do with any of this. Virtually all of the fentanyl smuggled into the US comes from Mexico, by way of China, which supplies the precursors, something the Trump administration itself concedes. The president nevertheless told an audience of top military officers in September that the US was attacking boats off Venezuela’s coast because they “were stacked up with bags of white powder that’s mostly fentanyl”.\nAnd Trump contends that Maduro is directly linked to Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua criminal gang, adding that it’s “threatening an invasion” of the US – but, again, without providing proof and ignoring the fact that the gang has no army. Besides, Maduro’s government has been on the offensive against the group in recent years. The president also insists that Venezuela “previously stole” oil and land that belonged to the US and that he would get these “assets” back. Like his other allegation, this one is fact-free.\nVenezuela began nationalising its oil industry in 1976. Hugo Chávez, who served as president from 1999 till his death in 2013, expanded that policy. He mandated in 2007 that PDVSA, the state oil company, take a majority stake in projects in the oil-rich Orinoco region, including those of the US petroleum behemoths ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, both of whom wound up their operations rather than comply, unlike Chevron, BP, Norway’s Statoil and France’s Total. But there are no grounds for claiming that either the US government or any US petroleum company literally owned Venezuela’s oil or land and was robbed.\nThe possible consequences of Trump’s intervention are worrisome for at least two reasons.\nFirst, we can’t know what will follow Maduro’s abduction. Venezuela’s state institutions, including the security services, remain intact and an interim president is in place – Delcy Rodríguez, who has been vice-president since 2018. But if street protests segue into clashes between the people and the state, things could quickly spiral out of control, just as they could if Trump’s interventionist agenda expands and encounters resistance.\nVenezuela’s main opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who was awarded the 2025 Nobel peace prize, welcomed US pressure to topple Maduro well before he was captured. Now she has hailed Venezuela’s “hour of freedom”. That could provide Trump cover to go further, though, as for Machado herself, he says she “doesn’t have the support within or the respect” to govern. Already, he has announced that the US will “run” Venezuela temporarily, suggesting that he plans to do more than simply put Maduro in the dock. The same can be said for his arrogating the right to open up Venezuela’s oil sector to investments from US corporations.\nSecond, Iran’s government is facing a nationwide uprising, and Trump warned that “we are locked and loaded and ready to go” if the regime starts killing protesters. Some have already been killed. It’s hardly a given that Trump’s Venezuelan gambit will tempt him to try regime change in Iran. But if he does wade into Iran’s upheaval, the consequences – for Iran, the US and Iran’s neighbours – will be much more dangerous than anything that might happen in Venezuela. And Trump is nothing if not unpredictable.\n-\nRajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/04/donald-trump-usa-venezuela-coup-maduro-iran", "published_at": "2026-01-04T13:00:07+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Instead, his 16-18 record was not enough to save his job after a year that began with optimism the Falcons would reach the playoffs for the first time since 2017.\n“I have great personal affinity for both Raheem and Terry and appreciate their hard work and dedication to the Falcons, but I believe we need new leadership in these roles moving forward,” owner Arthur Blank said in a statement.\n“The decision to move away from people who represent the organization so well and have a shared commitment to the values that are important to the organization is not an easy one, but the results on the field have not met our expectations or those of our fans and leadership. I wish Raheem and Terry the absolute best in their future pursuits.”\nThe Falcons finished with four straight wins and in a three-way tie for first place in the NFC South, but the surge came after the team had already been eliminated from playoff contention. Carolina won the division on the basis of a superior record in divisional games.\nBlank attended Morris’s postgame news conference and hugged the second-year coach afterward. Asked whether he expected to return, Morris said: “You know, my expectation is always to be back, right?” He then looked at Blank and added: “I’m going to coach this football team as long as he allows it.”\nWhen asked whether he had discussed his job status with Blank, Morris said: “You can’t worry about those things. The boss is sitting right there. This is a business. Those decisions will be made at the proper time.”\nFontenot was hired as general manager before the 2021 season.

They said they were aiming to offer representation for players who are independent contractors in a largely individual sport.\nOne of the goals made clear along the way was to become a full-fledged union that negotiates collective bargaining agreements like those that exist in team sports, although that has not happened.\nDjokovic said on X on Sunday that he had “ongoing concerns regarding transparency, governance, and the way my voice and image have been represented”.\nThe PTPA filed a class-action lawsuit in March against the women’s and men’s tours, the International Tennis Federation and the sport’s integrity agency, accusing the organisations of “systemic abuse, anti-competitive practices, and a blatant disregard for player welfare”. The four grand slam tournaments were later added as defendants.\nDjokovic was not listed as a plaintiff when the suit was filed; Pospisil and other players were.\nThat is because, Djokovic said in March, “I want other players to step up.”\nThe lawsuit argues that players should gain access to more earnings, saying that the governing bodies that oversee the four Grand Slam tournaments – Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open and the Australian Open – and other professional events “cap the prize money tournaments award and limit players’ ability to earn money off the court.”\nDjokovic said on Sunday he “will continue to focus on my tennis, my family, and contributing to the sport in ways that reflect my principles and integrity.

Are you staying up? Enjoy the drama if you are but it is past my bed time as usual. Thanks everyone for joining me over the past few months. It has been wild, wonderful and completely knackering. So goodnight, but who knows we might run it back next week for the playoffs! Goodnight!\nFinal scores: Chiefs 12-14 Raiders, Commanders 24-17 Eagles\nThe Raiders hold on to the No 1 pick in the draft thanks to the Giants winning earlier while the Commanders enjoy a win that forces the Eagles to pick up the No 3 seed for the playoffs. They welcome the 49ers to town next week.\nThe New York Jets are the first team in NFL history since records began in 1933 to not record a single interception. It defies belief how this is even possible. Surely you would pick one off by accident, it happens all the time. Apparently not.\nDetroit kick the walkoff field goal but Chicago need not worry as Philadelphia look set to lose to Washington. Chicago own the No 2 seed in the NFC and welcome Green Bay to Soldier Field.\nLA score 21 unanswered points to finish this one in a whirlwind. The Rams take the fifth seed in the NFC and travel for a favourable matchup with the Panthers while the 49ers are bumped down to the six seed and head to Philadelphia as it stands.\nNew England look locked for the No 2 seed as Denver have just kicked another field goal to lead 19-3 in Mile High. The Patriots will host the LA Chargers as it stands next week.\nChicago record another pick to take their season tally to a ridiculous 23. They are driving as per usual with two minutes remaining and the game on the line. Not much at stake mind but it would be nice to earn the No 2 seed rather than have it handed to you.\nWeird score alert! Shane Buechele takes a sack in the end zone for the Chiefs. Your guess is as good as mine. Raiders have teed off today with six sacks in total.\nPoints alert! After five possessions without any points Denver add a field goal to the … er … field goal they scored early in the third quarter. Bo Nix continues to struggle with 10/19 for 96 yards. That’s it.\nSky Sports are saying Matt Stafford deserves the MVP. I could not disagree more. The award should be for more than one-yard passes on the goal line a la Aaron Rodgers in his prime with the audible away from the run. Davante Adams is the real MVP.\nAnother punt for Denver goes through the back of the end zone and brings out Trey Lance. On the opening play at the 20-yard line they gain seven on the ground through Kimani Vidal.\nNew England have been dominating on the ground. Stevenson has an incredible 131 yards on just seven carries with two scores while TreVeyon Henderson has 51 yards on 11 carries and one touchdown. Even Drake Maye is averaging 8.3 yards per carry on four totes. Bull. Dozing.\nI’ve got mail! And it concerns Washington’s quarterback Josh Johnson …\nJames Syme writes, “Josh Johnson is a 39-year-old journeyman who holds the record for having been a member of the most NFL teams (14). That doesn’t capture the full glory of his career, as he’s been signed to several teams multiple times, including four stints at the 49ers.\nThere’s a great anecdote about his first period at Washington: Johnson said that he played a Madden NFL video game to help learn the names of his new teammates.”\nGotta do, what you gotta do, James! And keep trucking Josh. I just expect Colt McCoy to be under center in these situations from now to eternity.\nTwo touchdowns without reply forces the Rams down to the sixth seed as we stand with the 49ers popping up to fifth in the NFC. Another shocker in the works for the Rams potentially.\nNow the Broncos are moving! Bo Nix finds Evan Engram with a deep ball for 37 yards that puts them on 1st and Goal. A stuffed run and two incompletions later and they chip the shot through the posts. A touch disappointing?\nI am reliably informed no team has ever not recorded at least one interception in an NFL season. The Jets are only a little over 22 minutes from pickless history!\nIn other struggling QB news, Caleb Williams is picked off by the Lions leaving Chicago’s hopes of the No 2 seed pinned on the Eagles losing to the Commanders. Williams is 9/17 for 66 yards and that pick.\nLA’s defense keep rolling by forcing a three and out. Denver really struggling to move the ball. Bo Nix is 6/12 for 38 yards, no touchdowns and no picks. Ice cold.\nThe Chargers show some life. They will be quietly pleased with the finish after doing next to nothing leading up to their final drive of the half. A huge shock is still on the cards should LA’s defense keep stopping Denver. Three punts from the Broncos and a field goal the only points produced by the offense.\nLance is almost picked several seconds after saying he was growing into the game. Next on 3rd and 10 the snap doesn’t come off in time so that is a delay of game penalty. A great throw and catch moves them into the red zone.\nThe Rams back on track to end their two-game losing run. Matt Stafford will need to go a bit further to win the MVP award from Drake Maye. Brilliant one-handed grab from Puka Nacua.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2026/jan/04/saints-v-falcons-colts-v-texans-and-titans-v-jaguars-nfl-gameweek-18-updates-live", "published_at": "2026-01-05T00:42:31+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Chris Boswell missed the extra point, giving the Ravens a chance to win with a field goal.\nJackson, dealing with a painful back contusion, passed for 238 yards and three scores, including a pair to Zay Flowers in the fourth quarter. Each of Flowers’ TDs put Baltimore in front.\nPittsburgh responded each time, and will now welcome the Texans while looking to end a playoff victory drought that stretches to the 2016 AFC championship game.\nNew Orleans Saints 17-19 Atlanta Falcons\nDee Alford’s red-zone interception stopped a potential go-ahead drive by New Orleans, and the Atlanta Falcons beat the Saints 19-17 on Sunday to give the NFC South title to the Carolina Panthers.\nBy closing the season with four consecutive wins, the Falcons (8-9) finished in a three-way tie with Carolina and Tampa Bay for first place in the NFC South. The Panthers won the tiebreaker with the best record within the division.\nThe Falcons completed a season sweep of the Saints (6-11), who had their four-game winning streak end.\nTrailing 16-10, the Saints drove from their 25 to the Atlanta 20 before Alford returned his interception of Tyler Shough’s pass intended for Dante Pettis 59 yards to the Saints 27 with 3:14 remaining. The play set up Zane Gonzalez’s fourth field goal, a 38-yarder, to extend Atlanta’s lead to nine points.\nShough answered with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Ronnie Bell with 1:11 remaining, but Atlanta’s Kyle Pitts recovered an onside kick.\nCleveland Browns 20-18 Cincinnati Bengals\nMyles Garrett set the NFL’s single-season record with his 23rd sack and Shedeur Sanders led a late scoring drive that was capped by Andre Szmyt’s 49-yard field goal as time expired to help the Cleveland Browns rally for a 20-18 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in the season finale Sunday.\nGarrett sacked Joe Burrow with 4:09 remaining in the fourth quarter for the record-setting sack, surpassing the 22 and a half by Michael Strahan and TJ Watt. Burrow was in the shotgun formation on first-and-10 at the Browns 45-yard line.\nAfter Ja’Marr Chase’s four-yard touchdown catch gave the Bengals (6-11) an 18-17 advantage with 1:29 remaining, Sanders directed a 10-play, 40-yard drive to give the Browns (5-12) two straight victories for the first time in two years.\nSanders was 3 of 6 passing for 33 yards on the final drive, including an 11-yard completion to Jerry Jeudy with 31 seconds left to get the Browns in Szmyt’s range. Dylan Sampson had two carries for seven yards to get it closer for Szmyt.\nSanders finished 11 of 22 for 111 yards. He also had a fumble in the first quarter that led to Cincinnati’s first touchdown.\nDallas Cowboys 17-34 New York Giants\nJaxson Dart threw the 14th and 15th touchdown passes of his rookie year and the New York Giants ended their lost season on a two-game winning streak by beating the Dallas Cowboys 34-17 on Sunday.\nThat and other results around the NFL took the Giants (4-13) out of the running for a top-two pick and clinched No 1 for Las Vegas. New York routed the Raiders last week to end a nine-game skid.\nDart has said he cares more about winning than draft position and played like it in his 12th professional start. He was 22 of 32 for 231 yards with TD passes to Daniel Bellinger – on a shovel pass-and-run – and Tyrone Tracy.\nWhile the Giants were shorthanded because of injuries and illnesses, they treated this like any other game with their starters going the distance. Dallas (7-9-1) took it more like an exhibition game, including Dak Prescott exiting after halftime.\nPrescott completed seven of 11 passes for 70 yards and lost a fumble off a botched snap before being replaced at quarterback by Joe Milton to begin the third quarter. Prescott finished the season with 4,552 yards passing, the second most of his decade-long career behind only 4,902 in 2019.\nGreen Bay Packers 3-16 Minnesota Vikings\nJJ McCarthy had a productive first half before he was injured again, fullback CJ Ham rushed for a short touchdown, and the Minnesota Vikings finished a frustrating season by beating the resting Green Bay Packers 16-3 on Sunday.\nGreen Bay (9-7-1) were locked into the No 7 seed in the NFC playoffs and had nothing to play for.\nMcCarthy, who went 14 for 23 for 182 yards passing, pulled himself out after his first throw of the third quarter so the athletic training staff could examine his right hand and did not return. Backup Max Brosmer took it from there, helping Justin Jefferson reach the 100-yard mark for the first time in 12 games as the Vikings (9-8) coasted to their fifth consecutive victory.\nJefferson had already secured his sixth straight 1,000-yard season, only the third receiver in NFL history to accomplish that feat.\nWith Jordan Love safely watching on the sideline and Malik Willis recovering from injuries, the Packers gave Clayton Tune his second career start at quarterback and netted minus-7 passing yards. Dallas Turner had two of Minnesota’s four sacks that racked up 41 lost yards for Green Bay.\nTennessee Titans 7-41 Jacksonville Jaguars\nTrevor Lawrence threw three touchdown passes, breaking the franchise’s single-season record for total scores, and the Jacksonville Jaguars won the AFC South and earned a home playoff game with a 41-10 drubbing of Tennessee on Sunday.\nIt was most lopsided outcome in series history.\nThe Jaguars (13-4) clinched their third division title in nine years, swept the Titans (3-14) for the third time in four seasons and topped a dozen wins for just the second time in the team’s 31-year history.\nJacksonville, though, will have to wait several hours to learn its postseason seeding and opponent. The Jaguars could land the AFC’s No 1 seed but more likely will end up as the third and host Buffalo, Houston or the Los Angeles Chargers next week.\nNo one should want to play the Jaguars, who have won eight in a row and nine of 10 since their bye. And Lawrence has been the hottest quarterback in the league during the streak.\nIndianapolis Colts 30-38 Houston Texas\nCJ Stroud accounted for two touchdowns and Ka’imi Fairbairn made a go-ahead field goal with 12 seconds left to lift the Houston Texans to a 38-30 win over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday that extended their winning streak to nine games.\nThe victory gives the Texans (12-5) the No 5 seed in the AFC playoffs.\nDefensive tackle Tommy Togiai scooped up a fumble on the final play and returned it 17 yards for a touchdown to pad the lead.\nThe Texans clinched a third straight postseason berth last week and they had a chance to win the AFC South with a victory and a Jacksonville loss. But with the Jaguars up big over the Titans at halftime, coach DeMeco Ryans opted to rest quarterback Stroud, defensive stars Will Anderson Jr, Danielle Hunter, Derek Stingley and several other starters after the break.\nThe Colts led 30-29 after a field goal with about two and a half minutes to go before Fairbairn’s 43-yard kick put the Texans on top 32-30 and gave him a career-high six field goals in the game.\nKansas City Chiefs 12-14 Las Vegas Raiders\nDaniel Carlson made a career-long 60-yard field goal with eight seconds left to give Las Vegas a 14-12 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday and end the Raiders’ 10-game losing streak.\nCarlson and Kansas City’s Harrison Butker each made four field goals, with Butker hitting a 41-yarder with 1:01 left to give the Chiefs a short-lived 12-11 lead.\nThis was the first victory for the Raiders (3-14) over the Chiefs (6-11) at Allegiant Stadium. The Chiefs, who had won all five previous meetings in Las Vegas, lost their sixth straight game and eighth in 10.\nLas Vegas’ Ashton Jeanty rushed for 87 yards, giving him 975 for the season that is second among Raiders rookies to the 1,150 yards Josh Jacobs gained in 2019. Jeanty’s 1,321 yards from scrimmage broke the club rookie record set by Jacobs (1,316).\nMuch of the intrigue about the outcome was eliminated before kickoff when the New York Giants defeated the Dallas Cowboys 34-17, guaranteeing the Raiders the top pick in this year’s NFL draft. A Giants loss would have meant that Las Vegas would get that selection only with a loss to the Chiefs.\nNew York Jets 8-35 Buffalo Bills\nAfter taking the first snap, Josh Allen headed to the sideline and joined the 70,000-plus fans to watch backup Mitch Trubisky throw four touchdown passes as the Buffalo Bills bid a likely farewell to their long-time home with a 35-8 rout of the New York Jets on Sunday.\nGabe Davis caught two touchdown passes and Ty Johnson had a TD run and a scoring catch in an outing during which the playoff-bound Bills (12-5) rested a majority of their starters.\nBuffalo’s defense, meantime, manhandled an injury-depleted and backup-filled Jets offense that was blanked through three and a half quarters and finished with 122 yards offense and nine first downs.\nThe win, coupled with the Los Angeles Chargers’ loss at Denver, led to Buffalo moving up one spot in clinching the No 6 seed. The Bills will travel to play the AFC South champion Jacksonville Jaguars in the wild-card round next weekend.\nIt’ll be the third playoff meeting between the teams, with Jacksonville winning both. The Jaguars defeated Buffalo 30-27 in what stood as Bills Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly’s final game in 1996. More recently, the Jaguars beat Buffalo 10-3 in 2017 in the Bills first playoff appearance after ending a 17-year postseason drought.\nArizona Cardinals 20-37 LA Rams\nMatthew Stafford passed for 259 yards and threw two of his four touchdown passes to Colby Parkinson, and the Los Angeles Rams secured the No 5 seed in the NFC playoffs with a 37-20 victory over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.\nTyler Higbee returned from injury with five receptions for 91 yards and a key fourth-quarter TD for the Rams (12-5), who will visit the NFC South champion Carolina Panthers (8-9) in the wild-card round.\nPuka Nacua made a one-handed TD grab among his 10 catches for 76 yards for the Rams, who snapped their first two-game skid of the season. Stafford passed Dan Marino for seventh place on the NFL’s career TD passes list while finishing his MVP-caliber season leading the NFL with 4,707 yards passing and 46 TDs – the second most in league history by a quarterback at least 37 years old.\nSean McVay’s team clinched its third straight playoff berth last month, but the Rams blew the No 1 overall seed with road losses to Seattle and Atlanta in their past two games. Now they’ll have to win in Charlotte, where they lost 31-28 on 30 November.\nMcVay went against his usual policy and didn’t rest his starters for the relatively meaningless regular-season finale because he wanted his team to snap out of its costly two-game slump.\nLA Chargers 3-19 Denver Broncos\nThe Denver Broncos secured the AFC’s top playoff seed with a 19-3 win over the Los Angeles Chargers’ bevy of backups Sunday, a victory fueled by Ja’Quan McMillian’s 45-yard interception return for a touchdown.\nWil Lutz was 4-for-4 on field goals as the Broncos (14-3) tied their franchise record for most victories in a season and earned their first No 1 playoff seed since 2015, which they parlayed into a third Super Bowl title.\nThey’ll get a week off before hosting their first playoff game in a decade, which could be against these same Chargers (11-6) if L.A. beats the Patriots (14-3) at New England in the wild-card round next weekend.\nBroncos quarterback Bo Nix had one of his worst games of the season, throwing for just 38 yards in the first half and 141 overall, but he tied Russell Wilson’s record of 24 wins in his first two NFL seasons.\nWith no chance to win the division, the Chargers treated this game much like a bye week as they prepare to hit the road for the playoffs in the wild-card round. Coach Jim Harbaugh sat several of his starters, most notably quarterback Justin Herbert, safety Derwin James and OLB Tuli Tuipulotu.\nMiami Dolphins 10-38 New England Patriots\nRhamondre Stevenson ran for two touchdowns and caught another from MVP contender Drake Maye, and the New England Patriots completed their remarkable turnaround season with a 38-10 win over the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.\nStevenson rushed seven times for 131 yards as New England posted its first sweep of the Dolphins since the 2016 season. TreVeyon Henderson added touchdown runs of 2 and 5 yards.\nThe Patriots finished 14-3, their most victories since they won the Super Bowl to cap the 2016 season. The AFC East champions will be No. 2 seed in the playoffs and host the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Chargers in the wild-card round next weekend. Denver prevented New England from earning the AFC’s top seed by beating the Chargers 19-3 on Sunday.\nMiami (7-10) finished with its second straight sub-.500 season under coach Mike McDaniel following back-to-back playoff appearances in his first two seasons.\nMaye completed 14 of 18 passes for 191 yards and a touchdown before taking a seat early in the fourth quarter. Henderson’s five-yard TD run was set up by a 56-yard run by Stevenson on the second play of the Patriots’ game-opening drive.\nDetroit Lions 19-16 Chicago Bears\nJared Goff led five scoring drives, Jake Bates kicked a 42-yard field goal as time expired and the Detroit Lions regrouped to beat the NFC North champion Chicago Bears 19-16 on Sunday after blowing a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter.\nThe Bears (11-6) stumbled into the playoffs with back-to-back losses, though they secured the No 2 seed in the NFC with Washington beating Philadelphia. Chicago will host Green Bay in a wild-card game next week and would have home-field advantage in the divisional round if it beats the Packers.\nCaleb Williams set the franchise’s single-season passing record and threw two fourth-quarter touchdown passes as the Bears wiped out a 16-0 deficit.\nThe Lions (9-8) ended a disappointing season on a winning note when Bates nailed a 42-yarder. A 26-yard pass from Goff to Amon-Ra St Brown helped set up the field goal, and Detroit came out on top after losing three in a row.\nWashington Commanders 24-17 Philadelphia Eagles\nThe Eagles’ backup plan backfired, and the Super Bowl champions will start their postseason defense of the title as the No 3 seed in the NFC.\nWith Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley and most key Eagles starters sitting out even with playoff seeding at stake, the Washington Commanders got fourth-quarter passing and rushing touchdowns from Josh Johnson to beat Philadelphia 24-17 on Sunday.\nThe NFC East champion Eagles (11-6) will open the playoffs at home next weekend against San Francisco.\nThe Eagles needed help to earn the No 2 seed. They had to beat the Commanders and Detroit needed to win at Chicago. Sure enough, the Lions beat the Bears 19-16 to add some sting to the Eagles’ loss.\nWith Jayden Daniels shut down and Marcus Mariota dealing with a leg injury, the Commanders (5-12) started Johnson, their 39-year-old third-stringer. Johnson rallied the Commanders from a 17-10 hole with a two-yard touchdown pass to John Bates and then scored on a one-yard run with 2:32 left.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/04/nfl-roundup-week-18-scores", "published_at": "2026-01-04T21:19:59+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Total FTSE 100 dividend payments are expected to set a new record of £85.6bn in 2026, Mould reported, finally eclipsing the peak of £85.2bn set in 2018.\nA poll by the trading company eToro found that UK retail investors are optimistic about the year ahead, with 53% confident the current bull market will continue throughout 2026.\nUK bonds could do well\nRobert Timper, the chief global fixed income strategist at BCA Research, said it could be a strong year for UK government bonds, known as gilts, if the Bank of England cuts interest rates more rapidly than other central banks.\nHe predicted: “UK gilts will go from second to the best-performing bond market [in 2026], backed by a dovish BoE and reduced fiscal concerns.”\nGlobal markets forecast to rise\nUBS has predicted that “supportive economic conditions should underpin global equities, which are expected to rise by about 15% by the end of 2026”, with gains likely in the US, China, Japan and Europe.\nDouble-digit gains are expected on Wall Street. Under UBS’s base case scenario, the US S&P 500 index would end 2026 at 7,700 points – a gain of 12.5%.\nDeutsche Bank has a year-end S&P 500 target of 8,000 points (+17%), while Oppenheimer Asset Management is even more bullish, forecasting an 8,100-point year end.\nAccording to the consultancy Oxford Economics, above-consensus growth and below-consensus headline inflation in the US next year will lift US stocks.\nUBS also recommends Chinese stocks. “China’s tech sector stands out as a top global opportunity,” it said. “Strong liquidity, retail flows and earnings – expected to rise to 37% in 2026 – should sustain momentum for Chinese equities.”\nOstrum Asset Management predicts European equity markets will perform positively in 2026, driven by a return to earnings growth. However, it cautioned that this is dependent on companies’ ability to deliver against high expectations.\nBut the investor Michael Burry, featured in the film The Big Short, doesn’t share the optimism, saying he sees several “bad years ahead”.\nArtificial intelligence impact\nAfter a year in which hyperscalers invested hundreds of billions in AI infrastructure, the technology sector is likely to shape long-term macroeconomic outcomes in 2026.\nInvestors will be watching to see whether big AI companies justify their huge valuations – after strong stock market gains in 2025 – and deliver the productivity growth that policymakers are hoping for. If not, valuations could suffer.\nThough many argue AI investment remains at the early-adoption stage, there are concerns that some players are entwined with their own suppliers and partners. That circularity blurs the true financial picture, creating fragilities that could splinter if AI optimism fades.\nWhile much of the AI focus in 2025 was on chatbots, the UBS chief investment officer, Mark Haefele, said capital expenditure in the sector could focus on agentic AI (systems or “agents” that can carry out knowledge work with little or no human prompting), physical AI (such as robots and self-driving vehicles) and AI video.\nUBS predicts about $4.7tn will be spent on AI capital expenditure globally by 2030 – roughly double the $2.4tn already planned, based on more than 40 announcements this year.\nThe economic outlook\nThe world economy is expected to avoid a downturn in 2026, despite the rise in trade barriers in 2025. Kathleen Brooks, the UK research director at the broker XTB, predicts it will remain resilient, with little chance of a global recession.\nGoldman Sachs analysts have told clients that the main risks to global growth in 2026 are that a fragile job market sparks recession fears, or the equity market questions the value of AI-related revenues.\nGoldman anticipates “sturdy global growth of 2.8% in 2026”, with the US economy forecast to “outperform substantially” thanks to reduced drag from tariffs, tax cuts and easier financial conditions. It also expects China to hold up well, as strong exports outweigh sluggish domestic demand.\nUBS believes the global economy is poised to accelerate in 2026, helped by improved business and consumer confidence and extra fiscal stimulus in some advanced economies.\nThe Dutch bank ING said it is “still relatively upbeat” about the US economy, expecting looser financial conditions to support growth in 2026.\nDeutsche Bank suggested the US midterm elections, due in November, could influence policy earlier in the year as Republicans try to avoid losing seats.\nCommodities\nThe price of oil will be highly sensitive to geopolitical developments during 2026, such as progress towards ending the Russia-Ukraine war and conflict in the Middle East. Forecasts of a supply glut could also push prices down.\nThe advisory company Oxford Economics predicts Brent crude oil will end 2026 at $58 a barrel, down from $60 last month, and drop further to $55 in 2027.\nMeCopper prices could be pushed up by shortages. Deutsche Bank predicts a “clear deficit” for the copper market in 2026, leading to peak prices in the second half of the year.\nCentral banks and rates\nThe money markets are pricing in two US interest rate cuts by December 2026, though this forecast is dependent on the outlook for the US economy and Trump’s choice for the next Fed chair.\nRichard Carter, the head of fixed interest research at the wealth manager Quilter Cheviot, said markets would be “on high alert for any erosion of Fed independence”.\nIn the UK, one rate cut in 2026 is fully priced in, but several economists predict the Bank of England will ease rates at least twice.\nWhat could go wrong?\nExperienced City voices know that the market consensus will inevitably be wrong – the question is in which direction.\nDario Perkins, an economist at the forecasters TS Lombard, suggested the picture could be stronger than expected.\n“The consensus: 2026 will be just like 2025,” he told clients. “Steady global growth, a bit of disinflation, and monetary policy returning to neutral, where it stays indefinitely. Zzzzz.”\nHe continued: “Where could the consensus be wrong? Our bet is on a stronger rebound in activity, which stokes inflation and starts a debate [in the second half of the year] about monetary tightening.”\nBut William Davies, the global chief investment officer at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said “the risks of a misstep are accumulating”.\nHe warned: “Growth has proven surprisingly durable, inflation has moderated (albeit unevenly), and markets have continued to climb. But beneath the surface imbalances are building. We believe the coming year will be defined by how successfully policymakers and investors can navigate the narrowing path.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/04/global-economic-outlook-2026", "published_at": "2026-01-04T12:00:07+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

After attacking Caracas and taking the country’s leader captive , Trump promised to take control of Venezuela’s oil industry with the help of America’s biggest oil companies.\nVenezuela’s beleaguered oil industry could “make a lot of money” with the might of the US behind it, Trump told the press, claiming that the new regime would invest billions to revive its fortunes.\nHow much oil does Venezuela have? Venezuela is believed to have the largest oil reserves of any country in the world. The exact reserves remain uncertain but the state claims they could be as large as 300bn barrels, easily surpassing those of Saudi Arabia. Other estimates suggest Venezuela’s reserves of crude oil could represent about 17% of the world’s total.\nBut the South American country has only ever pumped a fraction of its potential production. When Hugo Chávez, the populist former president, rose to power in 1999, the country produced about 3.5m barrels of oil a day, making it one of the top 10 crude producers in the world at the time.\nA quarter of a century later, neglect, poor infrastructure, under-investment and corruption have eroded the country’s oil industry and its economy. Venezuela’s output is roughly 1m barrels a day – compared with the more than 13m barrels of crude produced daily in the US.\nWhat role could US oil companies play? Trump has promised that “very large” US oil companies will spend billions of dollars to fix the “badly broken infrastructure”.\nThe oil companies potentially in line to invest include Exxon Mobil, the largest US oil company, and the Texas-headquartered Conocophillips, both of which were active in Venezeula’s oil industry before it was nationalised by Chávez. Only Chevron, the US’s second largest oil company, has continued to operate in the country.\nSo far these companies have remained non-committal , with statements from ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips stopping short of confirming the US president’s investment plans.\nJorge León, the head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, an industry consultancy, said: “My hunch is that if President Trump said this publicly, probably there was already an agreement with the US companies.”\nUnder the new regime, US oil companies could follow the playbook used in many developing nations by partnering with the state oil company, PDVSA, to develop and produce crude in exchange for a share of the profits. The parlous financial state of PDVSA means US companies are likely to be able to negotiate a good return on their investments.\nBut even with a united effort of the US president and some of the world’s biggest oil companies, success is not guaranteed. “History shows that forced regime change rarely stabilises oil supply quickly, with Libya and Iraq offering clear and sobering precedents,” Leon added.\nWhat does this mean for Venezuela’s current oil customers? The vast majority of crude produced by Venezuela, about 80%, is exported via supertankers to China. The world’s biggest oil importer takes the shipments as repayment for loans it extended to the country under Chávez.\nChina is Venezuela’s biggest lender and, while the total financial support is not known, some estimate that it could include $105bn in loans and other financial commitments to the South American nation between 2007 and 2016.\nBy wresting control of Venezuela’s oil industry, the US has in effect gained control of billions in expected repayments, and a key source of cut-price energy for China’s developing economy.\nThe Chinese foreign ministry has condemned the US actions. In a social media post it said it was “deeply shocked” by the “blatant use of force against a sovereign state and action against its president”.\nMarket observers have speculated that Venezuelan crude could now be redirected to US refineries in Louisiana. This would allow more US crude to be exported on the international market and boost Trump’s mission to establish the US as a world-leading energy superpower.\nIt is possible that any future oil shipments to China, produced by US oil companies, would be charged at prices closer to the market rate – a blow to Beijing’s efforts to secure energy at the lowest possible cost.\nTrump told Fox News on Saturday that China would continue to receive crude shipments from Venezuela, but did not provide details.\nWhat does this mean for the oil market? The events of this weekend are unlikely to have an immediate lasting impact on the price of crude oil or the cost motorists will pay at the pumps, according to experts at Third Bridge Energy, a US research company.\nVolatility is likely when oil trading resumes this week as traders weigh up the impact that a lifting of US sanctions against Venezuelan crude might have on the market against the instability caused by the regime change.\nIt will take longer for any meaningful increase in the barrels produced by Venezuela to dampen market prices. A return to the country’s crude production heyday at the turn of the century could take years, according to Peter McNally, the global lead analyst at Third Bridge.\n“Can Venezuela’s oil output recover?” McNally asked. “Our experts tell us the answer is yes but it will take tens of billions of dollars in investment and at least a decade of western oil majors committing to the country.”", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/04/venezuela-oil-industry-bust-what-role-could-the-us-play", "published_at": "2026-01-04T11:56:14+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Aria is publicly funded but independent from the government and directs research funding. Dalrymple is developing systems to safeguard AI’s use in critical infrastructure such as energy networks.\n“We can’t assume these systems are reliable. The science to do that is just not likely to materialise in time given the economic pressure. So the next best thing that we can do, which we may be able to do in time, is to control and mitigate the downsides,” he said.\nDescribing the consequences of technological progress getting ahead of safety as a “destabilisation of security and economy”, Dalrymple said more technical work was needed on understanding and controlling the behaviours of advanced AI systems.\n“Progress can be framed as destabilising and it could actually be good, which is what a lot of people at the frontier are hoping. I am working to try to make things go better but it’s very high risk and human civilisation is on the whole sleep walking into this transition.”\nThis month the UK government’s AI Security Institute (AISI) said the capabilities of advanced AI models were “improving rapidly” across all domains and the performance in some areas was doubling every eight months.\nLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year, according to the institute. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.\nThe institute also tested advanced models for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control. The tests showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.\nHowever, AISI stressed that a worst-case scenario was unlikely in a day-to-day environment, saying any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.\nDalrymple believes that AI systems will be able to automate the equivalent of a full day of research and development work by late 2026, which will “result in a further acceleration of capabilities”, because the technology will be able to self-improve on the maths and computer science elements of AI development.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/04/world-may-not-have-time-to-prepare-for-ai-safety-risks-says-leading-researcher", "published_at": "2026-01-04T14:00:08+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

The choice underlined the fact that while AI is being widely embraced, not least by corporate bosses keen to cut payroll costs, its downsides are also becoming obvious. In 2026, a reckoning with reality for AI represents a growing economic risk.\nEd Zitron, the foul-mouthed figurehead of AI scepticism, argues pretty convincingly that, as things stand, the “unit economics” of the entire industry – the cost of servicing the requests of a single customer against the price companies are able to charge them – just don’t add up. In typically colourful language, he calls them “dogshit”.\nRevenues from AI are rising rapidly as more paying clients sign up but so far not by enough to cover the wild levels of investment under way: $400bn (£297bn) in 2025, with much more forecast in the next 12 months.\nAnother vehement sceptic, Cory Doctorow, argues: “These companies are not profitable. They can’t be profitable. They keep the lights on by soaking up hundreds of billions of dollars in other people’s money and then lighting it on fire.”\nIt’s not new for frontier businesses to be loss-making, sometimes for years. But moving into profitability tends to happen as costs fall. Each iteration of large language models (LLMs) has so far tended to be more expensive, burning up more data, energy and highly paid tech experts’ time.\nThe vast datacentres required to train and run the models are so expensive to build and kit out that in many cases they are financed by debt, secured against future revenue.\nRecent analysis by Bloomberg suggested there had been $178.5bn of these datacentre credit deals in 2025 alone, with inexperienced new operators joining Wall Street firms in a “gold rush”.\nYet the precious Nvidia chips with which the datacentres are equipped have a limited shelf life, potentially shorter than that of the loan agreements.\nAs well as leverage – borrowing – the boom increasingly involves another bubble indicator: financial engineering, including the kinds of complex, circular funding arrangements that carry ominous echoes of past corporate crashes.\nBelieving generative AI will eventually produce enough revenue to match the colossal sums invested, relies – as in all bubbles – on telling big, dramatic stories about the scale of the transformation under way.\nSo LLMs are not just brilliant tools for analysing and synthesising large amounts of information. They’re fast approaching “superintelligence”, as OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, has it; or about to replace human friendships, according to Mark Zuckerberg.\nThey certainly do seem to be replacing some unfortunate human employees in specific sectors. Brian Merchant, the author of Blood in the Machine, which compares the backlash against big tech to the Luddite rebellion of the 19th century, has assembled scores of first-hand testimonies from writers, coders and marketers laid off in favour of AI-generated outputs.\nYet many of them highlight the bland quality of the work being produced by their digital replacements, or worse, the risks at play when sensitive tasks are shifted outside human control.\nIndeed, the dangers of charging headlong into replacing human workers wholesale have become increasingly apparent in recent months.\nIn the UK, the high court issued a warning about lawyers’ use of AI after two cases in which examples of completely fictitious case law were cited.\nPolice officers in Heber City, Utah, learned to manually check the work of a transcription tool they were using to draft write-ups from bodycam footage after it mistakenly claimed an officer had turned into a frog. Disney’s The Princess and the Frog was playing in the background.\nSpecific examples such as these fail to take into account the costs of what Merchant calls the “slop layer” of AI-generated content coursing through every online space, making it harder to identify what is real or true.\nDoctorow argues: “AI isn’t the bow-wave of ‘impending superintelligence’. Nor is it going to deliver ‘humanlike intelligence’. It’s a grab-bag of useful (sometimes very useful) tools that can sometimes make workers’ lives better, when workers get to decide how and when they’re used.”\nThought of in this way, these technologies may still have significant productivity benefits, but perhaps not quite significant enough to justify today’s toppy valuations and the tsunami of investment under way.\nAny rethink would cause chaos on financial markets. As the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) recently pointed out, the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks now account for 35% of the S&P500, up from 20% three years ago.\nA share price correction would have real-world consequences far beyond Silicon Valley, rippling out to hit retail investors on both sides of the Atlantic, Asian tech exporters and the lenders, including loosely regulated private equity firms, that bankrolled the sector’s expansion.\nIn the UK, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated in its budget forecasts, that a “global correction” scenario, in which UK and world stock prices fell 35% in the coming year, would knock 0.6% off the country’s GDP and cause a £16bn deterioration in the public finances.\nThat would be relatively manageable compared with the 2008 global financial crisis, in which UK institutions were leading players. But it would still be keenly felt in an economy struggling to find its feet.\nSo while it is perhaps understandable to anticipate a frisson of schadenfreude at the thought of big tech’s super-rich boss class being humbled, we’re all living in their world, and we would not escape the consequences.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/04/ai-reality-growing-economic-risk-2026", "published_at": "2026-01-04T12:18:32+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

And you want me to turn that off? The problem isn’t the internet, it’s the people. 1Eloise\nAccording to Google’s AI Overview: “Come and have a go if you think you’re hard enough.” EddieChorepost\nWithout Google Maps I would probably still be walking in circles in the middle of Epping Forest. 1AngryMan\nThanks to Google maps, I am walking in circles in the middle of Epping Forest!! Doomxsfsddgvhyt)\nI won’t be the first to point out what the internet has offered to disabled people. It’s a place where someone I know, who finds speaking nearly impossible due to physical challenges, can be fluent, authoritative and, most importantly, properly listened to at last. And that’s just one example. It’s not for me or anyone else to take that away. I actually hate web 2.0 with a passion and for any number of reasons, but I can’t refute this point, nor would I seek to. Asurea\nHonestly, without the internet I would be isolated and alone. I have a conservative family and am in the closet and queer and trans. With the internet my world finally expanded and I finally became free. I learned about myself and became happy and at peace. I met my most important person after a lifetime of difficulty connecting to people and I found things I loved that changed me. The internet has done a lot of harm, yes, but it’s not black and white and has been a lifeline for queer and disabled folk such as myself. I am so grateful for the connection and friendship I found thanks to the internet. Kati777\nThe internet itself is a magnificent technological achievement, not a moral failure. It has democratised access to knowledge, lowered barriers to publishing, connected marginal voices and transformed education, science and culture in ways that are hard to overstate.\nThe problem is not “the internet” so much as the concentration of power in a handful of social media platforms that algorithmically amplify outrage, misinformation and fringe belief while disclaiming responsibility for the consequences.\nMost of the damage could be addressed by treating these companies as accountable intermediaries rather than neutral pipes: enforcing transparency around amplification, meaningful liability for harm, and standards closer to those long applied to publishers and broadcasters.\nRolling back to landlines and letters would mean losing real, hard-won freedoms. The challenge is not to abandon the online world, but to civilise it. littlewaster\nPlease God yes. However nice and convenient it is to book a train ticket or transfer money from my bank account, none of it compensates for the breakdown in society which is occurring because of what is now a malignant online world. Kirsty McNally, by email\nI don’t know anybody who thinks society has improved in the last 30 years. I miss how fun and open-minded we used to be, and I miss being engaged with the real world, in all my time awake on this planet. Is there any chance of this actually happening? I hope so. Peter Rizzo, by email\nShould we turn radio off? Should we turn newspapers off? Should we turn the printing press off? And books? Should we turn off writing on paper and drawing on cave walls? These questions were probably all raised by someone, not very long after those respective inventions escaped the control of their inventors. Each time, the previous elite lost control to the masses over information and discourse, history keeps repeating. Randomusername222\nNo. We would miss that which is a deeply embedded and nearly indispensable need of humanity – connection. The internet allows us to quickly engage with other humans (around the planet!), which could be a lifesaver for those of us who cannot find community and acceptance in our immediate surroundings.\nIn being able to share our experiences we can galvanise opinion to push for change (I’m thinking of the murder of George Floyd and following outrage, and also that in an era before the internet, it was through the sharing of images of brutalised peaceful protesters for racial equality in the American south that the country was shamed into reform).\nThe internet enables sharing in a way unprecedented in human existence; it is this ability to join minds and hearts, sometimes across all known and artificial divisions that helps us find ourselves as individuals and communities, nations, and maybe one day as a planet. Henry Thorpe, by email\nThe internet is a communication medium, it is not the communication itself. Blaming “the internet” is like blaming the post office if you get a nasty letter. Turning off the internet would be like turning off mains electricity, or banning road transport other than horses.\nYou can’t turn the clock back. There was no long-lost golden age. DopFnord\nMy job in IT heavily depends on it. Outside my job, I’ve deleted all social media apps from my phone. It’s been quite a liberating experience. That whole realm has been hijacked and I find it worrying how many people use it as their primary source of news and information. Thankfully this paper seems to be one of the few places of resistance. AyJayEm\nObviously it’s far too late to put the genie back in the lamp (perhaps a more accurate metaphor would be to unwet the mogwai), but I often find myself wishing we could roll things back to just before the invention of the smartphone. That way, we’d still have most of the benefits of the internet, but it would be contained within a bulky device that lived in the corner of a room in our homes and on our desks at work. We’d be able to turn our backs on it whenever we left the house or office, and we wouldn’t be obliged to carry it with us all the time (I know in most cases we’re not “obliged” to carry smartphones with us, but it takes tremendous strength of will to swim against the tide all the time, not to mention how difficult many organisations make it to do things offline).\nTo me, that seems like a pretty good balance between enjoying the advantages of the internet while preserving those priceless and eminently human aspects of our lives that the internet has done a great deal to damage, if not outright destroyed. SignedUpToWriteThis\nThe best option is to use the internet in moderation and never to switch off your brain. willemijnheideman\nThere is nothing on the internet that does not leave a digital footprint. Governments could so simply make “social media” responsible for the accuracy of what they publish, in the same way that a newspaper is responsible. If they can be sued, they will control the crazy people spouting lies. Make them responsible. Sanction their owners. China and Russia control the internet. It can be done. CynicalGeorge\nIf anything, this article and comments has shown me that a huge amount of Guardian readers don’t know what the internet is or what aspects of modern life would be affected by “turning it off” (nearly everything, most likely from the power grid on up). unhelpful\nThe question poses “the internet” as both the root cause of that which ails modern society and as the antithesis of liberalism and human freedom. This is, of course, leading the witness. The internet is not designed to respect geographical borders. Its technology is not free of political bias, though having been devised in the US that bias is towards the modern western conceptions of freedom that the writer holds in such high regard.\nThe former GDR (East Germany) managed breathtaking levels of landline tapping and turning family members against one another. Conversations were frequently recorded. I do not see how a return to exclusively in-person contact, cassette tapes and landlines would intrinsically benefit those of us who value freedom.\nThe internet is designed to be flexible, scalable and open at distance. The openness that doesn’t respect traditional notions of borders is the same openness that allows states to use marvellous technologies against their own populations, because here’s what governments understand: people want to feel connected to one another, those connections can threaten the status quo, ergo those connections need to be coralled and controlled.\nPeople and organisations campaigning for freedom have long gathered and communicated using the internet, predating by many years the modern “walled gardens” of social media. Those voices are still here and there and everywhere. Perhaps, if you step away from the noise of everyone shouting into the void, you’ll be able to discern them talking about running the world in a different way. Dorkalicious\nI have mobility issues, yet I’ve managed to do all my Christmas present shopping without leaving the house. I designed our Christmas card and uploaded the image to have it printed.

The pharmacy will text me when it’s ready. We have several FaceTime sessions planned with family and friends around the world.\nI make a lot of use of the internet. It’s simply a question of using it wisely. snowybeach\nI was diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in the early 80s and it was an extremely isolating experience. I knew no one else with the condition and just had to deal with things very much alone. It’s so much better now for newly diagnosed children to be able to connect to others in a similar position. AucklandCanary\nPeople confuse the internet, which is a communication tool, with the various platforms, social media included, that use it. There are a lot of incredibly useful, practical things we do on the internet that benefit us. Not everything is a social media swamp, something we can choose to engage with, or not.\nThe internet is still in its infancy, so we’re at the proverbial wild west stage of its development with a host of crazies, carpetbaggers, extremists and entrepreneurs allowed pretty free rein, so it can be grim. Governments and political campaigners have both tried to exploit this “freedom” and also failed to manage it, partly because they don’t understand it, so it’s a bit of a cesspool.\nAdd the likes of all the tech bros, and it gets even worse.\nNot all bad though. Enshittification is now well recognised and people are getting pissed off with it. The days when everyone believed what they read are going fast, too, ironically hastened by the growth of AI slop and the likes of Trump and Musk. There’s more open criticism of such slop, and a lot more questioning of what’s the truth and what propaganda. The platforms are run by wealthy rightwingers but even now, much of the discussion is about obvious propaganda, fake AI-generated shopfronts and content. I believe social media has started to lose its attraction for many people, with people posting and engaging less.\nThe internet doesn’t need to be turned off, it just needs to be better managed and, on a personal level, used more carefully and responsibly. It needs to grow up. DJT1Million\nWe’re in the corporate capture stage of the internet, which is why the user interface for most people now consists of checking the same four apps over and over again, and posting the same content from one of them on to one or more of the other three.\nBeing online is no longer really enjoyable, it’s merely compulsive behaviour or compulsory for participating in society – and is frequently actively annoying and frustrating in proportion to what you get out of it.\nIn its first decade the possibilities of the internet seemed democratic and limitless. Now it’s just another plaything and control mechanism of the Oligarchy.\nFrank_Lynn\nFor many people in the world, the internet provides one of the few opportunities for girls to study. I imagine that would be missed. GUsername1\nI was about 32 when the internet became widely used, and I often struggle to recall how on earth I found things out. I read more actual books from cover to cover and my attention span was longer. I now struggle to focus for longer than a few minutes. I once used the phone a lot to book things, which meant having to speak to actual people more. Friends reunited was fairly innocent fun, but then Facebook was born, Snapchat, TikTok … . ChrisPook\nThere are conceptually simple enough solutions to the stink of the internet sewer. One is to forbid anonymity. All uploads to incorporate a source address.\nThe other would be an even greater boon – to tax ads. nosuchzone\nNo. But democracies will need to learn how to address misinformation to challenge the mobocracy. Besides, it still has so many positive and benign uses. As a musician, I would miss the ease with which new skills can be learned and ideas shared. I’m sure others will find reasons of their own for not wanting to turn the clock back. fender64\nMaybe a world internet-free day might be doable as a way of reflection on being too dependent on it. I will never forget that day in April in Spain when all the electricity went off and one couldn’t access the internet. People were much nicer to each other and helped one another out. You couldn’t access the news without a transistor radio and that wasn’t a bad thing. DaveTroll\nI’m sure I’ve read about surgeons who have to do something rare being able to get live expert guidance by video call. That’s potentially life-saving.Hummusexual\nMeta just suspended my Facebook account, probably for reporting too many hate groups. So I guess that means less internet for me. Tatrabant\nQuality of life was much better before the internet. People had time for each other, it was possible to understand and fix machines, and convenience was not dependent on accepting endless nastiness, fraud, and fascist adventuring as a fact of life.\nDigital processes are useful for research but have proved a disaster for human communication and now fuel criminality faster than the ability of law enforcement to contain them. Pull the plug and let us learn to live again. Elephantmoth\nIt was different, but whether it was better depended on circumstances. Those people around the world who now have access to some form of education thanks to internet access might disagree with [turning it off]. middle24\nWithout the internet, I’d not have my job (engineer), my bachelor’s and master’s degrees, would’ve found it much harder to find my apartment and roommate, and couldn’t do most of my shopping online so would need to take longer and more frequent trips just to shop since I’ve chosen a car-free lifestyle.\nBut I’m also only on one social network: Reddit, which allows me to read and interact with others about just the topics I select. I only enable notifications for things that actually matter on my phone. I’m also among the minority not staring down at my phone on a bus or train, partly because it gives me motion sickness. I also rarely wear headphones while out, due to preferring to tune into my environment or let my mind wander.\nSo I think the problem is not the internet itself but how we use it. Many fall into the trap of semi-passive consumption of media, allowing those on the other side of that content to disproportionally influence their ideas and behaviors. Were more people wise and kind in their usage of the internet, that’s what would make it better. fr33_th1nk3r\nAviation is so integrated with the internet that there would be chaos at airports. If you consider that shutting down aviation at the same time would be a good thing, just consider how much food comes in to the UK by air freight, and how much gets exported the same way (Scottish whisky and salmon). There’d be chaos. Socialismnow\nMake everyone use their real names online. You get a single email address and a single “internet-wide” user account. That will solve most of your problems right there. allanbabb (Replied to by BristolBoy: “Unless you are a dissident in, say, Russia or China, of course”, and by DauGiHyfryd: “I wonder if some of us will, in a year or two, be taken to task for our currently legal posts in the UK.”)\nMy answer is a resounding no. Although there are some areas of the internet which have become walled gardens of algorithms, AI slop and advertising, there are so many other areas where the spirit of the early internet lives on. One example is the “indieweb” where people amateurishly code their own websites, making public whatever content they want rather than staying within the bounds of media companies.\nThe rise of the ‘indieweb’ also includes the resurgence of the email newsletter (or RSS feed if you like). Instead of scrolling on infinite social media feeds, I get my brain going with some thoughtfully written blog posts in my inbox, introducing me to perspectives I would never have come across in the offline world. Long live the indieweb! accidentalusername\nYeah go on – let’s see what happens. More shops on the high street, more money spent locally. More social cohesion, interaction and tolerance? ForfrocksakesGibbons\nThe grass is always greener. As with all things, the key is balance. The internet is a tool. It’s up to us collectively to make the most out of the tools we have.

Turning off the internet is throwing the baby out with the bath water. krut\nThe ability to talk, easily, with friends who live around the world is very much a positive outcome from the internet.

And science papers – I would not like to go back to digging through a library. Lupe_ev\nYes! From 8pm to 8am every day. yogainspain\nThe vital change is to make the directors of social media firms personally responsible for the content of everything their algorithms place in people’s feeds.

Justdreaming\nWithout the internet I wouldn’t know that 5G mobile signals caused Covid-19. Corkerry\nThe internet has turned fringe belief into mainstream politics and policy – from authoritarianism to vaccines. No, that’s enabled by “the internet”, but it’s not what the internet “is”, or anywhere near everything networking is capable of. leadballoon\nA major issue with the internet in its current form is accountability. Anonymity and pseudonimity predominate and are exploited. You can’t tell the difference between a malign foreign actor and someone with a genuine grievance. Clickbait content is picked and amplified by the media giving it false weight. Frustratingly, the tools that ensure accountability and prevent anonymity have been around for over 20 years but technology companies have not implemented them. We are paying the price for the liberal and paranoid – albeit well-intentioned – philosophies on which the internet was founded which allow identity to be obfuscated. The ironic situation we now find ourselves means that criminals can communicate securely -using the said technologies- while keeping their identities secret. This wasn’t part of the plan but it could still be corrected. The question is, who is prepared to pick up the bill? ChrisGilbert\nI spend all Sunday alone in my flat. I quite like looking at daft cat pics on t’internet to cheer me up or phoning family and friends in another country using Messenger or WhatsApp. I’d be even more isolated than I am now without it. scouser58\nI have been steadily decreasing my time online and my life is becoming richer and quieter.

It sounds awful! huw1964\nIf we did, I’d miss sending and receiving emails, Wikipedia, Google images, masterpieces of world art, searching poems, song lyrics, immortal quotations and old movies, YouTube music, translating other languages into english, daily news, critics of rubbish and conspiracies, and Notes & Queries, which asks all the right questions. I would definitely not miss insolent and boastful social media, never-ending podcasts and smartphone selfies. RPOrlando, by email\nIf the internet were to crash permanently tomorrow, I wouldn’t be upset. I may be an old fart but to me the pre internet days were better. It was so nice when you could look up someone’s number in a phone book and give them a call and they would actually answer. That doesn’t happen any more. Now if you want to talk to someone you have to have the inside scoop on their number and then send them a text to tell them that at such and such time you will be giving them a call and then, just maybe, they will actually answer. This isn’t progress, this is just plain weird.\nI’m a senior and it would be unwise to just run off to a cabin in the woods but honestly, I might as well be a hermit in the woods with how the world has become. I’m fed up with how things are and where we seem to be heading. Things aren’t improving, they are getting worse and the internet is largely to blame. TimMcGiffin, by email\nYes! I speak as a child of the 90s, in my view everything was better back then and it got worse down to many factors but the biggest one would be the internet.

Sam McGregor, Bideford, Devon\nIf the internet were shut off tomorrow, there might be more jobs, more friction, more gatekeepers. But the snake oil salesmen would remain.

An investigation later showed that Ramos was obsessed with violence and notoriety in the months leading up to the attack.\nGonzales and former Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo were among the first on the scene, and they are the only two officers to face criminal charges over the slow response. Arredondo's trial has not yet been scheduled.\nThe charges against Gonzales carry up to two years in prison if he is convicted. The trial, which is expected to last up to three weeks, begins with jury selection.\nGonzales pleaded not guilty. His attorney has said Gonzales tried to save children that day.\nPolice and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott initially said swift law enforcement action killed Ramos and saved lives. But that version quickly unraveled as families described begging police to go into the building and 911 calls emerged from students pleading for help.\nThe indictment alleges Gonzales placed children in \"imminent danger\" of injury or death by failing to engage, distract or delay the shooter and by not following his active shooter training. The allegations also say he did not advance toward the gunfire despite hearing shots and being told where the shooter was.\nState and federal reviews of the shooting cited cascading problems in law enforcement training, communication, leadership and technology, and questioned why officers waited so long.\nAccording to the state review, Gonzales told investigators that once police realized there were students still sitting in other classrooms, he helped evacuate them.\nSome family members of the victims have said more officers should be indicted.\n\"They all waited and allowed children and teachers to die,\" said Velma Lisa Duran, whose sister Irma Garcia was one of the two teachers who were killed.\nProsecutors will likely face a high bar to win a conviction. Juries are often reluctant to convict law enforcement officers for inaction, as seen after the Parkland, Florida, school massacre in 2018.\nSheriff's deputy Scot Peterson was charged with failing to confront the shooter in that attack. It was the first such prosecution in the U.S. for an on-campus shooting, and Peterson was acquitted by a jury in 2023.\nAt the request of Gonzales' attorneys, the trial was moved about 200 miles (320 kilometers) southeast to Corpus Christi. They argued Gonzales could not receive a fair trial in Uvalde, and prosecutors did not object.\nUvalde, a town of 15,000, still has several prominent reminders of the shooting. Robb Elementary is closed but still stands, and a memorial of 21 crosses and flower sits near the school sign. Another memorial sits at the downtown plaza fountain, and murals depicting several victims can still be seen on the walls of several buildings.\nJesse Rizo, whose 9-year-old niece Jackie was one of the students killed, said even with three-hour drive to Corpus Christi, the family would like to have someone attend the trial every day.\n\"It's important that the jury see that Jackie had a big, strong family,\" Rizo said.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2026/01/05/g-s1-104497/trial-officer-accused-failing-to-protect-uvalde", "published_at": "2026-01-05T03:12:15-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Kristi Noem on Sunday, when asked about Higgins' statement, defended the administration ending the program, saying that decisions are made in collaboration with the State Department and White House.\n\"Every individual that was under TPS has the opportunity to apply for refugee status and that evaluation will go forward, but we need to make sure that our programs actually mean something and that we are following the law,\" Noem said during an interview with Fox News.\nThe Department of Homeland Security also said in a social media post later on Sunday: \"Secretary Noem ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 500,000 Venezuelans and now they can go home to a country that they love.\"\nAt least 7.9 million people have fled Venezuela's humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2026/01/04/nx-s1-5666340/venezuela-nicolas-maduro-venezuelans-asylum-seekers-refugee", "published_at": "2026-01-04T18:33:13-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Multiple administrations have seen the region through the lens of the Monroe Doctrine. That's a doctrine that establishes the U.S. as the dominant world power in the region. So how do yesterday's events in Venezuela fit in with this history? We're joined now by Eduardo Gamarra. He's a professor of politics and international relations at Florida International University. Good morning.\nEDUARDO GAMARRA: Good morning. Thank you for having me.\nRASCOE: The U.S. isn't new to interfering in Latin America, but the capture and removal of a sitting president, like we saw yesterday, it seems to be one of the most aggressive and overt examples of U.S. interference. Like, what is your reaction?\nGAMARRA: Well, it's certainly a different kind of intervention. I guess the only parallel is Manuel Antonio Noriega in 1989. However, the clear difference is that we're not recognizing Maduro as the president of Venezuela. We're calling him a narcotrafficking terrorist. But at the same time, we're recognizing now, as the legitimate transitional president of Venezuela, we're recognizing Delcy Rodríguez, the vice president. So we have an interesting contradiction there. If the president was illegitimate, what makes the vice president legitimate and the person who is going to continue?\nRASCOE: Well, President Trump said yesterday, the U.S. will run Venezuela until a transition of power can take place. Is there any historical precedent for that? And is that even possible, given that the U.S. right now doesn't have a military or diplomatic presence inside Venezuela?\nGAMARRA: Well, correct. And perhaps, you know, it's important to go back about a hundred years when the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine was in place. The United States invaded Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, invaded Haiti. It also essentially ran Cuba. But in each of those cases, there was a U.S. military occupation of those countries. In this case, it's very interesting because there is no military presence, although the president told us yesterday that there could be an additional military intervention if things don't go the way he foresees them. But at the moment, we are essentially relying on this vice president and essentially the same regime. So in this sense, there was no real regime change in Venezuela because we're relying on Delcy Rodríguez and the whole crew that has, in fact, been running Venezuela with Maduro for the last decade.\nRASCOE: When you look at the overall history of U.S. involvement in Latin America, how do you assess the results, both for U.S. interests and for the people of Latin America who ultimately live with the consequences of the U.S. actions?\nGAMARRA: Well, you know, it's interesting because over the last two decades, most of us, analysts in particular, were often complaining about the lack of attention that the United States was giving to Latin America. Except for the war on drugs, except for the very strong bonds with Colombia, for example - right? - the U.S. was largely absent in the region. The focus was elsewhere. But this administration has not only redefined the Monroe Doctrine under now the Trump corollary, but is essentially saying that we - that this is the key area of interest for - to the United States. And this aligns with a shift toward the right of many countries in Latin America through electoral processes - Milei in Argentina, Kast in Chile, etc., right?\nRASCOE: Do you think that's good or bad?\nGAMARRA: It's complicated, and the value judgment at this stage is difficult because we don't know what the results will be. What, to me, is striking about Venezuela is that, in fact, there has been no regime change, and our interests are largely driven by the interests of the oil companies that the president has been largely supportive of.\nRASCOE: That's Eduardo Gamarra from Florida International University.

Here are the ones that stood up to science, and those that were mostly hype.", "content": "Wellness trends worth taking into the new year (and some that aren't)\nTrying to keep up with the flood of wellness trends last year was bewildering. Influencers promoted seemingly endless products and experiences under the banner of \"wellness.\" Some trends, like celery juicing, cold plunges and protein bars have been around for a few years now. But other trends that came across our radar in 2025 had more of an \"old is new again\" energy, like embracing full-fat dairy and cooking with beef tallow.\nAt NPR's science desk, we did our best to pick apart what's healthy and what's hype. Here are seven of the trends NPR reported on, and what the data and experts had to say about them.\nThis story originally ran in NPR's Health newsletter. Want the latest stories on the science of healthy living? Subscribe here.\nTrend: A return to full-fat dairy\nFor decades, public health messaging warned against high-fat dairy. But the argument against it is largely \"circumstantial,\" says Benoit LaMarche, a Canadian food scientist who headed up an evidence review of the relationship between dairy and heart disease risk, published in May.\nThe review concluded that generally speaking, fat-free, low-fat and full-fat dairy products had the same effects. Some studies have even shown the benefits of higher-fat over lower-fat dairy. For instance, one study that followed 18 adults for three weeks found drinking whole milk actually outperformed skim milk when it comes to raising HDL, or \"good\" cholesterol.\nMoreover, experts are saying that worrying about the fat content in dairy is essentially a distraction from bigger dietary concerns like eating foods with too much salt, refined carbs and sugar.\nThe topic's on the radar since Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promised to end the \"attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt.\" It's also increasingly popular online among those participating in the TikTok-driven \"cottage cheese comeback.\"\nBottom line: Not the worst idea. Read the full story.\nTrend: Wearing a weighted vest while taking your daily walk\nIs striding around in an uncomfortably heavy vest a great workout that marries strengthening, weight loss, and cardio with fresh air and sunshine — or are wearers merely projecting a fitness-y image to their neighbors?\nWeighted vests are often marketed to women in their 40s, looking to increase muscle and bone growth to mitigate the effects of decreasing estrogen. But the evidence that wearing them works for that is particularly scant.\nOne small study compared people walking with weighted vests with those who walked without them and found no significant difference in bone health. Another study did find some benefits for people who wore weighted vests while engaging in resistance workouts, but the study doesn't make clear whether the vests or the exercises were the cause of healthy bone growth.\nIf you want a science-backed way to build muscle or replace bone density lost during perimenopause and menopause, experts like exercise scientist Lauren Colenso-Semple recommend resistance training.\nWeighted vests may have some benefits for cardiovascular health, says Roger Fielding, who studies exercise science at Tufts University. Plus walking the same distance with more weight will burn more calories. (Just don't expect us to do choreo, ok?!)\nBottom line: Won't hurt but there are better ways to build muscle. Read the full story.\nTrend: Scientifically tracking your blood sugar, even if you don't have diabetes\nMotivation is a tricky business for people looking to get leaner or eat healthier. The reward of fitting into a dress for a wedding that's months away, or logging lower blood sugar at your next physical is uncertain and remote – but that rum cake will provide the jolt of satisfaction you crave right now. So could real-time data shift the calculus?\nThat's the promise behind wearing a continuous glucose monitor, or CGM, a small device that sticks to the back of the arm. Every few minutes it sends a signal to your phone estimating the concentration of sugar in your blood. The tech has been a game-changer for some people with diabetes, providing a more user-friendly alternative to finger prick tests.\nFor people without diabetes, the theory is, a wearable glucose monitor can show you which snacks or meals make your blood sugar spike too high, and you can modify your diet accordingly.\nAccording to the research, CGMs have helped some people lower their blood sugar or lose weight – others not so much.\nThere was a lot of personal variation in the results of two recent studies, says Collin Popp, a researcher at NYU Grossman School of Medicine who helped lead one of the studies. \"We had individuals coming back and saying, 'You changed my life. I lost 30 pounds and I feel great.' Other people in the study put on weight,\" he says.\nIf you try a CGM, you may want to take the data with a grain of salt. One recent study found that the same meal eaten on two different days gave very different readings. Another small study found that the continuous glucose monitor overestimated people's blood sugar levels compared with measuring it in a blood test.\nBottom line: Continuous glucose monitors can be helpful, but take them with a grain of salt. Read the full story.\nTrend: Drinking a bright blue dye\nHere's a weird one. Wellness influencers have been singing the praises of a synthetic dye that stains their tongues blue, and they claim it offers a host of benefits. Methylene blue dye is far from new. Formulated as a textile dye in the 19th century, it's since been prescribed as a treatment for malaria, cyanide poisoning, and methemoglobinemia, a rare blood disorder.\nBiohackers claim that methylene blue improves the function of the cells' mitochondria, thereby slowing aging, improving mood and cognition, among other benefits.\nStudies in rodents have shown methylene blue does improve mitochondrial function and reduce inflammation. But in preliminary human studies, the results haven't shown significant benefit in healthy people, says Lorne Hofseth, a researcher at the University of South Carolina College of Pharmacy.\nAnd there's risks, including serotonin toxicity – a drug reaction that can cause elevated blood pressure, diarrhea, seizures, and even death. And like other supplements, methylene dye isn't tested for safety before it goes to market. It can be hard to know what you're really getting.\nBottom line: You're probably turning your tongue blue for no reason. Read the full story.\nTrend: More protein in everything … even your Oreos!\nIf you want protein on the go, you don't have to look far. Grocery and convenience store shelves are lined with bars, cookies, brownies and other snack foods with \"high protein\" printed on the label.\nBut how do you suss out marketing from fact? It turns out there's no particular metric manufacturers need to meet in order to advertise a product as \"high protein.\" For instance, a candy with 1 gram of protein may have a high-protein marketing claim on the front of the package, which admittedly is a lot more than most candy, says physiologist Stefan Pasiakos, but clearly doesn't make it healthy.\nOne quick rule of thumb to assess protein claims is to check the percentage of the daily value of protein on the nutrition facts label on the package. Anything 20% or above can be seen as high protein, according to the FDA.\nAnd even if they are high protein, packaged snacks can also be high in calories, sugar, or processed ingredients. You'll do better to get protein from whole foods like yogurt or during meals, say nutritionists.\nThat being said, protein snacks can be a convenient way to reduce muscle soreness after a workout.\nBottom line: Junk food is still not a good choice, even with protein added. Read the full story.\nTrend: Beef fat is back, baby! For cooking (and skincare?!)\nThis March, Health Secretary Kennedy sat down at a fast food burger joint with Fox News host Sean Hannity, to talk about obesity and metabolic disease. The two were at a Steak N' Shake in honor of the chain's switch from vegetable oil to tallow, or rendered beef fat, to cook French fries.\nTallow was phased out of fast food chains decades ago, but Kennedy says it's a healthier alternative to seed oils (aka vegetable oils), which he claimed in a post on X are \"one of the driving forces of the obesity epidemic.\"\nSo are fries cooked in beef tallow any healthier?\n\"People should eat fewer French fries, whatever they're deep fried in,\" says nutrition scientist Christopher Gardner.\nBeef tallow and other saturated fats can lead to clogged arteries and high blood pressure, he notes. And as a threat to health, seed oils have been unfairly villainized, says cardiologist. Dariush Mozaffarian, at Tufts University.\nThe real health villains in junk food are excessive amounts of refined grains, starches, and sugars, as well as salt and other preservatives, chemical additives, he says.\nMeanwhile skincare products made from beef tallow are trending this year, too. It's all part of a cultural moment where people are skeptical of synthetic ingredients, says Jennifer Reich, a sociologist at the University of Colorado Denver. As a sort of shortcut to healthier choices, Reich says people opt for things like beef tallow that seem natural because it ostensibly comes from a farm instead of an overseas factory supply chain. Yet for some users, they can make skin problems like acne worse.\nBottom line: Not so fast. Read the full story on cooking with tallow.\nTrend: Creatine supplements are everything\nWellness influencer Bobby Parish declared creatine the \"supplement of the year\" for 2025 in a promotional TikTok post. It's a compound made from three amino acids that your muscles use as a source of energy. Long a favorite of body-building gym bros, it's another product that enthusiasts now credit with multiple benefits, including brain function and regulating blood sugar.\nThe evidence still isn't strong for those two claims, but when it comes to adding lean muscle mass, the evidence for creatine supplements is \"overwhelming,\" says Jose Antonio, a professor of exercise and sports science at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. It can also help provide energy to keep at your workout longer.\nBut one big caveat here: Taking supplements isn't enough to see strength gains – you actually have to get your butt to the gym and work out. A review of 35 studies found that when creatine supplements were combined with resistance training, adult men added around 2 to 3 pounds of lean body mass.\nFor safety precautions and some basic guidance on how to dose if you'd like to try creatine, check out the report by NPR's Maria Godoy.\nBottom line: These might actually be pretty helpful, but don't skip the gym.

Look, if you protested peacefully on January 6th, and you had Merrick Garland’s Department of Justice treat you like a gang member, you should be pardoned,” Vance said. “If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned. And there’s a little bit of a gray area there.”\nBut as one of his first acts in office, Trump issued mass pardons to Jan. 6 defendants. Only 14 defendants — all of whom were linked to extremist groups — received commutations rather than a full pardon, meaning they were released from prison, but the convictions remained on their records.\nTrump’s pardon also included defendants who had prior criminal records for crimes including sexual assault, manslaughter and rape.\nThe administration subsequently deleted a government database of Jan. 6 cases, and evidence began disappearing from a site maintained to share court exhibits with the media.\nNPR joined a coalition of media organizations that went to federal court to preserve access to video evidence from the Jan. 6 cases. Hundreds of those videos are now publicly accessible through NPR’s database of all of the prosecutions.\nOn June 6, 2025, the Trump administration settled a lawsuit brought by Ashli Babbitt’s family for $4.975 million. Later that year, on Nov. 7, Trump granted a sweeping pardon to “all United States citizens…for any conduct relating to their efforts to expose voting fraud and vulnerabilities in the 2020 Presidential Election.” The immediate effect of that pardon, which applies to federal charges, was largely symbolic.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2026/01/04/g-s1-102891/jan-6-archive", "published_at": "2026-01-04T05:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

But big differences abound.", "content": "A tale of two U.S. interventions and why Venezuela is not Panama 2.0\nWASHINGTON — It is a case of geopolitical déjà vu. On the same day thirty-six years apart, U.S. forces seized a deeply unpopular, Latin American dictator and brought him to the United States to face drug charges.\nIn 1990, soldiers sent by President George H.W. Bush detained Panamanian President Manuel Noriega. On Saturday, it was troops sent by President Trump who captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\nIn both instances, analysts said the United States was using force to secure strategic assets in the Western hemisphere, namely the Panama Canal and Venezuela's oil fields.\n\"We'll be selling oil,\" President Trump said at a news conference Saturday, \"probably in much larger doses because they couldn't produce very much because their infrastructure was so bad.\"\nDespite some similarities, analysts and former diplomats also see big differences between the interventions in Panama and Venezuela and worry about where the latter could be headed.\nPanama is widely seen as a bright spot in a history of U.S. operations in Latin America that have included CIA-backed coups in Guatemala and Chile. John Feeley, a career diplomat who served as U.S. ambassador to Panama during the second Obama administration, said the U.S. invasion in 1989 had a positive impact on the country.\n\"The major result was a democratic system with self-determination, peaceful transfer of governance, and an economy that actually took off and did very, very well,\" said Feeley.\nOne reason the Panama operation worked, said Feeley, is because a political opposition there was ready to take over and American troops — thousands of whom were already stationed in the canal zone — were quickly in and out of Panama-proper.\nBy contrast, President Trump declared the United States would \"run\" Venezuela for now in advance of what he called a \"safe, proper and judicious transition.\" Trump said Venezuela's Vice-President, Delcy Rodríguez, had been sworn in as the new president.\n\"She's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,\" Trump told reporters.\nBut speaking to Venezuelans in a televised address, Rodríguez pushed back against Trump, saying what the U.S. had done to her homeland was \"a barbarity.\"\nTrump seemed to dismiss the notion that Venezuelan opposition leader and 2025 Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado could lead the country, saying she didn't have enough support or respect inside Venezuela.\nFeeley called Trump's statement about Machado the \"saddest\" of his press conference.\n\"Maduro is not even remotely popular, and he stole the (2024) election,\" said Feeley, \"so there seems to be popular will to get rid of him. What there does not seem to be, in my view so far, is any kind of transition plan.\"\nThe failure to map out a transition so far also worries Douglas Farah, the president of IBI Consultants who spent a decade advising the Pentagon. In 2019, Farah worked with Trump administration officials running war games to determine what a post-Maduro Venezuela might look like. The group looked at several scenarios.\n\"The conclusion of every one was that unless you had some sort of managed transition from the regime to a democratic or some semi-functional democratic system, you would have absolute chaos for a long period of time,\" Farah said.\nThat risks a power vacuum that Farah said various armed groups — including guerillas from Colombia — would swiftly move to fill, leading to more violence.\nDuring his news conference, President Trump declined to rule out deploying American troops to Venezuelan soil.\n\"We're not afraid of boots on the ground,\" the president told reporters.\nBut Farah said occupying Venezuela would be far more difficult than the intervention in Panama. Venezuela has seven times as many people and a land mass twelve times larger.\n\"In Venezuela, you have mountains, you have jungles, you have ocean fronts,\" Farah said. \"How do we talk about taking over a country when we have no functional presence there?\"", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2026/01/04/nx-s1-5665800/u-s-interventions-venezuela-panama", "published_at": "2026-01-04T05:00:00-05:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Today, we're learning more about what the Trump administration means by running that country. And on Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats drew their party lines on this operation. With more on the unfolding politics of this attack, we turn to NPR's Luke Garrett. Welcome.\nLUKE GARRETT, BYLINE: Hello, Lauren.\nFRAYER: Luke, a day has passed since Trump told the world that his administration will run Venezuela after it captured President Nicolas Maduro. What do we know about what that means?\nGARRETT: That is the question. And today, Secretary of State Marco Rubio answered it in part. Here's Rubio on NBC News.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\")\nMARCO RUBIO: He's not running the - he's running policy, the policy with regard to this. We want Venezuela to move in a certain direction.\nGARRETT: Rubio said no U.S. troops are currently in Venezuela, but the U.S. will influence the country through oil sanction enforcement.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\")\nRUBIO: Our military is helping the Coast Guard conduct a law enforcement function, which is not just the capture of Maduro but the enforcement of our sanctions. We go to court. We get a warrant. We seize the boats.\nGARRETT: The secretary of state said U.S. naval, quote, \"oil quarantine\" remains just off the country's coast. So in short, Lauren, Rubio is saying that the U.S. will run Venezuela but at arm's length for now.\nFRAYER: And yet, yesterday, Trump did not rule out sending U.S. troops to Venezuela. Has anything changed there?\nGARRETT: No. This hasn't changed. Rubio said today that Trump will - still has this option to send in U.S. troops. For now, though, the administration and its allies in Congress are hoping to influence Maduro allies who are still running the country, namely interim President Delcy Rodriguez. Here's chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton, on CNN calling out Rodriguez specifically.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"STATE OF THE UNION WITH JAKE TAPPER AND DANA BASH\")\nTOM COTTON: It is a fact that she and other indicted and sanctioned officials are in Venezuela. They have control of the military and security services. We have to deal with that fact.\nGARRETT: And yesterday, Trump said Rodriguez would cooperate. But during an interview with The Atlantic magazine today, Trump threatened Rodriguez saying she would pay a, quote, \"very big price\" if she did not do what was right. So that's something to watch.\nFRAYER: What about the legality of all this? What legal justification are we hearing from the White House?\nGARRETT: So both Rubio and Cotton called the capture of Maduro and his wife an arrest that was simply aided by the military. Because of that, they argue this didn't require congressional notification, but Democrats disagree. Here's Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on ABC News.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THIS WEEK\")\nCHUCK SCHUMER: They went inside Venezuela, bombed civilian as well as military places. And it's a violation of the law to do what they did without getting the authorization of Congress.\nGARRETT: Schumer said a war powers resolution will get a vote this week, and if it passes, Schumer said Trump won't be able to launch another attack without congressional approval. Though it's worth noting here, Lauren, Democrats have forced similar votes in the past. All have failed.\nFRAYER: So what about international reaction? All of this is going to play out at the United Nations, no?\nGARRETT: Right. Colombia asked for and was granted an emergency U.N. meeting tomorrow morning. In a statement, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was, quote, \"deeply alarmed\" by the U.S. attack. But U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Mike Waltz, offered his preamble to his defense of Trump's actions on Fox News.\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES WITH MARIA BARTIROMO\")\nMIKE WALTZ: You're going to hear a lot of hand-wringing on Article 2 of the U.N. Charter, which deals with sovereignty. And, you know, I will remind everyone of Article 51.\nGARRETT: Now, Article 51 of the U.N. Charter protects a country's right to self-defense. The White House has long argued that its military action against Venezuela and its drug trafficking constitutes self-defense.\nFRAYER: So many questions, Luke, what are you looking for this week?\nGARRETT: For starters, that U.N. meeting tomorrow. I'll also have my eyes on the Senate. You know, will they pass this war powers resolution? We'll be looking at that.\nFRAYER: Thanks so much, Luke.\nGARRETT: You bet.\nCopyright © 2026 NPR.

Here's how that might go\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe speaks to Ambassador Fredrick Barton, now a lecturer at Princeton University, about the challenges of U.S. nation-building in countries such as Venezuela.\nAYESHA RASCOE, HOST:\nAs we were hearing, President Trump talked a lot yesterday about things that essentially amount to nation-building in Venezuela. But is there a clear path to success for that endeavor, particularly after months of intimidation and a forced regime change? Ambassador Frederick Barton was the first assistant secretary of state for conflict and stabilization operations during President Obama's administration. He's also a lecturer at Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs, and he joins us now. Welcome to the program.\nFREDERICK BARTON: Thanks so much, Ayesha.\nRASCOE: Given all of your experience, can you see the U.S. succeeding in its stated mission in Venezuela?\nBARTON: It's going to be tough. I mean, in a way, they've done the easiest piece already, and we've seen that over and over again. These are huge tasks, a country of about 30 million people, twice the size of Iraq. We haven't really been in the country in the way we should be to know it before we get into it. We have not engaged the American public. There are obvious questions of illegality that need to be - that will be addressed. The global imprint of this action is questionable. So the entry point really matters, and the entry was the most planned out part of this whole process. It's doubtful that the planning has gone over into this next stage.\nRASCOE: President Trump says the U.S. will be running Venezuela. And obviously, we don't know exactly what that means. Is that assurance that the U.S. will be running Venezuela on top of a potential U.S. military occupation - is that seen as reassuring to the local population in these situations, as they try to form their new government?\nBARTON: Well, I suspect there's some hopefulness there. I mean, there was clearly fatigue with Maduro. The destruction of the country had been quite thorough over the last couple of decades. The sanctions and other restrictions have really toughened life there. Many, many, many Venezuelans are living in the United States, either by choice or because they had no other choice. So the conditions in or outside the country - a huge part of their population is millions of people outside of the country. So all - those all leave you with a feeling that the Venezuelans clearly were ready for something else. But to do it this way takes on a burden that we're not particularly good at. And to complicate matters, this administration has gotten rid of all the people and all the offices that had any expertise in this area.\nRASCOE: Well, I wanted to ask you about that because, you know, the Trump administration has made major cuts to USAID agencies and their programs. So as it stands, do you have the relevant departments and agencies in a position to facilitate this development and rebuilding?\nBARTON: Not really. And that's a huge complication because the normal course of diplomacy is to talk to the leadership, to assume that there's a degree of stability or to go in there in emergency discussions. And what we're talking about is flooding the zone. So it leads me to believe that President Trump, who really seems to call most of the signals here, is going to go for some kind of a hybrid model, which would be the only path forward but still a very, very narrow path for success.\nRASCOE: So President Trump mentioned Venezuela's considerable oil reserves several times, essentially saying that the country's own oil will pay for its rebuilding. Is that realistic?\nBARTON: Well, it proved to be completely false in Iraq, which was pumping a lot more oil than Venezuela is. Now, Venezuela has capacity that's not being used now because of deterioration and sanctions and other reasons. So it's possible. And oil companies have worked in places that they don't particularly like. Nigeria - Shell tried to get out eventually. Chevron's obviously been here.\nRASCOE: Chevron's been in Venezuela. Yeah.\nBARTON: Been in Venezuela. Angola has had a long-standing kind of oil zone, a safe zone. But this - so the hybrid would look like oil, plus maybe a deal with the existing leadership, and we pay off the military and the police so they maintain order 'cause that's the very first issue.\nRASCOE: That's Ambassador Frederick Barton. Thank you so much for speaking with us today.\nBARTON: Hey, my pleasure. Thank you.\nCopyright © 2026 NPR. All rights reserved.

The Trump administration froze federal funding last week that was meant to help low-income families pay for child care. The suspension came after a viral video claimed without evidence that there is widespread fraud in Minnesota day care centers run by Somali Americans. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has acknowledged fraud is a serious problem in the state, but he said that this particular issue has been politicized.\nTo find out more about how that freeze is affecting providers, we turn to Maria Snider. She's the vice president of the Minnesota Child Care Association, an advocacy group, and director of a child care center in St. Paul. Welcome to the program.\nMARIA SNIDER: Hello. Thank you so much for having me.\nRASCOE: So how is this freeze in federal funding affecting the center that you operate?\nSNIDER: Well, my center is about - a little over half of the students are accessing child care assistance in order to attend. And there's a lot of fear and worry from parents, who are just really baffled as to how this could be happening. One mom said to me yesterday, there's no fraud here. I'm working hard every day. And I honestly am a little at a loss for how to respond because I know that to be true as well. And so we're really hoping that there can be some kind of course correction here where funding can continue for hardworking families who really need the services.\nRASCOE: Well, what does this mean for those families whose kids are in centers that receive these funds? So they're not able to pay for daycare centers right now?\nSNIDER: Yeah. So it's really hard to say how it will play out. We're used to getting paid about three weeks after we deliver services, so we have a little bit of time before we know the full impact. But if parents can't access child care assistance to pay tuition, then those children will not be able to attend child care, which would mean that their parents can't go to work. A lot of families are living paycheck to paycheck. You know, one paycheck can mean they can't make their rent payment. They can become homeless very quickly. It's a really scary situation.\nAnd it's also really scary for providers because that can mean job loss. It can mean having to close down classrooms or entire programs. And it can really have a reaching effect not just on children who are accessing child care assistance, but on the children and families who attend programs where that's part of the funding structure. Because of how child care operates, if even, you know, 10% or 20% of your income goes away, that can mean closing down a classroom. That can mean closing down a program. So I think the impacts of this are going to be extremely widely felt. Just from working with providers over the years across the state, most people do accept child care assistance, and that is part of their program structure.\nRASCOE: Would your child care center be able to survive without these subsidies?\nSNIDER: Right now 33 of the 51 children are on child care assistance. If those funds were to stop, I don't know how long we can continue operations. We would certainly be looking at closing down classrooms, potentially laying off employees. That's over half of our enrolled students.\nRASCOE: As I mentioned, federal officials are citing these allegations of fraud in child care to explain the funding pause, and they're pointing specifically to Minnesota. We should mention there is some history here. There was a big pandemic relief fraud scandal in the state. But what do you make of these recent claims about fraud in child care?\nSNIDER: I want all funding that's meant to go to children to go to children. There are wait lists for child care assistance programs in our state, so it's really important that these funds are used and used well. Anyone that is committing fraud should most certainly be held accountable and should not be able to continue operations and continue receiving public funds. It just seems so intensely cruel and unfair to be pulling the rug out from thousands of families and child care providers for the potential bad actions of a few.\nRASCOE: The Trump administration is requesting more data and verification before funding returns. Do you have any sense of when that might happen in Minnesota? Have you talked to officials there? Are they providing this data and verification?\nSNIDER: We received an email from the state. I believe it was a mass communication to all child care providers on January 2, saying what the additional information is that's being required. As far as I can tell, the things that were in the email were things like our license numbers and our full names and addresses, which the state already has, of course. That's how we're licensed to operate here. Honestly, your guess is as good as mine what else they would want, because my experience with this program is that it already requires a really high level of documentation to prove the services that are being provided.\nRASCOE: Ultimately, when do you hope to see this resolved? You said you have about three weeks before you start seeing the impacts. If you don't get that payment in three weeks, what would be the next steps? Like, is there a deadline for when this will have - like, start having real impact on these children in Minnesota and elsewhere?\nSNIDER: So I'm not a state or government official, so I don't want to speak with too much authority on it. What I saw in the email from the state is that it's due by January 9, and then we'll see, I guess, if the federal government accepts that or not. If they don't and if child care assistance is really cut off, that's going to be devastating. It's going to mean people are going to lose their jobs - parents, early childhood teachers. Programs might be at risk of closing because of the crisis that's been in child care for decades. It's an underfunded industry, so something like this is just really like kicking us when we're down.\nRASCOE: That's Maria Snider, vice president of the Minnesota Child Care Association. Thank you so much for joining us.\nSNIDER: Thank you so much.\nCopyright © 2026 NPR. All rights reserved.

One of those people is Helena Carpio. She's a journalist and lives in Caracas, about a mile from one of the airbases struck on Saturday.\nHELENA CARPIO: So I couldn't sleep that night, and I was awake. And all of a sudden, I heard the windows trembling so hard that I thought it was an earthquake.\nFRAYER: She quickly realized what was happening.\nCARPIO: After the third explosion, something else was up. And to be honest, I think many Venezuelans have had U.S. intervention of some sort or form in the back of their minds for months.\nFRAYER: President Trump announced Maduro's capture hours later on social media. Carpio's window was open when the news came.\nCARPIO: All of a sudden, I hear this burst of sound, and it was screaming combined with cheering, combined with caceroleando, which is this traditional way of protesting the Maduro government where you grab your pots and pans from the kitchen, and you hit them really hard with, like, wooden spoons and other utensils. And then 10 minutes after that, it went quiet, and it remained quiet for the rest of the day.\nFRAYER: The shock, and for some, excitement after the strike didn't last long. Carpio said she's turned her attention to the most pressing topic - survival. There are power outages in some parts of Caracas. She'll need gas.\nCARPIO: Fuel - fuel is a huge concern. Are there going to be any pumps open? Will you be able to find any fuel? Will you have to queue five, six hours to get it?\nFRAYER: And food.\nCARPIO: Yesterday, I queued for seven hours at a supermarket for food. It was quite an apocalyptic scene, to be honest. Like, eggs were all over the floor. Certain racks where, like, nonperishables are were, like, empty. No one went to work at the supermarket that day. So there were - out of 20 cashiers, there were only three open.\nFRAYER: Outside the capital, Venezuelans share those same concerns. Fabbiana Lamboglia is an energy analyst. She lives in Maracaibo, well west of Caracas. She was awake when the attack happened.\nFABBIANA LAMBOGLIA: I just was talking with some friends that live in the capital, and they start like, OK, I'm hearing airplanes, I'm hearing bombs, I'm hearing strikes. And of course, I was very nervous about the situation.\nFRAYER: In her city, the traffic lights are working. She has power, but that doesn't mean things feel safe.\nLAMBOGLIA: To be honest, I am not going out if it's not necessary. I'm just going out for groceries and necessities. And of course, I saw lines and also at the gas stations.\nFRAYER: Lamboglia says what comes next is uncertain. And she told us she feels scared.\nAre you hopeful for the future, for change?\nLAMBOGLIA: That's a hard question. We don't even know who's running our country. It's not clear.\nFRAYER: For now, there is huge uncertainty, and people want to wait and see, says Carpio in Caracas.\nCARPIO: There's this what we call tensa calma, which is a tense calmness.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MODERATOR'S \"COSMIC\")\nCopyright © 2026 NPR.

I got along with him very well, despite the Russia-Russia-Russia hoax, which was a total hoax.\nFRAYER: His emphasis on personal diplomacy and his accommodating tone radically changed the message from the White House about how the U.S. sees Russia and in turn how Russia sees the U.S.\nCHARLES MAYNES, BYLINE: The U.S. was the main adversary of Russia. Now it's the arrival of the Trump administration. Suddenly, the U.S. is seen as really sympathetic to Russian views.\nFRAYER: NPR's Charles Maynes lives in Moscow and has been reporting on Russia and the former Soviet Union for more than a decade.\nMAYNES: I was actually a student in Russia in the '90s in Moscow, part of this generation that was really drawn to these changes, just wanted to see what was happening after the fall of the Soviet Union. And it was remarkable because - I used to tell friends at the time, and I still think so - it's like opera. It's full of heroes, and it's full of villains.\nFRAYER: For this week's Reporter's Notebook, I spoke with Charles about what it's been like to cover one of the biggest pivots in U.S.-Russian relations and a rapidly changing wartime Russia.\nMAYNES: Hopes, I think, were really high initially that Trump could really end this war as he'd promised in 24 hours - famously promised - precisely because he seemed to be offering Putin so much, if not most, of what he wanted in Ukraine, for example, an end to NATO's expansion, a recognition of some of these Russian land grabs. And yet, I think, you know, those hopes are really fading at this point.\nFRAYER: You first went to Russia in the '90s. I mean, how do Russians view the U.S. now versus then?\nMAYNES: Well, there was a lot of excitement about the relationship with America. Back in the '90s, Russia was definitely hard on its luck at that point. The economy was a mess. The politics were very unstable. And this has become sort of the Putin myth, of course, that he arrived and suddenly Russia kind of ushered in this new era of stability. But, you know, what you've seen, essentially, is that attitudes towards Americans I find actually are quite good on a personal level. I don't feel any animosity towards me in particular when I talk to people. In fact, they seem more kind of curious that I'm here, but I do think that there's frustration with the American government in particular.\nFRAYER: So do you actually have Russians telling you that they're frustrated with the American government and their own?\nMAYNES: Yes, yes, definitely.\nFRAYER: And do you have to worry about protecting your sources in that way? They could get in trouble for talking to you?\nMAYNES: Well, I'm very sensitive to the fact that they can say things that could land them in prison. At the same time at NPR, we've made some allowances in our editorial rules. Often, we allow just the first name to be provided if they explain why, and the answer is usually this fear of government reprisals. That, for example, was the case while covering the funeral of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic prison in Russia in February of 2024. Certainly his supporters would say he was murdered. Like a lot of things in Russia today, Navalny's movement is banned, but his supporters - many of them younger Russians - seemed really relieved to get their message out to a Western reporter on a day that I came to see Navalny's grave. Here's a bit from a conversation I had with a young woman named Sofia that I met outside the graveyard where he's buried.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)\nSOFIA: I was smiling because I saw this is the feeling of you're not alone - finally being able to speak out because I think you understand that it's impossible to give such an interview to local journalists because it might get you in jail pretty quickly.\nFRAYER: Wow. I mean, I remember where I was on the street in London when my phone lit up with that alert that Navalny had died. Is it like JFK's assassination? I mean, is it that seminal a moment for Russians?\nMAYNES: Well, it's a huge moment in the history of modern Russia, I think. I mean, it was a tragedy on so many levels. Of course, Navalny was a father, a husband. He has two children, and he was only 45 years old. So it was a big moment in terms of just the politics of this country and also a little bit of the road not taken.\nFRAYER: Can you describe, like, a day in the life of Charles Maynes? How do you know what's safe for you?\nMAYNES: I don't think they are hard rules in Russia. You have a sense of what's probably allowed. You can certainly mitigate some of the risks. For example, smaller towns these days are a little bit more suspect. But that said, you know, the moments I have been able to get out and visit smaller places around Russia, that's been really illuminating because this is where the soldiers, the recruits for the war in Ukraine are coming from. For example, I made a trip out to a town called Yefremov - this is a small town about five hours to the south of Moscow - to report on a court case there, and here's a little bit of tape from that story.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)\nMAYNES: About a mile from the courthouse, a group of Russian tricolor flags in a far corner of the local cemetery guide my suspicion through the spring mud to a group of fresh graves.\nFive, six, seven, eight, maybe more.\nOfficial counts of Russia's war dead remain incredibly low, but the toll of the conflict is evident if you look for it.\nAlexander Boltachev, born in 1996, died December 2, 2022.\nFRAYER: It's so valuable to have you there. It's, I imagine, the equivalent of covering the U.S. and never leaving New York or Washington. It would be inadequate, right?\nMAYNES: Exactly. And it is frustrating that we don't have more access. But I do think that at least my approach has been to look at it more as a kaleidoscope. I try and find different stories that tackle different aspects of the war and of what's happening to society, whether it's through culture, talking to soldiers, talking to nationalists, talking to the opposition or the underground opposition at this point. You know, all these provide more and more of a sense of what's happening in Russia.\nFRAYER: And where do Russians get their information?\nMAYNES: Well, you know, at the outset of the war, independent media was either forced into exile or shut down. There are new criminal penalties introduced. So you'd have these moments where you'd meet people who would just espouse kind of Kremlin propaganda talking points. One example might be a gentleman I met on Red Square early on in the war when he argued that World War II, the war against fascism in Europe, had never ended.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)\nMAYNES: Andrei Nikolaevich, an older Muscovite I met there, told me the Nazis have returned.\nANDREI NIKOLAEVICH: And we expect peace, but peace should be with victory over the Nazis, new Nazis who occupied all the country of Ukraine.\nMAYNES: Do you worry about Russian forces killing other people, though, like innocent civilians, too?\nNIKOLAEVICH: No, it's all fake because we don't kill human beings that are peaceful. We kill only the soldiers.\nMAYNES: You know, and then again, Lauren, you know, in Russia, it's a criminal offense to suggest otherwise. But there are ways to get information from a variety of sources. The problem here is that it's increasingly difficult. You know, websites are blocked, sharing content on social media is criminalized, Western social media channels and services like YouTube, Facebook, WhatsApp - they're either blocked or throttled to the point where they're basically unusable. And that's really a source of growing frustration to many Russians. The walls are closing in, and increasingly, people exist in this curated Kremlin information bubble, that's for sure.\nFRAYER: So how do you break through that? I mean, it's just so difficult to do your journalism.\nMAYNES: Well, I spend a lot of time turning a VPN on and off. I can tell you that much. You have to turn it off to read the Kremlin sites and turn it on to read the Russian independent media, which is all in exile and all blocked here.\nFRAYER: You're like, toggling between two different worlds.\nMAYNES: This sort of digital cage, it's shrinking. You can feel it. I feel it.\nFRAYER: Is there, like, one memory or story that sticks out with you?\nMAYNES: In the first year that they held Victory Day ceremonies on Red Square - this is on May 9. Most people know it as, you know, when the Russians parade the tanks and the soldiers and all the rest of it. You know, the war in Ukraine had started. People are dying. People are coming back with missing limbs. And as the ceremony finished, and of course, I'm in this kind of nest of loyalists - I mean, these are all people that are clearly supporters of the president and his policies - but it still really struck me to watch him walk off the square surrounded by his bodyguards. He's about, I don't know, 20 feet from me, and people behind me just start clapping and saying, thank you, thank you. And I just - yeah, after all that had happened over the previous few months, that still struck me as just mind-blowing.\nFRAYER: That's NPR's Moscow correspondent Charles Maynes speaking with us from the Russian capital. Thanks.\nMAYNES: Thanks, Lauren.\nCopyright © 2026 NPR. All rights reserved.

The leadership in the West Bank represented by the Palestinian Authority is deeply unpopular. Elections haven't been held in almost 20 years when Hamas won the last ones. Both the Palestinian Authority and President Trump say they see no role for that group in Gaza's future governance. As we start the new year, there is a unifying political figure who used to be part of the Palestinian Authority and remains popular today. But he's in Israeli prison and has been for the last 23 years. Marwan Barghouti said this while in Israeli court in 2004.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nMARWAN BARGHOUTI: Security will be achieved by one way, by one way, by peace. And peace will be achieved by the end of the occupation.\nFRAYER: He's serving five life sentences plus 40 years for what Israel says was murder and terrorism, which Barghouti denies. He's now 66 years old, and Israel refused to include his name in any hostage exchange deals. And we have his son, Arab Barghouti, with us on the show. Welcome.\nARAB BARGHOUTI: Thank you so much for having me.\nFRAYER: How is your father doing right now?\nA BARGHOUTI: In the last two years, as you know, the whole of the Palestinian people have gone through, like, the collective punishment policy of the Israeli government, and I think that the political prisoners were one of the biggest targets after our people of Gaza, of course. My father was targeted in the last two years. He was sent right after October 7 to solitary confinement, even though obviously he has nothing to do with it. Because of his influence and his impact, they wanted to silence him. He was denied from any family visitation. He was only visited a few times by his lawyer.\nFRAYER: And have - when was the last time you were able to visit him?\nA BARGHOUTI: I haven't been able to see my father in more than three years. None of the family members has been able to see him in the last three years, which tells you that this has been happening since before October 7, and I haven't been able to hug my father in 24 years. And it's very important to understand that I represent thousands of families who are going through the same suffering and don't get talked about enough.\nFRAYER: Your father is an advocate for a two-state solution. He has said he's willing to recognize Israel next to an independent Palestinian state. He's been compared to Nelson Mandela. How do you feel about that comparison? And how does he?\nA BARGHOUTI: Well, personally, it makes me feel proud. Nelson Mandela is not only my role model, but a role model to all of the Palestinian people and all of the free people around the world. But there are differences between our struggle and the South African struggle. We share having an apartheid regime, but at the same time, they haven't been bombarded, killed at the rate that we've been killed and the violence that we face as Palestinians.\nFRAYER: The two-state solution used to be Israeli policy. It is not something that the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is currently pushing for. How would your father negotiate that?\nA BARGHOUTI: You know, you're dealing with an Israeli government that doesn't want peace. And that's exactly where I think the international community - and when I say the international community, obviously, it's basically the U.S. and a few other countries, but especially the U.S. - if they put the right pressure on the Israeli government, we will get to a point where they have to come and negotiate a political settlement 'cause there is no way out.\nFRAYER: Among Palestinian Authority figures, polls show that your father has support from Palestinians of all different factions, unlike the current leadership in the West Bank. If your father does get released from prison, do you think he will take that step and enter political life again?\nA BARGHOUTI: What I can tell you is that my father was planning to run for the presidential elections that were supposed to happen in 2021, but then they got canceled. I do think that we as Palestinians, in order to renew the political life, the political system, we have to have general elections as soon as possible. You're talking about a political system that has been dysfunctional for almost two decades. If you're 35 or under in Palestine, you've never voted before. That's wrong. We need youth participation, more women in power, having progressive ideas and original ideas in order for us to build the state that we all dream of and fulfill the dream that my father has always talked about.\nFRAYER: I want to ask you, Arab, about you. You are a life coach. You grew up with a father behind bars on terrorism charges. How has that shaped you and your life choices?\nA BARGHOUTI: Well, to be honest with you, I think that this is not part of my life. This is my whole life. I grew up in the West Bank, and the only normal lives I had with my family was between the '94, which is the Oslo Accords, when as a family, we came back from Jordan, where my father was exiled and not allowed to be in Palestine. And then until when the second intifada broke. You know, as a kid who was 11, 12, and the assassination attempts of my father and the violence in Ramallah and the bombardment and all of that, of course, impacted me. At the beginning, I had some resentment towards the Palestinian cause because in my opinion, as a kid, I thought that it took away my dad, and that was something hard to go through.\nBut then when I grew up, I learned more about my father. I visited him in prison, which was rare, but at least I could see him, have conversations with him. And when I understood the Palestinian cause, when I understood my father's personality and why he chose this path, my respect to him grew even more, and I understood that it's a noble cause. He's sacrificing for his people. He's sacrificing for a just cause. And this is something that I truly admire. And now I have a responsibility to represent him, to help the international campaign for his release as soon as possible.\nFRAYER: That's Arab Barghouti, son of Marwan Barghouti, a prominent Palestinian leader who is currently in Israeli prison. Thank you.\nA BARGHOUTI: Thank you.\nCopyright © 2026 NPR. All rights reserved.

Manuel Rueda reports from Bogotá, Colombia.\nLAUREN FRAYER, HOST:\nOne day after the United States attacked Venezuela, seized and imprisoned the president and first lady on drug charges, the question is, who's in charge there now? President Trump claims his administration will run Venezuela until, quote, \"a safe and proper and judicious transition is possible.\" He says Venezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, has expressed her willingness to work with the U.S. But in her first comments after being sworn in as interim leader, she condemned the U.S. action. Joining us now to talk about all of this is Venezuelan journalist Manuel Rueda, who is currently in Colombia. Welcome.\nMANUEL RUEDA: Hi. Good afternoon.\nFRAYER: Manuel, tell us what the situation is today in Venezuela. What's the reaction there?\nRUEDA: Well, people are pretty nervous. It's a quiet situation. Most people are basically staying at home. When they do go out, they're going to supermarkets to do some shopping. We've seen long lines at supermarkets, just to buy extra things, like, for example, water or tuna cans, in case the situation gets out of control again and shops have to close. Overall...\nFRAYER: Can you tell...\nRUEDA: ...Though, it's a calm situation.\nFRAYER: Can you tell us more about Rodriguez, the interim leader? Is there any clarity on how she's going to navigate this?\nRUEDA: Yeah. So she's a longtime member of Venezuela's ruling party, the Socialist Party. She's been a foreign minister, oil minister. Now she's a vice president. And she is quite an influential figure, working very closely with her brother Jorge, who is the head of Venezuela's National Assembly. So far, what we know is the Supreme Court issued a ruling last night naming her the interim president, arguing that Maduro is temporarily unavailable to carry out his duties 'cause he's in jail in the United States. And that gives her a 90-day period, which can be extended to another 90 days. So she seems to be in there for at least six months.\nFRAYER: President Trump has said that U.S. oil companies will be investing in, reviving and taking over Venezuela's oil sector. What's been the reaction to that?\nRUEDA: Well, Rodriguez said very clearly in her first television appearance after the attacks that Venezuela would not be a U.S. colony. She's trying to present, like, a strong front against the U.S. government, probably not to encourage dissent within her own ruling party. But under the table, there could be many negotiations going on, you know? What will her administration offer Trump in order to be allowed to stay in power, to lift, for example, the oil embargo that the U.S. has on Venezuela? Marco Rubio spoke today and said that the priorities were, you know, competitors of the U.S. not getting rich off Venezuelan's oil, terrorist groups like Hezbollah leaving Venezuela and no more drug trafficking. So we'll see how the negotiations along those issues go.\nFRAYER: And what about Maria Corina Machado, the opposition leader who won the Nobel Prize, the Nobel Peace Prize last year? She dedicated the prize to Trump, but she's nowhere to be seen. What do we know about how she fits in?\nRUEDA: Yeah. She seems to have been sidelined by the Trump administration. You know, after the attacks happened, a few hours after that, she issued a statement saying that her colleague, Edmundo Gonzalez, who won the 2024 elections, should be installed in power immediately. Of course, that did not happen. Trump said he would not be working with her. And since then, the Venezuelan opposition has been silent. I suspect that they must be trying to reach out to the Trump administration to do some coordination because they've been left flat-footed. They look kind of bad after, you know, issuing a statement saying that now it's time for change, and then Trump saying they're not going to work with them.\nFRAYER: That's Manuel Rueda, a Venezuelan journalist speaking to us from Bogota, Colombia. Thank you.\nRUEDA: You're welcome.\nCopyright © 2026 NPR. All rights reserved.

Americans may still get to enjoy Italian pasta in the United States after all, now that the Trump administration has rolled back an earlier threat of high tariffs. NPR's Rome correspondent, Ruth Sherlock, reports.\nRUTH SHERLOCK, BYLINE: The threat by the Trump administration to hit 13 Italian pasta brands with combined duties and tariffs of some 107% became major national news in the U.S. Here's NBC's \"Today\"...\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Americans could soon be saying arrivederci to their favorite Italian pastas.\nSHERLOCK: ...And ABC News.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Well, mamma mia. Thanks to Trump's tariffs, Italian pasta may disappear from grocery shelves as soon as January. Italy's biggest...\nSHERLOCK: The U.S. Department of Commerce accused these companies of selling their products at a cheaper price than in their domestic market. This allegation of dumping was routine, but the sky-high duties they threatened to impose were not. It ballooned into a diplomatic affair between the U.S. and the highest levels of the Italian government.\nETTORE PRANDINI: (Speaking Italian).\nSHERLOCK: Ettore Prandini, the president of Coldiretti, Italy's biggest agricultural union, who was involved in the talks, says Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni spoke directly with President Trump.\nPRANDINI: (Speaking Italian).\nSHERLOCK: Now one of the accused Italian pasta brands, La Molisana, will see the duties reduced from the threatened 97% to just 2.26%. Most of the other involved companies may pay around 9%. The Commerce Department said in an emailed statement to NPR that they had changed their position after the Italian pasta-makers addressed concerns raised in a review. Prandini sees the pasta duties as part of President Trump's broader regime of tariffs on foreign goods to favor domestic producers.\nPRANDINI: (Speaking Italian).\nSHERLOCK: He says this was a move to penalize Italian pasta-makers and push them out of the U.S. market.\nPRANDINI: (Speaking Italian).\nSHERLOCK: The White House has rolled back tariffs on more than 200 food products in recent months, in a move widely seen as an effort to address voter discontent over high consumer prices and cost of living.\nRuth Sherlock, NPR News.\nCopyright © 2026 NPR.

Is 2026 the end of the sneakerhead era?\nSome sneaker resellers are despairing as once pricey pairs now sit on shelves unsold. NPR's Ayesha Rascoe speaks with Mike Sykes II from the Business of Fashion about the changing market for sneakers.\nAYESHA RASCOE, HOST:\nAre we seeing the death of sneakers? Not just any old pair you'd wear to the gym. We're talking about the highly coveted shoes like limited edition Nike Jordans and Adidas Superstars. They're bought, swapped and resold among collectors or sneakerheads.\nMIKE SYKES II: A few years ago, limited edition shoes were reselling on the aftermarket for 100% to 200% of a premium. Nowadays, that's not the case. People aren't willing to do that anymore.\nRASCOE: Mike Sykes II is a sports and fashion correspondent at the Business of Fashion. Welcome to the program.\nSYKES: Thanks for having me.\nRASCOE: What's going on with the market for sneakers right now?\nSYKES: So the market today is vastly different. The values are deflated at this point. Like, you could see, if you look at the resale price for a lost-and-found Jordan 1, something that dropped in 2023, so many people were trying to buy this shoe. And the resale price would go upward of, like, $500 to $600 for a $180 shoe, which is a nice premium.\nRASCOE: Yeah.\nSYKES: But these days, you could probably buy that shoe, depending on the size and where you're looking for it at, for around high $200s, maybe $300, which is, you know, not cheap for the everyday consumer. But for someone who is collecting sneakers or really into this stuff, that's not that much, considering what the price was back then.\nRASCOE: You know, millennials are blamed for killing a lot of industries. But can we lay the cooling down of the sneaker market at the feet of Gen Z, or is this more about the economy as a whole?\nSYKES: I would say, honestly, it's a little bit of both. Like, I think you could put this on Gen Z if you wanted to, but personally, I think this is a great thing. Like, more power to them, that they are finding new styles that fit with the way that they want to present themselves to the world. But then, on the other hand, like you said, there are general macroeconomic conditions that have contributed to this, right? So you - I mean, obviously, like, people talk about inflation a ton. You've got the tariffs that have bumped up prices on some of these shoes. You've also got Nike not being as strong as it was. It's the industry leader. And so people are just a little bit less interested in some of the limited and exclusive products, right? And so when you fuse all of those things together, that's when you get the depressed marketplace that we're seeing on the secondary market.\nRASCOE: So where do you think the sneaker market goes from here?\nSYKES: So I think this is all cyclical. I mean, fashion just generally moves in cycles. Now people just aren't as into those classic styles that have worked so much for so many years. It will come back around inevitably.\nRASCOE: You're a big sneaker collector yourself, so are there any pairs that you have your eyes on while prices are lower?\nSYKES: I mean, there are too many to...\nRASCOE: (Laughter).\nSYKES: ...Count, if I'm being completely honest with you. One pair that I've been looking at for years - the Northern Light Nike Dunks in the low cut. Like, the high tops? I could probably have gotten those a few years ago. But the lows? I mean, there was one point in 2021 - this is, like, the last point that I remember looking at them, at least - they were at about $700 at that time. And I was just like, I can't do that. I can't do that. And so hopefully - I don't know. Maybe I'll circle back, treat myself a little bit. I don't know.\nRASCOE: That's Mike Sykes II. He's a sports and fashion correspondent at the Business of Fashion. Thank you so much.\nSYKES: Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.\nCopyright © 2026 NPR. All rights reserved.

The crypto king pushed higher despite geopolitical tension following the US strike on Venezuela.\nMarkets remained resilient, suggesting investors prioritized liquidity trends and institutional demand over short-term macro uncertainty.\nBitcoin Whales Change Stance\nWhale behavior shifted noticeably over the past day. Addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 BTC had sold roughly 50,000 BTC between December 29 and January 3. That distribution phase reflected caution as Bitcoin consolidated below major resistance.\nOver the last 24 hours, those same whale wallets reversed course. They accumulated about 10,000 BTC, valued at $912 million, after Bitcoin crossed the $90,000 level. This renewed accumulation signals confidence among large holders and may help absorb near-term selling pressure.\nWant more token insights like this?

If accumulation continues, it could reinforce support levels and stabilize Bitcoin’s advance during early 2026.\nAre Bitcoin Miners a Concern?\nMiner behavior introduces a counterweight to bullish sentiment. The miner net position change shows selling has increased sharply over the past 24 hours. Outflows rose from 55 BTC to 604 BTC, reflecting miners capitalizing on higher prices to realize profits.\nWhile the volume remains modest relative to total market supply, miner selling still affects short-term dynamics. Increased issuance entering the market can dampen upside momentum, especially if demand growth slows. This selling may limit the pace of Bitcoin’s climb rather than reverse it outright.\nMiners typically sell during strength to fund operations. Their activity does not necessarily signal bearish conviction. However, combined with broader profit-taking, it can delay breakouts until fresh demand absorbs the added supply.\nBTC Price Breakout Awaits A Confirmation\nBitcoin broke out of a six-week descending wedge over the past 24 hours, trading near $91,327 at the time of writing. This technical escape suggests momentum is improving.\nTo sustain the breakout, Bitcoin must secure $92,031 as support, which would open a path toward $95,000.\nBullish confirmation requires reclaiming key moving averages. The 50-day EMA near $91,554 and the 365-day EMA around $97,403 currently act as resistance.\nFlipping these levels into support would signal a stronger trend reversal and improve the odds of a move back above $100,000.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-price-finally-breaks-6-185539064.html", "published_at": "2026-01-04T18:55:39+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Schmidt added that not all of the water in the reservoirs will be usable, and said, \"We're closer to the edge of the cliff than we realize.\"\nThree-quarters of the water usage in Utah goes towards agriculture, so low levels and potential droughts could have a severe impact on food systems, farmers' income, and the economy as a whole.\nAs well as that, droughts can leave people without water in their homes and can result in wildfires and other extreme weather events.\nThis snow drought is another piece of a worrying pattern that could have severe impacts on the health of people and the planet.

For example, water could be released from the Flaming Gorge Reservoir in northeast Utah to fill up Lake Powell. Another option would be to reduce the amount of water being let off to go to California, Arizona, and Nevada.\nUltimately, the rising temperatures and carbon pollution need to be tackled to prevent further droughts.\nMore in U.S.\nIn your personal life, you could consider installing solar panels, switching to an electric vehicle, or upgrading your lawn to a less water-intensive native lawn.\nTo protect your house from potential droughts, you could consider collecting rainwater for a free supply of water.\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/experts-sound-alarm-unprecedented-phenomenon-024500039.html", "published_at": "2026-01-05T02:45:00+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

It wasn't until this whole diagnosis, everything happened, that I went back and looked at pictures and realized how much it had changed,\" the Virginia resident shares with PEOPLE.\nBecause Mullins was recently postpartum, her dermatologist decided to wait six months before doing a biopsy.\nOn Oct. 24, 2025, Mullins finally went in for the medical procedure, and one week later, she learned she had melanoma. She was diagnosed with Stage 0 skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ, meaning that the cancer was on top of her skin and hadn't spread yet.\nJust before Thanksgiving, she had surgery to remove the mole and the surrounding area.\n\"If it wasn't for that skin check I had scheduled, I don't know when I would've realized that I had melanoma on my face,\" she shares, noting that she had seen multiple dermatologists in the past and no one had ever raised concerns about the mole.\nAfter the surgery, Mullins shares that she was feeling \"pretty good\" — until she took her bandages off.\n\"Two days after I took off my bandage from the procedure, that's when it hit me,\" she says. \"Before then, it was just a diagnosis on paper, and even during the procedure, I wasn't worried, scared or anything.\"\n\"Once I saw the impact on my face, it hit me, and not because of aesthetics. It just became reality. It was a tangible thing,\" Mullins shares.\nMore in Health\nWhile the mole was just a small dot on her face, the incision stretched nearly her entire cheek, since doctors often remove the area around the lesion in hopes of eliminating as much potential cancer as possible.\nHer scar will take a full year to heal, but in the meantime, her doctor recommended \"time, patience, and Vaseline.\"\n\"He said, 'Just give it time. Just let your body do what it needs to do,'\" she shares.\nHowever, Mullins emphasizes that she's less concerned about the scar and more focused on her health.\n\"My number one importance was just getting this cancer out of me and moving forward,\" she tells PEOPLE. \"It's important to note that some people do care about that, and that's okay; that's valid, too. I don't want my experience and 'ugly scar' to scare people away from getting skin checks.\"\nMoving forward, she will get full-body scans every four months, something she will likely have to stay on top of for the rest of her life.\n\"Because this popped up, I have a higher chance of developing another one now. Thankfully, because it was caught at Stage 0, I don't need further treatment. So it's not like I need chemo,\" she says. \"Now it's taking care of my scar right now, making sure it stays hydrated and making sure that the rest of my body... trying to notice any changes I might have in moles and being more aware of my skin.\"\nMullins \"randomly\" decided to share her health journey on TikTok, which \"took off and resonated with people.\" She has since become an advocate for regular skin checks.\n\"I continued sharing my journey, especially after I learned that I could get skin cancer. I'm Latina, and my parents are both from Peru. I didn't think that this would ever be a cancer I could get,\" she admits. \"I wasn't taught that that was something I could get. I thought it was really eye-opening and important for other people to know this.\"\nAlthough some users were shocked by the size of Mullins' scar, others reminded her that the \"scar is a lifeline\" and that they'd \"rather have a scar than cancer.\"\nAs for anyone who might find themselves in a similar position, Mullins says to \"take it one step at a time.\"\n\"Go with what your doctor is saying, because it's easy to Google, [go] on TikTok, and spiral, but just go with the advice of your doctor and take it one step at a time,\" she tells PEOPLE. \"It is a lot to process, and this isn't anything to be ashamed or afraid of alone.\"\n\"If you have a support system, really, really lean on it, because I don't think I would've been able to muster the strength without it,\" Mullins adds.\nHer diagnosis has motivated her to focus on her health in 2026 and beyond.\n\"Ever since this diagnosis, now I'm like, okay, I need to get my other things checked that I've been neglecting, because when you're a mom, you just put yourself last. It's easy to fall behind on things, but I've scheduled everything I need to schedule, and I'm getting everything checked out, a little bit at a time,\" she says.\n\"I'm trying to be more preventative than having to face the consequences of putting stuff off.\"\nRead the original article on People", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/woman-says-she-felt-pretty-103000685.html", "published_at": "2026-01-04T10:30:00+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Lavrov also criticized Kyiv for launching the attack at a moment of intensive negotiations to end the war.\nThe allegation came just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had traveled to Florida for talks with Trump on the U.S. administration's still-evolving 20-point plan aimed at ending the war. Zelenskyy quickly denied the Kremlin allegation.\nTrump said that “something happened nearby” Putin's residence but that Americans officials didn't find the Russian president's residence was targeted.\n“I don’t believe that strike happened,\" Trump told reporters as he traveled back to Washington on Sunday after spending two weeks at his home in Florida. “We don't believe that happened, now that we've been able to check.”\nTrump addressed the U.S. determination after European officials argued that the Russian claim was nothing more than an effort by Moscow to undermine the peace effort.\nBut Trump, at least initially, had appeared to take the Russian allegations at face value. He told reporters last Monday that Putin had also raised the matter during a phone he had with the Russian leader earlier that day. And Trump said he was “very angry” about the accusation.\nBy Wednesday, Trump appeared to be downplaying the Russian claim. He posted a link to a New York Post editorial on his social media platform that raised doubt about the Russian allegation. The editorial lambasted Putin for choosing \"lies, hatred, and death” at a moment that Trump has claimed is “closer than ever before” to moving the two sides to a deal to end the war.\nThe U.S. president has struggled to fulfill a pledge to quickly end the war in Ukraine and has shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin as he tried to mediate an end to a conflict he boasted on the campaign trail that he could end in one day.\nBoth Trump and Zelenskyy said last week they made progress in their talks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\nBut Putin has shown little interest in ending the war until all of Russia's objectives are met, including winning control of all Ukrainian territory in the key industrial Donbas region and imposing severe restrictions on the size of Ukraine's post-war military and the type of weaponry it can possess.\n___\nMadhani reported from Washington.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-says-ukraine-didnt-target-013008709.html", "published_at": "2026-01-05T01:30:08+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Is this legal?", "body": "", "content": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\nOnce you turn 65, there is a 70% chance that you are going to need some kind of long-term care during the remainder of your lifetime, according to LongTermCare.gov (1).\nUnfortunately, paying for this care can be very difficult: According to SeniorLiving.org, the median price of a semi-private room in a nursing home is $114,665 per year as of 2025 (2).\nLet's say that your 80-year-old mother spent a month in the hospital and was sent to a skilled nursing facility because she's unable to manage on her own.\nHowever, her insurance claims she doesn’t need care and the nursing home wants to take all her Social Security and pension checks to pay the bills.\nCan the nursing home take that money, even though your mother has bills to pay, debts she took on before getting sick and a home she wants to maintain after she gets out of the care facility?\nHere's what you need to know.\nCan a nursing home or skilled nursing facility take your money?\nThe first thing to know is that Medicare is probably your mom's insurer, as it covers most Americans who are 65 and over.\nIf your mom has chosen a Medicare Advantage Plan, it will be administered by a private insurer, and it must cover all that Medicare does.\nMedicare does not ever cover routine nursing care (called custodial care) for those who can't do basic life tasks. Medicare does cover skilled nursing care for up to 100 days, but only under limited circumstances, such as when you've just left the hospital.\nSince your mother just left the hospital, you may want to appeal the denial of the skilled nursing care. If her doctor or care provider believes your mother needs professional care, you should see if they will support your efforts to file an appeal with Medicare.\nMedicare has information on how you can appeal a denial to try to get covered.\nIf your appeal isn't successful, your mother will be considered a private pay patient. While she will not have her benefits seized, she will be billed for nursing home care and expected to pay the bills. Nursing homes usually bill in advance, so she'll have to cover her costs to keep her place.\nIf your mother cannot pay, the nursing home can ask her to leave with \"reasonable and appropriate notice,\" if she's not in the process of applying for Medicare or Medicaid.\nMedicaid does pay for nursing care, but she has to qualify, which means she can't have countable property or resources above $2,000.\nOnce she is on Medicaid, she will be required to send her Social Security checks to the nursing home, minus a small personal-needs allowance and minus other insurance premiums she may be paying.\nSo, unfortunately, based on the current rules, the nursing home can take almost all your mom's money if she isn't successful at appealing and getting Medicare to cover her skilled care, but she still needs to be in a home.\nThe best thing to do to avoid this happening is to be prepared for the chance of going into a nursing home by buying long-term care insurance.\nLong-term care insurance offers coverage for the costs of in-home assistance, nursing homes or assisted living facilities.\nWithout proper planning, paying for long-term care could deplete your retirement fund. In many cases, the burden of paying for care often falls on family members — potentially straining their finances.\nWhen considering long-term care insurance, GoldenCare offers different options based on your needs, including hybrid life or annuity with long-term care benefits, short-term care, extended care, home health care, assisted living and traditional long-term care insurance.\nYou can always choose to talk with an elder law attorney to help you appeal the Medicare denial or see what can be done to protect your mom's assets, but nursing home planning usually needs to begin long before the time care is needed.\nIf your mother’s benefit checks are big enough to cover the nursing home, and if you can put payments on her other debt and on her mortgage into forbearance, that may be your best bet if the situation is really temporary and she hopes to return home.\nIf the nursing home costs too much and she can't afford the fees, looking into a home health aide could be an option, too.\nBuilding a cushion for retirement\nWith such stringent rules around long-term care, it’s critical that older Americans have a strong financial cushion for their last years and to help them manage the cost of long-term care. Starting early is key, but you can also start small.\nAcorns automates investing and saving to simplify the process of setting aside extra funds.\nIt’s an easy way to grow your retirement nest egg without even thinking about it, and can help you to save even after you retire.\nInvesting in real estate without buying property\nDiversifying your investments is also critical to ensuring your portfolio grows steadily. Alternative assets like real estate and gold can help shield your nest egg from inflation and volatility.\nOne way to tap into the real estate market is to invest in private credit funds that generate monthly income.\nFor example, with the Arrived Private Credit Fund, you can invest in short-term loans used to fund real estate projects, such as renovations, property rehabs or even new home construction. The minimum investment is $100, meaning that this opportunity is open to every type of investor.\nAll of the loans are secured by residential housing as collateral, so even if the borrowers default, the underlying property can be sold to keep the fund healthy.\nGold is also on a record high streak right now, with investors flocking to the precious metal amid economic uncertainty.\nA gold IRA allows you to take advantage of this hot commodity without the hassle of investing in a physical asset.\nOpening a gold IRA with the help of Goldco allows you to invest in gold and other precious metals while also providing the significant tax advantages of an IRA.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mom-80-needs-special-care-190500257.html", "published_at": "2026-01-04T19:05:00+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

After eventually discontinuing the ultra-thin TVs in 2020, LG is finally reviving the Wallpaper TV series with the OLED evo W6 that will make its debut at CES 2026. LG is marketing the updated Wallpaper TV as the \"world's thinnest\" OLED that's truly wireless, making some major upgrades to the original.\nInstead of the companion soundbar that housed all the ports, LG designed the Zero Connect Box that hosts all the inputs and can transmit from up to roughly 32 feet away. It's similar to what Samsung has been doing with its Wireless One Connect Box, which is often paired with its Frame TV lineup. While you won't have to worry about a web of tangled wires or a clunky soundbar, the OLED evo W6 measures slightly thicker at 9mm, compared to its predecessor's hyperthin 2.6mm measurement. That's more than three times the thickness, but it's still impressive if you consider that the W6 will feel about as thick as putting an iPhone 17 Pro Max against your wall.\nThe latest Wallpaper TV does come with plenty of improvements, though, including LG's third-gen α 11 Processor. LG also added its new Hyper Radiant Color Technology to the W6, which translates to deeper blacks, improved colors and higher brightness levels. There's even a Brightness Booster Ultra feature that LG claims results in four times the brightness of conventional OLED. To complement the extra nits, LG specifically designed a screen that reduces reflections for the Wallpaper TV.\nThe updated W6 can handle gaming better, too, since it supports a 4K 165Hz refresh rate and has a 0.1 pixel response time that's crucial for competitive gaming. LG added compatibility with NVIDIA's G-Sync, AMD's FreeSync Premium, Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot. When you're not using the Wallpaper TV, LG has its Gallery+ feature that can display screensaver visuals, personal photos or images created with generative AI.\nLG didn't reveal what sizes the upgraded Wallpaper TV would be available in, but it will be on display later this week at CES 2026. LG hasn't offered any clues about pricing yet either, but we wouldn't be surprised to see an equally shocking price as compared to the last Wallpaper TV, which cost up to $20,000.", "url": "https://tech.yahoo.com/home-entertainment/tvs/article/lg-brought-back-wallpaper-tv-030057463.html", "published_at": "2026-01-05T03:00:57+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nNational average mortgage rates basically unchanged from last weekend. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.01%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.44%. It has been an extended period of very calm mortgage rates.\nCurrent mortgage rates\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n-\n30-year fixed: 6.01%\n-\n20-year fixed: 5.95%\n-\n15-year fixed: 5.44%\n-\n5/1 ARM: 6.23%\n-\n7/1 ARM: 6.51%\n-\n30-year VA: 5.52%\n-\n15-year VA: 5.14%\n-\n5/1 VA: 5.22%\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\nCurrent mortgage refinance rates\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n-\n30-year fixed: 6.16%\n-\n20-year fixed: 5.97%\n-\n15-year fixed: 5.61%\n-\n5/1 ARM: 6.32%\n-\n7/1 ARM: 6.56%\n-\n30-year VA: 5.74%\n-\n15-year VA: 5.44%\n-\n5/1 VA: 5.40%\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\nMonthly mortgage payment calculator\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments.\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use. It also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n30-year vs. 15-year fixed mortgage rates\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate today is 6.01%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.44% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.\nLet’s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 6.01% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,800, and you’d pay $348,209 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.44% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,442. But you’d only pay $139,508 in interest over the years.\nFixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\nHow to get a low mortgage rate\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\nHow to choose a mortgage lender\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\nCurrent mortgage rates: FAQs\nWhat is a mortgage interest rate at right now?\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate for purchasing a home is 6.01%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.44%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas.\nWhat's a good mortgage rate right now?\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.01% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI).\nAre mortgage rates expected to drop?\nNot much. According to its December forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026.

Can it also build them?\nIndia is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets.\nIndiGo and Air India, which together hold over 90% of the market, have ordered nearly 1,500 planes over the next decade, highlighting soaring passenger demand.\nThis expansion hinges on Boeing and Airbus, which together supply 86% of the world's aircraft and faced \"historically high\" delivery backlogs in 2024 - delays expected to affect Indian orders too.\nThis has revived an old question: should India try to build its own passenger planes?\nThe prospect drew attention in October, when India and Russia signed an initial agreement in Moscow to manufacture the SJ-100 passenger plane in India, raising hopes for domestic aircraft production.\nBut is the Russia deal a solution? Its joint manufacturing plan still faces many hurdles before coming to fruition.\nThe SJ-100 is a twin-engine aircraft that can carry up to 103 passengers and is already in service with several Russian airlines, according to its manufacturer, United Aircraft Corporation (UAC).\nDelhi has described the aircraft as a \"game changer\" and plans to use it for short-haul routes. But experts have questioned the project's cost and feasibility - much of which is still unclear.\nOne of the biggest concerns is whether the Russian firm would be able to rapidly set up and scale production in India.\nThe aircraft's manufacturer says it delivered around 200 SJ-100 aircraft between 2008 and 2020. But that trajectory shifted in 2022 when Russia launched its war against Ukraine.\nMore in World\nWestern sanctions cut off key spare parts, forcing the company to replace about 40 systems and operate an \"import-substituted\" version in 2023. Europe's aviation safety regulator withdrew the aircraft's certification, effectively banning the SJ-100 and other Russian planes from its airspace.\nIndia has long aimed to build passenger aircraft domestically but has achieved only limited success.\nIn 1959, the government set up the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) to develop \"small and medium-sized civil aircraft\".\nThe facility has developed the two-seater Hansa and five-seater trainer planes, but larger passenger aircraft remain out of reach.\nIn the 1960s, India built passenger planes under foreign licenses. State-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) produced dozens of UK-designed Avro 748 jets, used by both commercial airlines and the military before being phased out.\nIn the 1980s, India partnered with German firm Dornier to produce a 19-seat passenger jet, some of which still serve the military and limited civil routes.\nWith the momentum going, India has also tried to ingeniously design its own small passenger planes.\nIn 2000, India also signed an agreement with Russia for help in manufacturing the NAL's 15-seater Saras aircraft. The plane made its maiden flight in May 2004, but the project was stalled in 2009 after three pilots were killed during an accident involving its second prototype.\nThe project was revived by the Indian government years later with the next prototype Saras MK2, a 19-seater plane, but it is still awaiting certification.\nAnother such project, the Regional Transport Aircraft (RTA) has also seen very little progress through the years. Feasibility reports for the 90-seater, comparable to the Russian SJ-100, were submitted in 2011, with little progress since.\nAviation experts say aircraft manufacturing in India has faced hurdles for a long time now.\nDr Abhay Pashilkar, director of NAL, points that the \"lack of large domestic demand\" until recently, along with a shortage of highly skilled manpower and a small domestic manufacturing ecosystem, has held back growth in the sector.\nThe way out, he adds, is \"to engage with Indian as well as global manufacturers\".\nSo, could the SJ-100 project indeed be a game-changer?\nFor now, it appears so.\nThe plan offers a \"practical approach\" as India's own projects are nowhere near completion, says Gopal Sutar, former spokesperson of the HAL.\nFor Moscow as well, wider acceptance of the SJ-100 would prove that they could make a civil aircraft without western technology.\nWhile the deal comes with clear trade-offs and leaves questions about the future of India's aviation manufacturing ambitions, experts like Mr Sutar argue that Russia's role as a \"steadfast supporter\" of India remains key.\n\"Sanctions could pose challenges, but that would have been factored in by both countries,\" he said.\nAircraft availability is only part of India's aviation challenge; rapid expansion also hinges on trained crews.\nEarlier this month, IndiGo cancelled thousands of flights due to \"poor planning of pilot rosters,\" leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded for hours or even days.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/india-wants-more-passenger-jets-234830447.html", "published_at": "2026-01-04T23:48:30+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

That's much bigger than CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with an approximately 27 kilometer circumference – or nearly 17 miles. These systems, especially the LHC, play a huge role in studying how the universe began during the Big Bang.\nDevelopment for CEPC started in 2012, around the time CERN discovered the Higgs boson particle; however, it appears the multibillion-dollar project is now paused. It was not included in the country's next five-year plan, spanning 2026 to 2030, which means it's considered a lower priority by the state — it will see less funding and resources. Wang Yifang from the Institute of High Energy Physics confirmed the change, but although the recent proposal to be included in China's five-year plan was denied, the team plans to resubmit the CEPC proposal in 2030.\nWhile it hasn't been directly confirmed, the CEPC would cost an estimated $5.1 billion, money that the country might want to divert elsewhere. In that case, Wang says if the European Future Circular Collider (FCC) – the next-generation collider that would effectively be LHC's successor with a much larger 90.7-kilometer (or 56-mile) circumference – is approved before the 2030 proposals, they'll likely join forces with the related teams instead.\nTo summarize, China's CEPC is out, likely due to cost and resource requirements, but the European's FCC still has potential, and the Chinese physicist team may join up if the proposal is approved before the next round of China's plans.\nRead more: 12 Real-Life Inventions That Were Inspired By Science Fiction\nWhat do particle accelerators actually tell us?\nDiscoveries from the systems we have operating now, like the Higgs boson discovery at LHC, occur because of how particle accelerators actually work. They fire particles into a big tunnel, or underground rings, which circle around at incredibly fast speeds before colliding. By observing these collisions, scientists get a glimpse into what the early universe looked like, as well as other foundational elements like quarks, the building blocks of visible matter in the universe. Scientists also used the system to create quark soup, a substance that hadn't been seen for billions of years before that. Generally speaking, when two particles collide, for the infinitesimally small span of time afterwards, scientists can see traces or patterns that are otherwise invisible — that's exactly how they discovered the Higgs boson.\nThe larger colliders, like CEPC or FCC, would not only introduce larger tunnel systems but more advanced and unique equipment, to uncover heavier or different particles, many of which the LHC simply cannot create. Imagine what kind of alchemy could be achieved with the larger, more capable collider systems.\nAs the current system, the LHC is expected to be phased out by the 2040s; meanwhile, the FCC, if approved, will begin development in the 2030s. That said, construction can't start quite that easily: Before anything happens, the CERN Member States and international partners have to give the upgrade project a greenlight.\nEnjoyed this article?

This time, it has three devices to show off: the “Light Straight + Multi-styler” as well as the helpfully named LED Face Mask and LED Eye Mask.\nDon’t let the unassuming names mislead you. These three products actually harbor some unique traits. The Light Straight (and multi-styler, which I’m going to just call the Light Straight from here on), for instance, uses infrared light to help generate the heat required to style your hair. Meanwhile, the LED Face Mask is different from those made by companies like Dr. Dennis Gross, Omnilux, Therabody and Shark. Instead of fairly hard shells that sit rigidly on your face, L'Oréal’s version looks to be pliable and thin.\nI haven’t seen this in person yet, though I do intend to do so as soon as possible, but the pictures of the LED Eye Mask look, and I mean this in the best way, ridonkulous. Not only do they appear supple, but they also seem to be transparent, with bulbs and wires you can see inside. In some of the images that the company provided, the masks are completely awash in red as the lights are on. In others, only parts of it are red. One of them even shows the masks sitting in a little carrying case and they almost look like wireless earbuds. I haven’t seen any photos of the LED Face Mask but I can imagine they’d be fairly similar to these.\nAccording to the press release, this “ultra-thin, flexible silicone mask” is currently “in prototype form” and was developed in collaboration with LED solutions company iSmart. The company said this mask “delivers light directly to the face” in 10-minute automatically timed sessions. That’s not too different from existing red light masks, but L’Oréal said it believes “the key to the mask’s effectiveness is its advanced, transparent support, which integrates a skin-safe microcircuit to precisely control the emission of two selected wavelengths of light—red light (630 nm) and near-infrared light (830 nm).”\nSince the mask is only launching in 2027, there aren’t details yet on pricing and availability, though the company’s global vice president of tech and open innovation Guive Balooch told Engadget that it would be a premium product that would sit somewhere below the highest priced offerings currently out there.\nOne of my problems with full-face LED masks is that my skin always feels too parched under them, because you have to use them on clean, dry skin for 10 minutes at a time. Balooch told me that L'Oréal would have a serum developed to be used with its mask that would help with that, while also improving the effectiveness of the light treatment.\nThat certainly is intriguing, and Balooch indicated that creating formulations that are designed to work with devices like the LED masks is a future direction for the company.\nI’m also interested in the Light Straight, which like the company’s AirLight Pro uses infrared light to help dry or style hair. According to the company’s press release, hair straighteners with “ordinary heating places can reach temperatures of 400°F and higher—above the threshold at which keratin denatures, leading to weakened cuticles, breakage and reduced shine.” For context, I used to turn my flatiron all the way up to 425 degrees Fahrenheit to tame my tresses (though these days I find a more reasonable 330 degrees is good enough).\nL’Oréal says the Light Straight and its “patented infrared light technology” can “help provide exceptional styling results at lower temperatures, to better protect the health of the hair.” The device’s glass plates never exceed 320 degrees, and the company says its testing found that the Light Straight is three times faster and leaves hair twice as smooth as “leading premium hair stylers.” I’m not sure how you would quantify smoothness, but I’m hopeful the results do pan out in the real world.\nThe Light Straight uses near-infrared light that L’Oréal says “penetrates deeply into hair fibers” to “reshape internal hydrogen bonds.” It also has sensors onboard with “built-in proprietary algorithms and machine learning” to adapt to your gestures “to maximize individual experience.” I’m not sure what that means, but I hope to find out more this week at CES. Given the Light Straight doesn’t launch till 2027, it’s not surprising that pricing and other details aren’t yet available. But for now, I’m keen to see companies continue to investigate novel, hopefully healthier ways for us to look and feel beautiful.", "url": "https://tech.yahoo.com/general/article/lor-al-ces-2026-beauty-070000979.html", "published_at": "2026-01-05T07:00:00+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

But scientists say that illusion is cracking.\nWhat's happening?\nOn Mount Kenya, one of Africa's most iconic natural landmarks, ancient glaciers are shrinking so fast that experts have warned they can vanish entirely within just a few years.\nLewis Pugh, a United Nations Environment Program goodwill ambassador, climbed Mount Kenya's highest peak in December to visit the Lewis Glacier.

Click your choice to see results and speak your mind. |\nAs ice disappears around the world — including in the Arctic — sea levels rise, pushing higher tides into coastal neighborhoods during storms. That flooding damages homes, disrupts ports, and threatens food systems that depend on stable shipping and fertile land.\nExtreme weather has always existed, but scientists agree that human-caused warming acts like steroids for storms, floods, and heat waves — making them stronger, longer-lasting, and more destructive.\nWhat's being done about it?\nGlobally, researchers and advocates are pushing for faster reductions in pollution that trap heat in the atmosphere. Some governments are expanding clean energy and protecting water sources tied to melting ice.\nThere are also many ways to help on an individual level. Using less energy at home, supporting clean transportation, cutting food waste, and staying informed about critical environmental issues all reduce the pressure driving ice loss worldwide.\nMore in Science\nThe glaciers on Mount Kenya may be small, but their message is loud: the systems that keep communities stable are more fragile than they look — and they need attention now, not later.\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/experts-sound-alarm-iconic-natural-031500707.html", "published_at": "2026-01-05T03:15:00+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

They also razed down the local market and several houses, state police spokesman Wasiu Abiodun said in a statement.\nAt least two residents put the death toll at 37 and said it could be much higher as some people remained missing as of Sunday. Locals also said the security forces are yet to arrive in the area, contradicting a police claim that they have deployed officers to search for those kidnapped.\nRev. Fr. Stephen Kabirat, a spokesman for the Catholic Church of Kontagora Diocese where the attack happened, told local media that the gunmen killed more than 40 people and abducted several others, including children.\nNigeria’s President Bola Tinubu condemned the attack and said he has directed security officials to hunt down the gunmen and rescue the hostages.\n“These terrorists have tested the resolve of our country and its people,” Tinubu said in a statement. “They must face the full consequences of their criminal actions. No matter who they are or what their intent is, they must be hunted down. In addition, those who aid, abet, or enable them will also be brought to justice.”\nThe gunmen had been lurking around nearby communities for about a week before the attack, according to one resident who asked not to be named for fear of his safety.

With co-located production, VIVE-backed third-party certifications, Hyosung TNC is targeting a 2026 production start and 2027 retail debut—aiming for up to a 55% lower carbon footprint while meeting performance demands across activewear, intimates and denim.\nHyosung TNC recently won three awards in the 2025 Just Style Excellence Awards.\nJust Style (JS):Congratulations on winning in the 2025 Just Style Excellence Awards. How do these three awards align with Hyosung TNC’s long-term vision for elastane and adjacent sectors?\nSimon Whitmarsh-Knight: Thank you! We are very proud that our regen™ BIO Elastane was recognized as a triple-category award winner in the 2025 Just Style Excellence Awards! These prestigious awards validate our corporate goal for investing in, and developing this innovative fiber. Together with other investments in pioneering textile technologies, we are supporting the industry’s move to more circular business models and our corporate goal to be carbon neutral by 2050.\nJS:What early strategic choices proved critical to moving bio-based elastane from concept toward scale?\nSimon Whitmarsh-Knight: Hyosung TNC prides itself on being a total sustainable textile solution provider. We introduced RCS-certified 100% recycled elastane into the marketplace in 2020. Beyond recycled elastane, we saw an opportunity to develop a bio-based option for brands and retailers looking for a plant-based elastane to blend with its natural fibers such as cotton, wool, silk and cellulosic materials, in addition to other synthetic fibers. In 2022, we introduced SGS EEPS and USDA-certified regen™ Bio Elastane made with 30% renewable content from corn, and in 2023, we introduced an expanded regen™ BIO-Based elastane offering to include various options for the yarn to be made with a higher content of renewable resources.\nIn 2024, our $1 billion investment in a bio-BDO facility in Vietnam marked a turning point in sustainable stretch innovation. By pioneering the use of sugarcane-derived bio-BDO, one of the ingredients in elastane, we’ve brought bio-based stretch fibers out of the lab and into full-scale production. This breakthrough tackles elastane’s highest carbon emission stage by substituting fossil-fuel based raw materials with a renewable-based alternative.\nIn partnership with Geno, whose biotechnology ferments sugars from sugarcane to allow us to create the bio-BDO, we’re providing a drop-in solution that fits seamlessly into existing elastane manufacturing—proving sustainability can scale. Looking ahead, Hyosung TNC is also pursuing a roadmap to recycle in-house waste generated during regen™ Bio Spandex production to create Recycled Spandex, thereby establishing a fully circular system that connects bio-based production to recycling.\nJS:Why did you choose sugarcane-derived bio-BDO and partner with Geno?\nSimon Whitmarsh-Knight: Selecting sugarcane as the feedstock reduces processing steps compared with alternatives like corn, which require conversion from starch to glucose before fermentation. Fewer steps generally mean less energy use and lower associated emissions.\nFollowing significant market research, we partnered with Geno due to their expertise in biotechnology, accelerating the world’s transformation to sustainable materials by replacing fossil fuel resources with plant-based alternatives. For more than two decades, Geno has been scaling technology to enable the production of sustainable materials derived from plant- or waste-based feedstocks instead of fossil fuel-based materials.\nJS:How does co-locating bio-BDO and elastane production in Vietnam change your operating model from R&D through delivery?\nSimon Whitmarsh-Knight: Through this vertical integration from raw material to yarn for regen™ BIO Elastane, our goal is to increase production efficiency, provide faster response to our customer needs, and integrate value chains to help minimize carbon footprint. Global sourcing patterns are constantly evolving, and as the only elastane manufacturer in Vietnam, we are well placed to serve our customers looking for alternative value chains.\nJS:What are the key milestones to commercial rollout through 2027, and how are you de-risking each phase?\nSimon Whitmarsh-Knight: The investment is structured around clear milestones: plant upgrades in Q3–Q4 2025, bio-BDO production beginning in Q1 2026, biobased elastane production in Q2 2026, and apparel using this elastane expected in stores from 2027. This timeline signals execution discipline and allows supply chain partners—mills, vendors, and brands—to plan fiber development, testing, and commercialization in step with material availability.\nJS:How are you validating performance parity for demanding categories like activewear, intimates, and denim?\nSimon Whitmarsh-Knight: As always before launching products at scale, we conducted rigorous testing with our global mill partners, covering circular knit, warp knit, seamless and wovens. This was followed by extensive wearer trials and garment testing. In addition, we’ve pursued third-party certifications and traceability for bio-based content, referencing programs such as USDA Bio-Preferred, SGS EEPS, and ASTM D6866 testing. This transparency enables brand partners to communicate inputs with confidence through to consumer-facing claims.\nJS:Beyond certifications, what proof do brand partners most often request, and how do you provide it?\nSimon Whitmarsh-Knight: Many want to know about the traceability of the feedstock. As a result, we’ve joined the VIVE Sustainable Supply Program, to ensure a high level of traceability and transparency from sugarcane farms to fiber production. The VIVE Programme is a globally recognized continuous improvement sustainability program for commodity supply chains, covering all operations and activities for producers through to end users that have a bearing on sustainability. VIVE is a verification platform that has been benchmarked to various certification programs, global standards and industrial buyer criteria.\nJS:How will the Life Cycle Assessment inform decisions on energy, water, and logistics once the plant is operational?\nSimon Whitmarsh-Knight: Hyosung TNC has established a vertically integrated production system in Vietnam, enhancing efficiency and minimizing transportation distances to reduce environmental impacts such as carbon emissions, energy consumption, and water use.\nThe company ensures the sustainability of its products and raw materials through certification and verification systems, and continues to make ongoing improvements. Through these initiatives, Hyosung TNC expects up to a 55% reduction (internal estimate) in carbon emissions compared to regular elastane, along with improvements across other environmental impact areas including water use. A full third-party LCA will be conducted once the plant is operational.\nJS:How are you engaging mills and brands to align development and testing timelines with your production ramp-up?\nSimon Whitmarsh-Knight: We are working closely with our global brand and retail partners to support their transition to the new product derived from sugarcane. We have shared the key milestones and selected customers have also visited the upgraded facility in Vietnam. Together, we’re collaborating to ensure (i) an effective transition and (ii) clear communication of the benefits to their end-consumers.\nJS:What commercial models or incentives are helping customers transition from fossil-based to bio-based elastane?\nSimon Whitmarsh-Knight: Regulations are one of the key short-time drivers of behavior change. The biggest incentive is the European Green Deal (EUGD) regulation to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels. Supported by this incoming legislation, brands and retailers are looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprints through responsible materials, such as recycled fabrics or materials made with bio-derived resources.\nJS:Where is near-term demand for bio-BDO strongest beyond apparel, and how are you structuring cross-sector collaborations?\nSimon Whitmarsh-Knight: Ultimately, the investment extends beyond apparel, as bio-BDO can also serve the footwear, packaging, and automotive markets. This broader impact helps advance renewable materials across industries and highlights the company’s role in building sustainable infrastructure, not just expanding production. We’re working across the Hyosung group to provide efficient supplies across all of our customers.\nJS:If you could align the industry around one shared priority for the next three years, what would it be and why?\nSimon Whitmarsh-Knight: Collaboration. The systemic problems we face as an industry are too complex for any one company to solve on their own. The only way we can make significant impact is through collaborating at all levels across the value system to unlock real progress.\nJS: Simon, thank you for the clear roadmap. Your move to vertically integrate sugarcane-derived bio-BDO and elastane in Vietnam, paired with transparent verification and cross-sector applications, offers a pragmatic template for scaling low-carbon stretch. We look forward to tracking the 2026 ramp and how your closed-loop ambitions around recycled spandex advance true circularity.\nAbout Simon Whitmarsh-Knight\nSimon has extensive international experience growing new business in sustainable fibers, technical textiles and performance apparel. Having worked for global brands, retailers and manufacturers, Simon’s background includes building brands and aligning teams across cultures in dynamic markets, and supporting supply chain transformation through the textiles value system.

And why are there no comments about the international law violations by the Iranian regime as it cracks down on protesters?\n\"Starmer’s silence on Iran is shocking,” the UK’s Shadow Foreign Secretary Priti Patel opined on Saturday, referring to a dramatic absence of commentary from British politicians and British media regarding the weeklong anti-regime protests in Iran.\n“With Iran’s cruel authoritarian regime emboldened by its brutal crackdown of freedom and democracy advocates within the country, Britain stands in silence as we see the chilling images of protesters being silenced and young activists being detained,” she added.\n“All this is not happening in secret but in plain sight, which is why the lack of robust action and condemnation by Starmer’s feeble government is shocking. Senior figures in the Labour Government seem unwilling and incapable of stepping up.”\nMass demonstrations broke out across Iran on December 28, with citizens protesting over the collapse of the rial and soaring inflation, as well as dissatisfaction with the Islamic regime.\nThese are the largest anti-regime protests since 2022’s Mahsa Amini protests. And yet there have been no tweets from Prime Minister Keir Starmer nor Yvette Cooper showing solidarity with the Iranian people or condemning the brutal Islamic regime's crackdown on protests.\nThe BBC – the country’s state broadcaster – has only published four articles. If one were relying on the BBC for coverage, one could be forgiven for not knowing anything was happening in Iran at all. A large group of Iranian and Jewish protesters actually gathered outside the BBC HQ on Sunday, chanting, “Ayatollah BBC, shame on you.”\nYet when there is any development in Israel or Palestine, Cooper, David Lammy, and Starmer – and of course the BBC – scramble to chime in.\nAnd it’s not just the BBC. The Guardian, which has dedicated itself to the noble task of Israel-bashing, focused its coverage on an op-ed by Iran’s foreign ministerAbbas Araghchi about how “Israel’s recklessness is a threat to all.”\nThe Jerusalem Post has seen countless images on Iranian citizen Telegram channels and X/Twitter accounts showing horrific injuries, including an X-ray of a woman with hundreds of metal bearings in her skull. Yet, according to The Guardian, Israel is the greatest threat.\nSo why the silence?\nOne reason could be that British politicians and British media view Iran’s internal issues abstractly, whereas the Israel-Palestine conflict is seen as somewhat symbiotic with British history and policy and therefore of domestic importance. The last two years have shown that Israel-Palestine developments have a strong impact on British domestic policy and are treated as a Westminster issue.\nIranian internal struggles, on the other hand, are regarded at a distance. The UK sometimes takes the side of quiet diplomacy, fearing that any public condemnation of internal Iranian affairs may jeopardize any future negotiations.\nSome have said that British politicians are playing a waiting game, fearful to chip in before more is clear. Others argued that they do not want to comment on foreign regime changes. However, this argument does not stand up to scrutiny.\nAfter the US’s capture and indictment of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, Starmer and Cooper both immediately came out with statements about endorsing “transition of power” in Venezuela, so long as it is with respect to international law. Why is there no statement about supporting regime change in Iran? And why are there no comments about the international law violations by the Iranian regime as it cracks down on protesters?\nMore in World\nThe BBC has given some dubious reasons for its lack of coverage. BBC World Affairs reporter John Simpson responded to queries by saying it is “very difficult for news organizations to get correspondents in [Iran]. The BBC is banned, and so are most others. It’s a bit like Gaza.”\nNot being able to enter Gaza has not stopped the BBC from writing incessantly about it over the last two years, so why this would be a barrier to covering Iran is unclear.\n“Understood, but BBC can report on the tide of social media posts, many of which are obviously authentic – but the total blackout on the story is absolutely astounding and irresponsible,” retorted historian Simon Schama, highlighting the double standards.\nThe National Union for Democracy in Iran – which delivered a groundbreaking report on Iran’s web of influence in the UK last year – magnanimously offered to help the BBC with its coverage. “We are analyzing, monitoring, verifying, and translating protest videos and slogans on a daily basis. We are happy to help.”If the Islamic Republic falls, it will change the future of not just the Iranian people but the entire world. Regardless of the outcome, the UK will be directly affected. Surely the BBC wants to be leading the tide of reporting on this? Surely Britain’s government wants to preemptively assure the Iranian people of its support, should the regime fall.\nThe Iranian people are asking to be heard. The question remains of why key British establishments are choosing not to give them a voice.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/britain-silence-iran-protests-says-002439017.html", "published_at": "2026-01-05T00:24:39+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Moments later, roughly 700 workers continue making their armored vehicles bound for Japan, Sweden, Slovakia, and other countries. The blast is not a test-firing of its new combat vehicle, but part of the construction for its expanding manufacturing facility.\nPatria, Finland's largest defense company, is planning to nearly double production at its main hub just north of Helsinki, clearing rocks with explosives on-site to make way for several new assembly lines.\nThe Hämeenlinna factory manufactures Patria's 8×8 armored personnel carrier and a relatively new, up-and-coming vehicle: a wheeled 6×6 troop transport that's receiving surging demand from northern and western Europe.\nWork on the 25-foot-long, 17-ton vehicle began in 2020 under a joint program between Finland and Latvia called the Common Armored Vehicles System. Both countries sought a cost-effective, mass-produced armored vehicle that could be used by their militaries for interoperability.\nLatvia has since sent at least 42 of these vehicles to Ukraine, armed with heavy machine guns and rolled out in batches over the last year. The vehicle can cross tundra and even rivers while shielding up to 10 troops it carries from land mines and artillery fire to get them to forward positions.\nWhen Business Insider visited Patria's factory, representatives for the company — which is majority-owned by the state of Finland — said the firm wasn't authorized to share details about the 6×6's performance in Ukraine.\nBut the CAVS 6×6 program has been quickly drawing attention from the rest of Europe: What began as a partnership between two countries has expanded into a consortium of seven member states.\nSweden joined the Common Armored Vehicles System program in 2022, followed by Germany, Denmark, the UK, and Norway in subsequent years.\nMore in World\nFinland and Latvia have placed orders for just under 500 of these vehicles, while Sweden has requested 415 of the 6×6s to be delivered over the next five years. Stockholm's latest order for 94 vehicles, announced in early December, priced each one at about $1.75 million.\nGermany has become the program's largest buyer, signing contracts in mid-December to acquire 876 of the 6×6 vehicles, valued at $2.3 billion. These vehicles will be split into four variants, including one that features a mortar turret.\nMeanwhile, Denmark, which joined the program this year, has already placed an order for 129 6×6 vehicles.\nThe UK and Norway are still negotiating 6×6 orders with Patria.\nInside the CAVS 6×6\nThe CAVS 6×6 can accommodate roughly 10 troops, along with a typical crew of two or three, and features up to NATO standard level 4 armor designed to withstand direct hits from large-caliber machine gun fire, mine explosions, and nearby artillery blasts.\nThe CAVS 6×6 competes with other wheeled troop transports, such as Rheinmetall's Boxer and General Dynamics Land Systems' Stryker, the latter of which is extensively fielded by the US Army.\nThe Finnish company said it can tweak the vehicle for each customer's needs, but a typical model features climate control that enables the vehicle to operate in temperatures as low as -40°F.\n\"Inside, it will be comfortable enough to easily survive. We are talking about temperatures of the plus centigrades,\" Mikko Rantanen, Patria's director for 6×6 vehicle programs, told Business Insider from inside the rear compartment of one of the vehicles.\nThe 6×6's rear interior is spartan: Cloth-covered metal-frame seats and headrests for five people on either side, with space behind each seat for equipment and small arms.\nThere's just enough room for a soldier to sit with their knees touching the opposite passenger's. A few fire extinguishers inside are connected to an automatic suppression system that can detect a blaze in the rear cabin.\nScreens allow troops to see outside the vehicle through exterior cameras, while a rear hatch provides the option of fitting a machine gun or crewed weapon module on top of the 6×6.\nOn the right-hand side of the vehicle, a small passageway also lets troops pass between the rear compartment and the driver's cabin, which resembles that of a truck and features an automatic gearbox.\nOptional propellers on the 6×6's underside enable it to transition seamlessly from traversing land to crossing small bodies of water, such as rivers or lakes.\n\"We can enter the water without needing preparation in this configuration,\" said Rantanen.\nHowever, the 6×6's speed in the water is just under 5 mph, and Rantanen added that it's not meant to be a landing craft or amphibious assault vehicle.\nOn land, it's designed to drive at speeds of over 60 mph, easily cross trenches that are four feet wide, and surmount obstacles about two feet high.\nMoving fast in the Arctic\nBuilding weapons and vehicles specifically for arctic terrain is a specialty for contractors in Finland, a country renowned for holding off the Soviet Union for over 100 days in deep snow and dense forest during World War II.\nPatria said that while the 6×6 can be outfitted for various terrain types, including the desert, the arctic domain is its forte.\nSnow isn't the only challenge in arctic warfare. Few roads are available on Finland's border with Russia — the priority threat for NATO — and its vast hinterland is peppered with thousands of small lakes and marshland that can bog down armored transport.\n\"In the wintertime, it's snow,\" said Petri Hepola, Patria's executive vice president for sales and marketing and its chief program officer for the F-35. \"In the summer, lots of wet soil and swampy areas. One of the most important features is how fast you can move your troops and tools through these areas.\"\nFinland and Norway are the only two members of Patria's 6×6 program that share Arctic borders with Russia.\nHowever, as northern Europe, especially the Baltic and Nordic states, grows increasingly concerned about conflict with Moscow, the Kremlin has been bolstering its military presence in the high north, repopulating key bases and transforming its Arctic fleet into a separate strategic theater.\nSince Finland joined NATO in 2023, alliance forces have been rushing to train on the country's terrain and frigid temperatures, making it one of the most active spots for joint exercises in recent years.\n\"Our products have been surviving very well in that environment,\" Hepola said.\nGearing up for 2027\nWith an order backlog of nearly 2,000 6×6 vehicles, Patria hopes its new facility in Hämeenlinna will be ready for production by 2027. The factory campus serves only the tail end of the entire manufacturing cycle, which can take weeks in most cases, or several months for more complicated variants.\nInside, hundreds of workers conduct welding, surface treatment, assembly, tests, and other final processes that can each take weeks to complete.

She served four six-year terms after first being appointed in June 2001, after winning both party nominations in the 2001 primary, to fill a seat that had been vacant for some time.\nChristine Rush succeeds Mack as the ward's district judge after earning the Democratic nomination in the May 2025 primary and running unopposed in the general election.\nBuilding connections and representing Erie\nMack came to the local courts — with a dieffenbachia plant that she continued to grow, propagate and share from her office over the entirety of her career — from Serenity Hall-Crossroads, a treatment facility for adults, where she served 10 years as executive director.\nAmong the accomplishments Mack is most proud of as district judge is her involvement in a juvenile diversion program that she believes diverted over 1,000 youth from the criminal justice system, and a diversion program for those which chemical dependency issues that provides help and assistance rather than costs and fines.\n\"One of my proudest moments is when someone left me their card. The person became a recovery specialist, and said you may not remember me, but if our paths hadn't crossed I wouldn't be here today,\" Mack said.\nMack also highlighted her involvement in the Home Chore Program, where the Bayfront East Side Taskforce, city code enforcement, Erie County Adult Probation and others helped property owners with code enforcement issues by providing volunteers to address some of their needs. The program also provided dumpsters twice a year for residents in the ward to drop off large items before the city started its large item collection program, she said.\nOne way of serving youth that Mack said she didn't anticipate being as significant as it was when she first became district judge was truancy. When she first started, there were six schools in her ward, Mack said, \"and I found out really quickly truancy was going to be a big issue.\"\nShe said she began working early on with local providers to match parents and students with the services they needed so the students would attend school. That has grown to what Mack said is now the most comprehensive approach she has seen to truancy, as so many agencies and organizations are working together to address school attendance.\nMack said she became involved in a wide variety of community service organizations while a district judge, noting that at one time she sat on 17 advisory boards and committees. She also served Erie County on a statewide level as president in 2016-2017 of the Special Court Judges Association of Pennsylvania,\nMore in U.S.\nNow that she is retired, Mack said she is looking forward to spending more time with her three grandchildren, who live nearby.\nShe'll miss the people the most, Mack said, including a competent and dedicated office staff she said she was blessed to have.\n\"Feeling good that you actually made a difference,\" she said. \"I've made some lifelong friends, other district judges, people I've encountered over time.\"\nContact Tim Hahn at thahn@usatodayco.com.\nThis article originally appeared on Erie Times-News: Erie 1st Ward District Judge Sue Mack retires", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/retiring-district-judge-sue-mack-090541144.html", "published_at": "2026-01-05T09:05:41+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Political tension, rising costs, and exchange rate concerns are pushing travelers to look elsewhere. Instead of staying put, many are treating this moment as a chance to explore new places.\nSurveys show a clear change in behavior over the past year. A growing share of snowbirds now plans to winter outside the United States, nearly doubling from the year before. While the U.S. still attracts many visitors, its hold on winter travelers is slowly loosening.\nWhy snowbirds are skipping the United States\nThe shift is not about a single issue, but rather a combination of everyday concerns. Rising insurance fees, higher condo costs, and an unfavorable exchange rate have made long stays more expensive. Some travelers also say the political climate has changed the social feel in places they once loved.\nOthers are simply taking a wait-and-see approach. Many snowbirds have not sold their U.S. properties, but they are choosing short trips elsewhere for now. This flexibility allows them to explore without making long-term commitments.\nPortugal’s growing appeal\nPortugal has become one of the most talked-about alternatives for winter stays. Real estate prices have risen, but many buyers still see strong value compared to U.S. markets. The country offers mild winters, walkable cities, and a relaxed pace that appeals to long-term visitors.\nCanadian interest in Portugal has surged over the past year. Some travelers are buying property, while others are renting and exploring different regions first. This slower approach helps snowbirds decide if the lifestyle fits before settling in.\nMexico is a familiar but flexible option\nMexico continues to draw snowbirds who want warmth without long flights. Coastal cities like Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlán, and Los Cabos offer strong communities and established services. Many travelers also find daily living costs more predictable than in the United States.\nRealtors report a noticeable rise in Canadian inquiries. Some buyers are cautious, but interest remains steady despite economic concerns. For many, Mexico feels familiar while still offering a clear break from U.S. routines.\nCosta Rica and Spain gain momentum\nCosta Rica appeals to snowbirds who value nature and slower living. Its stable infrastructure and focus on outdoor life make it attractive for extended stays. Many travelers choose short-term rentals while exploring different regions.\nSpain is also gaining attention, especially along the Mediterranean coast. Winters are cooler than Florida's, but the trade-off often feels worth it. Food, public transport, and healthcare access play a big role in its appeal.\nWhat this trend means going forward\nMost snowbirds are not closing the door on the United States forever. Many say they would return if conditions improved or costs stabilized. For now, they are using this time to broaden their travel habits.\nThis shift is less about rejection and more about choice. Snowbirds are discovering that winter does not have to look the same every year.

{"article_id": "ed64d07595ecebe0", "source": "yahoo", "headline": "How community solar turned a Superfund site into savings in Illinois", "body": "", "content": "How community solar turned a Superfund site into savings in Illinois\nAs someone who spent several years as a workers’ rights organizer, Fredy Amador is intimately familiar with the financial struggles people face in the current economy. Northern Illinois’ skyrocketing energy bills make the situation even tougher.\nNow, Amador has become an evangelist for something that can provide a modest measure of relief: a community solar project, built on a Superfund site too polluted for much else in the city of Waukegan where he lives, about 40 miles north of Chicago.\nResidents who subscribe to get energy from the solar farm are guaranteed to see savings on their energy bills, under a state program incentivizing solar in low-income areas.\nThe 9.1-megawatt Yeoman Solar Project, which went online last month, can provide energy for about 1,000 households, as well as the Waukegan school district, which owns the land.\nThe school district bought the site in the 1950s hoping to build a new high school. But the land proved too swampy, and from 1958 to 1969 it was used as a dump for industrial and municipal waste. The highly contaminated Yeoman Creek Landfill was finally cleaned up 20 years ago, and now the district receives lease payments from CleanCapital, the national solar-investment company that owns and operates the solar farm.\nSuch brownfields are attractive locations for solar installations because of “existing electrical infrastructure, lower-cost land, and community acceptance,” noted Paul Curran, CleanCapital’s chief development officer. Incentives from the state initiative Illinois Solar for All helped make the project financially viable, even given extra costs incurred from building on a Superfund site.\nIt’s an example of how state policy can drive clean energy development and cost savings, even as federal tax credits for solar are being cut. The project also shows how solar can turn a community liability into an asset.\n“The Yeoman Solar Project encapsulates so much of solar’s promise,” said Andrew Linhares, senior manager for the central U.S. at the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. “The project instills new life into the Yeoman Creek Landfill Superfund site like only solar can.”\nBuilding on pollution\nAs an unlined pit amid wetlands, the Yeoman Creek Landfill leached toxic chemicals into the environment, including its namesake creek. In 1989, the landfill was added to the Superfund list, the federal program that requires companies responsible for pollution to clean it up.\nThe remediation was completed in 2005, though gas release, groundwater, and sediment are still being monitored.\n“Since then, it’s been vacant,” and discussions started in 2012 regarding the fate of the land, said LeBaron Moten, deputy superintendent of Waukegan Community Unit School District No. 60.\n“There were not too many options on the table for this specific site. We couldn’t build anything on it,” Moten said. “Our main objective was to keep people off it.”\nMore in U.S.\nRepresentatives of the school district, the city, and the group of companies involved in the cleanup decided to pursue putting a solar farm on the site, and in 2017 the school district issued a request for proposals. A national developer experienced in building solar on landfills, BQ Energy, was selected. In 2022, it was acquired by CleanCapital, which launched construction of the project.\nMoten said the lease payments from CleanCapital and the energy savings from solar power will be helpful for the district, which serves over 13,000 students, the majority of whom are Latino and 68% of whom are considered low-income. The school district will be the project’s anchor tenant, using about 40% of the energy produced.\nSeven of the school district’s buildings have rooftop solar arrays, which are referenced in sustainability lessons in the classroom. Moten said he hopes Yeoman Solar will similarly factor into educating students about clean energy, and potentially preparing them for jobs in the industry.\nA new direction brings new challenges\nA longtime industrial hub, Waukegan is home to five Superfund sites. The city still has a lot of manufacturing, and until 2022 a large coal plant operated on the shore of Lake Michigan, not far from residents’ homes. That location remains contaminated with toxic coal ash. The community organization Clean Power Lake County and local activists have long demanded a just transition for Waukegan, in which economic opportunities and renewable energy benefit residents who have suffered from pollution.\nInstalling solar on brownfields is one way to accomplish this.\nSolar is a good fit for sites that are too polluted for housing or other types of development, noted Curran. Under the terms of the Superfund remediation, residential use is prohibited at the Yeoman Creek site.\nBut installing arrays on landfills or other remediated areas does entail some challenges.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reviews solar developers' plans for Superfund sites, Curran said, to be sure the construction won't damage caps over contaminated soil or otherwise release pollutants. The EPA examines “every single step of construction from how big ballasts can be, to stormwater protection, to how we’re going to revegetate,” he added.\nEven mowing the grass below solar panels — a normally mundane process — can pose risks when a landfill lies underneath.\n“The lawn is basically what’s holding the land in place, so you don’t get erosion,” Curran said.\nAn Illinois law passed in October and awaiting the governor’s signature creates a rebate for community solar paired with battery storage. Curran said that batteries would likely be too heavy to locate on a landfill, but CleanCapital may explore putting them on firmer ground nearby.\nThe company has developed solar on brownfields and landfills in other states, including a new 822-kilowatt site in Maryland. Curran said community solar should be built on more of the nation’s thousands of closed landfills.\nPolicies like those in Illinois help facilitate the process. A 2017 law created robust incentives for community solar. Since then, more than 700 community solar projects totaling over 1,800 megawatts have been built through the Illinois Shines incentive program. Another 33 projects representing 64 megawatts have been subsidized by Illinois Solar for All, a program for low-income and environmental justice areas (separate from the federal program of the same name that was ended by the Trump administration).\nThe Illinois Power Agency, which acquires power on behalf of utilities, procures solar built on brownfields. The Illinois EPA also provides low-interest loans and other resources for brownfield redevelopment.\nA shared resource\nAmador found out about Yeoman Solar from local clean energy leaders after he helped launch a Waukegan branch of the Chicago Workers Collaborative, which organizes and advocates for temporary workers. (He is no longer with the group, though he still lives in Waukegan.)\nCommunity solar makes clean energy accessible to people who can’t or don’t want to install solar on their own homes — like Amador himself.\n“I live in a condo building, and if I bought a house I probably would not have solar panels. I don’t like how they look on rooftops,” he said.\nHe often gets the same reaction when he tells people about community solar. “At first they think I’m talking about installing solar on their homes — they don’t want that.”\nBut after explaining and extolling the community solar model, Amador has recruited dozens of family, friends, and members of his church to subscribe to Yeoman Solar.\n“It will help their wallet and help the ecosystem too,” Amador said.\nThe Yeoman Solar subscriptions will cover more than 90% of a household’s energy needs, said Ryan Libby, director of subscriber acquisition for PowerMarket, which CleanCapital contracted to recruit subscribers. Amador expects to save about $300 a year through his subscription, which equates to about 5 kilowatts of solar panels.\n“That money can pay for utilities, for food, for other bills,” Amador said. “With how bad this economy is, it’s an important impact.”\nYeoman Solar is the largest community solar array in the territory of ComEd, the utility that serves northern Illinois. It reduces the amount of energy the utility needs to provide, and ComEd has praised the project. While any ComEd customer can subscribe, Curran said CleanCapital is prioritizing outreach to Waukegan residents.\nAmador indeed feels it represents a new path for the city.\n“All the pollution, the coal plant, the disinvestment — communities like Waukegan should be prioritized for projects like this,” he said. “I’d like to encourage people to ask questions — go to meetings, find out how these projects work, try to sign up. That will help them to save some money, and if we all participate, we’re stronger.”\nWe’re glad you read this story.

He posted a meme mocking Maduro after his capture Saturday, but expressed none of the jubilation seen from regional counterparts.\nIn Bolivia, where old anti-American dogmas die hard due to memories of the bloody U.S.-backed war on drugs, new conservative President Rodrigo Paz praised Maduro’s removal insomuch as it fulfilled “the true popular will” of Venezuelans who tried to vote the autocrat out of office in a 2024 election widely seen as fraudulent.\n“Bolivia reaffirms that the way out for Venezuela is to respect the vote,” Paz said.\nHis message didn't age well. Hours later, Trump announced he would work with Maduro's loyalist vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, rather than the opposition that prevailed in the 2024 election.\n“The Trump administration, it appears at this point, is making decisions about the democratic future of Venezuela without referring back to the democratic result,\" said Kevin Whitaker, former deputy chief of mission for the State Department in Caracas.\nWhen asked Sunday about when Venezuela will hold democratic elections, Trump responded: “I think we’re looking more at getting it fixed.”\nAs the right rises, Trump puts enemies on notice\nThe Trump administration’s attack on Venezuela extends its broader crusade to assemble a column of allied — or at least acquiescent — governments in Latin America, sailing with the political winds blowing in much of the region.\nRecent presidential elections from Chile to Honduras have elevated tough, Trump-like leaders who oppose immigration, prioritize security and promise a return to better, bygone eras free of globalization and “wokeness.”\n“The president is going to be looking for allied and partner nations in the hemisphere who share his kind of broader ideological affinity,” said Alexander Gray, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington research institute.\nThose who don't share that ideology were put on notice this weekend. Trump said Cuba’s Communist government “looks like it’s ready to fall.” He slammed Sheinbaum’s failure to root out Mexican cartels, saying that “something’s going to have to be done with Mexico.” He repeated allegations that Petro “likes making cocaine” and warned that “he's not going to be doing it very long.\"\n“We’re in the business of having countries around us that are viable and successful, where the oil is allowed to really come out,\" he told reporters Sunday on Air Force One. “It's our hemisphere.”\n___\nDeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

State Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, were also shot and wounded in their home the same day.\nVance Boelter of Minnesota is accused of the shootings. The manhunt to arrest Boelter was the largest in Minnesota history. He was indicted on federal murder charges in July and pleaded not guilty in August.\nTrump shared the video — which seems to have been made by another social media user, who shared yet another video — on Saturday. It made unsubstantiated claims tying Walz and alleged fraud in Minnesota’s state programs to the murders. There has been no evidence to suggest there is such a link.\nOn Saturday, Walz — who was the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024 — called Trump’s post “dangerous, depraved behavior from the sitting president of the United States,” saying he would “get more innocent people killed.”\n“America is better than this,” Walz said.\nOn Sunday, the Hortmans’ children, Colin and Sophie, each released statements condemning the video.\n“I am asking President Trump to remove the video that he shared and apologize to me and my family for posting this misinformation and for using my mother’s own words to dishonor her memory,” Colin Hortman wrote.\nSophie Hortman echoed the sentiment, calling the video “a painful, false twisting of my mother’s final vote.”\n“We must create a society in which we do not harbor hatred and violence toward our political opponents, and this video promotes a false narrative which fuels the flames of political division,” Sophie Hortman wrote.\n“The video being shared by the president is another hurdle our family must overcome in grieving the loss of my parents, Mark and Melissa, and their beloved [dog] Gilbert,” she added. “I ask President Trump to please consider the pain and sadness we have faced, and to honor the spirit of the holidays we have just spent without our parents by taking down the post on Truth Social.”\nThe Hoffman family said in a statement that it \"stands with Sophie and Colin Hortman.\"\nMore in U.S.\n\"We ask President Trump to take down the post spreading conspiracy claims about their parents’ deaths,\" the family said in a statement. \"Those claims reflect the same hateful falsehoods that motivated violence and cause more harm.\"\n\"This moment calls for responsibility and compassion. Removing the post would be a necessary step toward decency,\" the family said.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Hortman children’s statements or to inquiries about why Trump shared the video.\nTrump shared the video as his administration has seized on viral allegations of fraud in some Minnesota state programs in recent weeks.\nThe Justice Department has investigated allegations of fraud in Minnesota for a few years. One investigation involved the nonprofit group Feeding Our Future and has netted, since 2022, criminal charges for more than 70 people so far — some of whom are members of the state’s Somali community.\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/slain-minnesota-lawmakers-children-call-025433147.html", "published_at": "2026-01-05T02:54:33+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}
{"article_id": "561a4b524a4245bd", "source": "yahoo", "headline": "26 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2026", "body": "", "content": "I have a New Year's tradition. It doesn't involve fireworks or eating certain foods. Instead, in the first week of January, I identify my top dividend stocks to buy and hold for the new year.\nMany of the stocks on this year's list are repeats from 2025, but there are also a few new entrants. Without further ado, here are my 26 top dividend stocks to buy and hold in 2026.\nDividend royalty\nLet's start with the Dividend Kings, an elite group of stocks that have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years. I like three members of the dividend royalty for 2026:\nMultinational beverage maker with 30 billion-dollar brands\n$301 billion\n2.9%\n3. Walmart(NASDAQ: WMT)\nLarge retailer with stores in the U.S. and other countries\n$888 billion\n0.8%\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Market cap and forward dividend yield as of Dec. 31, 2025.\nI especially like AbbVie's story. The major drugmaker faced a significant patent cliff with its longtime best-selling drug, Humira, losing U.S. patent exclusivity in early 2023. However, AbbVie has roared back. I view it as one of the best healthcare stocks on the market for income investors.\nStocks that Uncle Sam incentivizes to pay dividends\nThe U.S. government exempts certain types of companies from federal income taxes if they return at least 90% of their earnings to shareholders as dividends. Two stocks that fit the bill rank among my favorites for the new year:\nStock\nBusiness Summary\nMarket Cap\nForward Dividend Yield\n4. Ares Capital(NASDAQ: ARCC)\nLeading publicly traded business development company (BDC)\n$14 billion\n9.5%\n5. Realty Income(NYSE: O)\nLarge real estate investment trust (REIT)\n$52 billion\n5.7%\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Market cap and forward dividend yield as of Dec. 31, 2025.\nRealty Income could be especially popular with investors. In addition to a juicy yield, the REIT pays its dividends on a monthly basis. And Realty Income has increased its dividend for 30 consecutive years.\nMagnificent growth plus dividends\nI doubt anyone will buy the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks for their dividends, although several members of the group pay relatively small dividends. However, buying these stocks for their growth prospects is another story. Three of my top Mag7 dividend stocks are:\nStock\nBusiness Summary\nMarket Cap\nForward Dividend Yield\n6. Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nSearch engine leader and cloud services provider\n$3.8 trillion\n0.27%\n7. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)\nConsumer technology giant that makes iPhones, Macs, and other products\n$4 trillion\n0.38%\n8. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT)\nSoftware maker and cloud services provider\n$3.6 trillion\n0.75%\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Market cap and forward dividend yield as of Dec. 31, 2025.\nI'm especially bullish about Google's parent company, Alphabet, in 2026. It checks off nearly every box in the artificial intelligence (AI) arena, with a top-three cloud platform, a leading large language model (LLM), and AI chips that are gaining market momentum.\nEnergizers\nEnergy stocks have long been favorites among income investors for their dependable, high dividend yields. These four energy stocks look especially promising, in my view:\nStock\nBusiness Summary\nMarket Cap\nForward Dividend Yield\n9. Chevron(NYSE: CVX)\nLarge multinational oil and gas company\n$306 billion\n4.5%\n10. Enbridge(NYSE: ENB)\nMidstream energy company and natural gas utility\n$104 billion\n5.8%\n11. Energy Transfer(NYSE: ET)\nMidstream energy company\n$56 billion\n8%\n12. Enterprise Products Partners(NYSE: EPD)\nMidstream energy company\n$69 billion\n6.8%\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Market cap and forward dividend yield as of Dec. 31, 2025.\nEnbridge is perhaps the most intriguing stock in this group. Its pipelines transport 30% of the crude oil transported in North America and roughly one-fifth of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. However, the company is also the largest natural gas utility in North America. Enbridge has increased its dividend for 31 consecutive years.\nUtility players\nUtility stocks typically pay attractive dividends and can be safe havens during turbulent times. I like several utility stocks for 2026, with these seven especially standing out:\nStock\nBusiness Summary\nMarket Cap\nForward Dividend Yield\n13. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners(NYSE: BIP)\nInfrastructure company with assets including utilities\n$16 billion\n4.9%\n14. Brookfield Infrastructure Corp(NYSE: BIPC)\nInfrastructure company with assets including utilities\n$5 billion\n3.8%\n15. Brookfield Renewable Partners(NYSE: BEP)\nRenewable energy provider\n$18 billion\n5.5%\n16. Brookfield Renewable Corp(NYSE: BEPC)\nRenewable energy provider\n$7 billion\n3.9%\n17. Clearway Energy(NYSE: CWEN)\nRenewable energy provider\n$7 billion\n5.4%\n18. Dominion Energy(NYSE: D)\nUtility company serving Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina\n$50 billion\n4.5%\n19. Evergy(NASDAQ: EVRG)\nUtility company serving Kansas and Missouri\n$17 billion\n3.8%\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Market cap and forward dividend yield as of Dec. 31, 2025.\nYou probably noticed that \"Brookfield\" was mentioned four times. Brookfield Renewable and Brookfield Infrastructure each have two listed stocks: one for their limited partnerships (LPs) and one for their corporate entities. These companies are siblings sharing the same parent, Brookfield Asset Management(NYSE: BAM).\nGreat values\nWhat's better than a solid dividend? A solid dividend plus an attractive valuation. These six stocks check off both boxes:\nStock\nBusiness Summary\nMarket Cap\nForward Dividend Yield\n20. Pfizer(NYSE: PFE)\nPharmaceutical company with multiple blockbuster drugs\n$142 billion\n6.9%\n21. Prudential Financial(NYSE: PRU)\nLarge financial services company\n$40 billion\n4.8%\n22. UnitedHealth Group(NYSE: UNH)\nLarge health insurer and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM)\n$300 billion\n2.7%\n23. United Parcel Service(NYSE: UPS)\nLarge package delivery company\n$84 billion\n6.6%\n24. US Bancorp(NYSE: USB)\nLarge bank\n$83 billion\n3.8%\n25. Verizon Communications(NYSE: VZ)\nLarge telecommunications provider\n$172 billion\n6.8%\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Market cap and forward dividend yield as of Dec. 31, 2025.\nAll of these stocks have forward price-to-earnings ratios that are much lower than the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) forward earnings multiple. I think that UnitedHealth Group's stock, in particular, could bounce back in 2026 after struggling in 2025.\nOne oddball\nFinally, I've added one oddball to the list for 2026:\nStock\nBusiness Summary\nMarket Cap\nForward Dividend Yield\n26. FS Credit Opportunities(NYSE: FSCO)\nClosed-end fund (CEF)\n$1.25 billion\n12.8%\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Market cap and forward dividend yield as of Dec. 31, 2025.\nFS Credit Opportunities is a closed-end fund that trades like a company's stock. It operates in a similar way to a BDC. I like its opportunities in direct lending. And I love its ultra-high-yield distribution.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

We can see that individual insiders own the lion's share in the company with 56% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nSo it follows, every decision made by insiders of Nabaltec regarding the company's future would be crucial to them.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Nabaltec.\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Nabaltec?\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Nabaltec. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Nabaltec's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nHedge funds don't have many shares in Nabaltec. The company's CEO Johannes Heckmann is the largest shareholder with 28% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 27% and 3.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\nA more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 2 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 56% stake.\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\nInsider Ownership Of Nabaltec\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur information suggests that insiders own more than half of Nabaltec AG. This gives them effective control of the company. So they have a €61m stake in this €110m business. Most would argue this is a positive, showing strong alignment with shareholders. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nWith a 31% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Nabaltec. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\nNext Steps:\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for Nabaltec that you should be aware of.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Brent crude was down 50 cents, or 0.8%, to $60.26 a barrel.\nUS President Donald Trump has vowed to tap into Venezuela's vast oil reserves after seizing Maduro and said that the US will \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\".\nBut industry analysts have said the move is unlikely to have an immediate impact on how much people and businesses pay for energy.\nExperts have also said it would cost billions of dollars to fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure, which has been in sharp decline since the early 2000s.\nVenezuela's crude production has been \"lacklustre\" for years and now only accounts for around 1% of global oil output, said investment strategist Vasu Menon from OCBC bank.\nThe former chief executive of BP, Lord Browne, told the BBC's Today programme that for Venezuela to revive its oil production would take \"a tremendous amount of skill investment and time\".\nWhile there might be a \"quick pick up\" of some production, he added, output might actually fall while the industry is reorganising.\nStock markets in Europe opened higher, with the UK's FTSE 100 index up 0.3% and close to the 10,000 mark that it hit for the first time on Friday.\nFollowing the events of the weekend firms involved in the defence industry saw some of the biggest gains, with BAE Systems up 4.5% and Babcock International 3.6% higher.\nMining firms also rose following the gain in precious metals prices, with Fresnillo up 3.6%.\nShare markets in Asia made gains as investors focused on news unrelated to developments in Venezuela.\nJapan's Nikkei 225 was up by 2.6% on the first day of trading of the year and new data showed that manufacturing activity stabilised in December.\nMajor indexes in South Korea and China were also higher.\nThe jumps reflect confidence that the fallout from events in Venezuela will remain distant, said Zavier Wong from investment firm eToro.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrnw08qvg7o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D", "published_at": "2026-01-05T08:56:03+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Here's Exactly When to Expect It.", "body": "", "content": "Key Points\n-\nSocial Security benefits are rising by 2.8% in 2026.\n-\nThat raise should come through in January.\n-\nThe timing of that raise depends on your date of birth.\n-\nThe $23,760 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook ›\nSocial Security tends to go undergo different changes from year to year. And one big change happening in 2026 is that benefits are getting a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA.\nThe purpose behind Social Security COLAs is to help ensure that recipient are able to maintain their buying power as inflation pushes costs higher. In 2025, Social Security benefits got a 2.5% COLA, which was the smallest to arrive in several years. So 2026's COLA is an improvement in that regard.\nIf you're looking forward to seeing your Social Security benefits increase this year, you may be wondering when to expect your 2.8% COLA to hit. Here's what to know about the timing of that COLA so you can prepare accordingly.\nKnow your Social Security payment schedule\nYour first Social Security check of the year should be 2.8% higher than it was in 2025. And the timing of that check will depend on your date of birth.\nHere's when to expect your Social Security COLA to arrive:\n-\nJan 14, 2026 if your birthday is on the 1st-10th of the month.\n-\nJan 21, 2026 if your birthday is on the 11th-20th of the month.\n-\nJan 28, 2026 if your birthday is on the 21st-31st of the month.\nKeep in mind that this schedule isn't unique to your first Social Security check of the year. Rather, this is the schedule the Social Security Administration (SSA) tends to follow for all monthly retirement benefits.\nYou may not get your COLA in full\nWhen the SSA announced that benefits would be getting a 2.8% COLA in 2026, it also shared that it expected the average retirement benefit to increase from $2,015 per month to $2,071 following that raise. That means the average recipient is looking at a $56 increase.\nBut those numbers don't account for a rise in the cost of Medicare Part B. And if you're a Medicare enrollee, your Social Security benefits may not increase as much as expected in January.\nMedicare enrollees on Social Security pay their Part B premiums directly out of their monthly benefits. In 2026, the cost of Part B is increasing by $17.90. That increase will eat into your COLA, so your raise will be smaller.\nThe good news is that this year's COLA may be large enough for you to still come away with a boost to your monthly checks after those higher Part B costs are accounted for. Some years, when COLAs are small and Part B increases are substantial, Social Security recipients can be left with no COLA at all.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2026-social-security-cola-arrive-085600072.html", "published_at": "2026-01-05T08:56:00+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Flutterwave operates one of the continent’s widest payments networks, while Mono, often described as the “Plaid for Africa,” has built APIs that allow businesses to access bank data, initiate payments, and verify customers.\nMono has raised about $17.5 million from investors, including Tiger Global, General Catalyst, and Target Global. Sources close to the deal said the acquisition allowed all its investors to at least recoup their capital, with some early backers realizing returns of up to 20x. Mono will continue to operate as an independent product, the companies said in a statement.\nFounded in 2020, Mono, like Plaid, uses APIs that allow users to consent to sharing their bank information, enabling financial institutions to analyze income, spending patterns, and repayment capacity.\nThe company addresses the lack of standardized access to bank data across African markets, where credit bureaus remain limited and fintechs, especially lenders, often rely on customers’ bank transaction histories to assess creditworthiness.\nAccording to CEO Abdulhamid Hassan, nearly all Nigerian digital lenders now rely on Mono’s infrastructure. The company claims to have powered more than 8 million bank account linkages, covering roughly 12% of Nigeria’s banked population. It also claims to have delivered 100 billion financial data points to lending companies and processed millions in direct bank payments. Customers include Visa-backed Moniepoint and GIC-backed PalmPay.\nFor Flutterwave, which powers local and cross-border payments across more than 30 African countries, the deal deepens its vertical integration. In addition to payments, the company can now offer onboarding and identity checks, bank account verification, data-driven risk assessment, and one-time or recurring bank payments within a single stack.\nFlutterwave CEO Olugbenga ‘GB’ Agboola framed the acquisition as a bet on Africa’s next phase of fintech growth. “Payments, data, and trust cannot exist in silos,” he said. “Open banking provides the connective tissue, and Mono has built critical infrastructure in this space.”\nHassan echoed that view, arguing that Africa is entering a credit-driven phase as governments across the continent push lending-led financial inclusion initiatives.

Micro RGB TVs differ from standard LEDs because rather than using white or blue LEDs for their backlighting, they use incredibly small individual blue, red, and green LEDs.\nLike standard LED sets, the light from the LEDs still passes through an LCD panel to produce the images you see on your screen, but because Micro RGB TVs use those tiny, multicolor LEDs, you’ll get better overall color quality and contrast compared to your regular old LED TV.\n“The Samsung Micro RGB TV marks a significant advancement in display technology, offering several advantages over existing options,” Taeyong Son, head of research and development for Samsung Visual Display, told Yahoo Finance via email.\n“Micro RGB technology achieves an optimal balance across picture quality, longevity, and price. It delivers exceptional visual performance with superior resolution, color accuracy, and contrast, while its inorganic micro-LEDs ensure long-term durability.\nThe idea is that by using smaller red, blue, and green LEDs, Micro RGB TVs will not only have better color accuracy, they’ll also see less light bleed. Light bleed happens when an LED TV’s backlight leaks from a bright area of an image to a dark area.\nIf you’ve ever looked at a full moon in a movie and seen some fuzzy white coloring around it, that’s likely from light bleed. Micro RGB TVs won’t completely eliminate the problem, though it’ll likely be far less noticeable.\nBoth Samsung and LG also sell their own lines of OLED TVs, which create the images you see by directly lighting up and turning off thousands of LEDs. Because OLED TVs control individual LEDs, they have incredible color contrast and deep blacks. But they’re also more expensive than LED TVs.\nSamsung and LG last debuted a new TV technology back in 2018 with the announcements of their Micro LED televisions. Though those sets are still incredibly expensive. Samsung’s 89-inch Micro LED TV is currently listed at $109,999 on Best Buy’s website.\nAccording to Son, Micro RGB TVs should be far more accessible to consumers.\n“Micro RGB was engineered from the start to be adaptable and cost-effective. By utilizing micro-sized RGB LEDs as a backlight rather than self-emissive pixels, we reduce manufacturing complexity compared to Micro LED, making it easier to produce at various sizes and price points,” Son explained.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ces-new-tv-tech-from-samsung-lg-promises-brighter-colors-better-image-quality-in-2026-030027975.html", "published_at": "2026-01-05T03:00:27+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Silagadze will be speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus Hong Kong conference in February 2026\nSilagadze described 2025 as a turning point for Ethereum, marked by a wave of institutional onboarding. While staking remains limited within ETFs, Silagadze said other institutional vehicles, like digital asset treasuries (DATs) have moved faster.\n“A bunch of them have already started deploying into ether.fi,” he said, calling those early adopters “very much on the bleeding edge.” DATs he added, “certainly had a positive impact on the price” of ether.\nEther was at its lowest point in 2025 at $1,472 in April, while during the height of the DAT trend, ether shot up to $4,832.\nLooking ahead, Silagadze said his excitement for 2026 centers on the continued maturation of Ethereum’s financial ecosystem.\n\"The whole crypto neobank movement… seems to be like a rapidly growing trend, just lots of companies going into space and seeing growth there,” he said.\nIn Silagadze’s view, neobanks represent one of the clearest paths to sustained adoption, especially as stablecoins become more deeply embedded in global finance. These platforms, he argued, are better positioned than ETFs to expose users to onchain activity and yield.\nUltimately, Silagadze said he believes Ethereum’s success in 2026 will depend on its ability to deliver practical utility at scale.\n“I really believe that the adoption is going to come from a lot of these neobank type players,” he said, arguing that more user activity will naturally follow. That means focusing on “more real-world use cases,” from tokenized stocks to accessible banking services, and moving beyond what he sees as an overemphasis on gambling-driven applications.\nRead more: How Ether.fi's Mike Silagadze Retained TVL as Restaking Lost Its Luster", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/neobanks-fuel-ethereums-2026-growth-150000269.html", "published_at": "2026-01-04T15:00:00+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}
{"article_id": "7aa23afb64cba811", "source": "telegraph", "headline": "How to drive your car safely in snow and ice this winter", "body": "Here is the best advice to help you stay safe on the road in inclement weather this winter", "content": "4. Pick the correct lights\nRemember, you mustn’t use your fog lamps unless the visibility is very poor – rear fog lamps will dazzle other road users, and the effect is intensified when there is spray from melted snow coming out from the rear of the car. Front fog lamps have the same effect, but for cars ahead of you, especially when snow on the road is reflecting the light back up at them.\nThe Highway Code says that you should only use your fog lamps when the visibility drops below 100m. If you’re not sure when that is, a good rule of thumb is to work out whether you can see the tail lights of the car in front. If you can’t, you (and they) should be using rear fog lamps. However, if you can, you probably don’t need them.\nSnow does not mean you need to use your main beam headlights any more or less often than you would normally. You shouldn’t leave them on when driving towards or behind other traffic, as it will dazzle those drivers.\nIf you’re in any doubt about which lights to use, put yourself in the position of other drivers around you. Ask yourself what your car looks like to them, whether they can see you and whether they might be blinded by any of your lights.\n5. Keep your distance\nCast your mind back to your driving test, and you’ll remember that stopping distances increase in icy conditions. But can you remember by how much?\nIn actual fact, it can take as much as 10 times as long to stop on an icy road as it does on a dry one. If you can, you should increase the distance between you and the car you’re following by about that much.\nA good rule of thumb is that you should be around 20 seconds behind the car in front of you if the road is icy. That way, if that car has to stop suddenly – or, worse still, crashes into a car in front – you will have time to stop, or take avoiding action.\nTo check you’re far enough away, watch for the car in front to pass an object – a lamp post, bridge or sign. Then count how many seconds go by before you pass the same object. If it’s under 20 seconds, you should back off and allow more space.\nOne of the main problems with this strategy is that not everybody is playing the same game. If you leave a 20-second gap between your car and the one in front, another car or van will probably try to fill that gap. Be aware of this and be prepared to give way to somebody driving antisocially.\n6. Drive smoothly and gently\nDriving in ice and snow isn’t just about leaving more space, though. It requires a very different driving style that relatively few people are aware of.\nFor starters, your use of all the controls – steering, accelerator and brake – should be as smooth, slow and progressive as you can make them. Abrupt changes in the car’s attitude will cause the tyres to lose what little grip on the road’s surface they have. That could lead to you skidding, spinning your wheels, or getting stuck before you’ve even pulled away.\nIn a manual car, move away slowly by slipping the clutch as gently as you can, keeping the engine revs low, and ensure you change gear early as you accelerate and late as you decelerate, again so that you keep the revs to a minimum. Lower revs mean the engine is turning more slowly, which reduces the risk of wheelspin.\nIf you’re driving an automatic or four-wheel-drive car, check to see whether it has a low-ratio mode. This can be indicated by a snowflake symbol or an ‘L’ on a switch near to the gear lever. If it has one of these, use it. You should avoid using Sport mode in an automatic car that’s so-equipped. Some automatic cars have a gearchange setting optimised for ice and snow, normally denoted by a snowflake icon; select this on ice and compacted snow.\nAt the same time, try to avoid using settings specifically for low-traction environments when driving on gritted or cleared tarmac. Certain mechanisms within the car could be put under undue strain when used in high-grip situations.\nYou should also try and avoid sudden manoeuvres that might unbalance the car, such as sharp steering or braking. Doing so increases the likelihood of your car skidding.\n7. Learn how to deal with skidding\nIt is a good idea to gently test your brakes and steering now and again to get an idea of how slippery the road is. Obviously, you should pick a straight, clear piece of road away from any junctions, and make sure there’s nobody following you when you do so.\nIt’s also advisable to keep the volume of your radio turned down when driving on snow. Your ears can often give you the first warning that you’ve hit a slippery patch. Driving through snow patches will create more tyre noise than usual thanks to its crunching, as well as the roar of snow being kicked up into the wheel arches. Conversely, if the tyre noise suddenly goes quiet, that can mean you’re driving on a patch of ice.\nIf you hit a patch of slippery road and you feel the car start to skid, lift your foot off the accelerator and allow the speed to drop by itself until you regain control. Avoid using the brakes, as this will prolong the skid. If the car starts to spin while you are skidding, steer into the direction of the spin and allow the car to straighten up.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/advice/how-to-drive-safely-snow-ice-frozen-icy-road-winter-uk/", "published_at": "2026-01-05T09:00:36+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

For him and for Fulham, it was worth the wait.

Reed’s shot scorched through the freezing afternoon air, travelling with truly outrageous power, and dipped into the top corner of Alisson Becker’s net at the last possible moment.\nThis was the least likely of goals, scored by the least likely of players.

At any level. And he was up against no less than Pep Guardiola, the greatest coach of his generation, who has been in the technical area for 1,012 matches.\nIt might the first and the last for McFarlane although the way he coached Chelsea and the way he spoke afterwards suggests otherwise. He looks like one to watch.\nNot least because the enduring image was Guardiola raising his eyes to the sky and howling in frustration while McFarlane celebrated a few feet away from him after Enzo Fernández’s deserved equalising goal deep into stoppage time.\nChelsea’s rookie coach outwits Guardiola to dent Man City title hopes\n“Hang it in the Louvre”, as they say. Hopefully for McFarlane that image will have been captured by a photographer because whatever the 40-year-old goes on to achieve in his career he should always have that moment.\n“It was amazing, stuff you dream about. Pep Guardiola, Premier League game, amazing,” McFarlane said afterwards.\nAnd to think, also, that prior to joining Southampton, McFarlane was a youth team coach at Manchester City before, last week, being asked to step up from his role with Chelsea’s Under-21s to take the senior team following the abrupt departure of Enzo Maresca and his staff.\nCity will feel they threw it away – and their game management was questionable, while defensive injuries mount – but whatever the reason this was a highly damaging draw for them.\nFollowing on from the midweek draw at Sunderland, they are now suddenly six points behind Arsenal who are beginning to have the relentless sheen and robustness of potential champions.\nIf that happens how they and Mikel Arteta will raise a toast to McFarlane who is expected to take Chelsea training tomorrow before handing over to Liam Rosenior who has flown in to London to seal his move from Strasbourg.\nAt times in the last few days it has felt that the Chelsea ownership believe they can operate the club without a head coach. Was this performance a confirmation of that?\nNo, it would do a huge disservice to McFarlane who showed some astute in-game management, shift of tactics and substitutions. His starting line-up looked defensive and when he withdrew Estêvão Willian at half-time and brought on Andrey Santos it appeared to be turning into an exercise in damage limitation with City 1-0 up, on top, having hit the post through Erling Haaland and created more chances.\nNot so, as McFarlane explained afterwards. “They [City] had a lot of control and we were getting pinned back,” he said. “So, we made a change at half-time to go more man-for-man against the ball and disrupt their rhythm. The shape changed and the subs we made really helped us.”\nIt all worked. It meant Fernández – who scored of course – moved further forward with Cole Palmer switched to the right. When Liam Delap came on, replacing the ineffective João Pedro, there was also more running power to stretch City’s creaking defence which lost Josko Gvardiol and Rúben Dias to injury.\n“We can talk about that but the most impressive thing was the players 1-0 down at the Etihad with an interim manager and with players going ill on the day of the game,” McFarlane added.\nIt was and he will also have the moment that Chelsea captain Reece James – outstanding in midfield, a response to those who claim the team does not have leaders – pushed him forward to take the acclaim from the travelling supporters.\nTo think how it had looked and sounded so different. Tijjani Reijnders had given City their first-half lead as they countered through Rodri and Rayan Cherki with the midfielder cleverly rolling his studs over the ball before striking a powerful rising shot beyond stand-in goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen.\nAt that time the main noise from the Chelsea fans had been chants of “Roman Abramovich” which felt like a protest against the current ownership and it appeared to be a question of just how many City would score.\nIt did not happen. They simply did not create enough and they did not show the ruthlessness of a side destined for the title. A second goal would have killed Chelsea’s resistance but instead they were encouraged with Pedro Neto sidefooting wastefully over, after Fernández set him up, and Delap forcing an alert block from Gianluigi Donnarumma.\nBy the time the board showed six minutes of added time Chelsea were the most likely to score and City were trying to run the clock down. Then Malo Gusto crossed low from the right, Donnarumma superbly parried Fernández’s first effort only for him to stab home the rebound.\nThe time was at 93 minutes and 14 seconds – almost precisely (just six seconds earlier) the same as that famous Sergio Agüero goal back in 2012. That delivered City’s first Premier League title. We cannot say that Fernández – a fellow Argentinian – did not score the goal that helped deny them another. Not yet anyway. But it may have a greater bearing come May.\nCity suffer double injury blow\nPep Guardiola’s title hopes have been hit with a double injury blow after Rúben Dias and Josko Gvardiol were forced off injured in the draw against Chelsea.\nGuardiola’s first-choice centre-backs will be scanned on Monday to determine the extent of the damage suffered in the second half, with Manchester City dropping more points to lose ground on leaders Arsenal.\nWith John Stones already out and Nathan Aké unable to play matches in quick succession, Guardiola faces an injury crisis ahead of a crucial game against Brighton and Hove Albion on Wednesday.\n“We’ll see but it doesn’t look good,” said Guardiola. “Him [Gvardiol] and Rúben, we’ll see what happens. With Rúben it looks like muscle. I didn’t speak to the doctor but if Rúben is out it’s because he felt something.”\nGvardiol was helped down the tunnel by two City staff as he was unable to put weight on his left ankle, while Dias was forced off with nine minutes left after feeling a strain off the ball.\n“We have a lot [of injuries]. John Stones is missing for I don’t know how many months. Rúben now will be out, Josko will be out. Nathan, always we know with Nathan he cannot play regularly.\n“It’s the situation. Stay strong and we will find a solution. The spirit is there and will be there. Of course I have concerns. Have you seen the bench today? Four players from the academy and now we will have more. We don’t have players.”\nAfter Dias went off, Chelsea equalised in the 94th minute through Enzo Fernández, cancelling out Tijjani Reijnders’ strike. Despite the injury blows, Guardiola must decide whether he goes into the January market for a defender if they are out long-term.\n“I don’t think so but we’ll see what happens because I know Rúben is a big loss and Josko is a big loss,” said the City manager.\n‘This group is exceptional’: Chelsea interim manager Calum McFarlane’s reaction\n“I think the main thing is for the three days we have worked with the players, they are open. They are hard-working, honest, they want to do the right things. I can’t speak about my changes more than them buying into it and applying what we wanted them to do. I thought they did that exceptionally well in the second half.”\n“The group have been exceptional. As a [under] 21 staff coming in, we couldn’t ask for anything more. No egos, completely on board, training has been brilliant. Enzo, Reece, Tosin, in terms of their leadership and management of the group now the manager is gone and there is an interim in ... Levi, Cucu[rella], Moises, all here travelling even though they know they aren’t going to play.\nThe togetherness in the group is exceptional. That is why this group can win big games and big moments, they have done it again today. At 1-0 down at half-time, interim manager, players injured, everyone is expecting the worst. But the character this group has is why they can go and beat PSG, beat Barca, play with 10 men against Arsenal and be the better team, it’s why they can do this at the Etihad. They are an exceptional group of people.\n[On whether the experience has given him a taste for this] Obviously I’m inexperienced, but I really enjoyed it. In the future, I would love to do that but at the moment, I love my role, my job. I’ve got a really good role at Chelsea, I am just here to support in the short-term until the new manager comes in and I’m glad I can do that and support the players.”\n‘We had chances to close the game’: Pep Guardiola’s reaction\n“One action and [they] score a goal. We had a lot of actions, we play a fantastic game, so pity for the result.\n[On whether he was particularly pleased with the first 45 minutes] 90 minutes. 95. We played so good all game, it’s normal in the second half they make a step-up, they were more aggressive because normally Chelsea is not like that, they make a step-up, it was more difficult. We have two options in the beginning of the game because we lose easier balls with Tijjani [Reijnders] and Matheus [Nunes].\nBut the rest, we had chances in the right moment to close the game, in the end we couldn’t do it and when it went 1-0, anything can happen with the quality they had.\n[How are Dias and Gvardiol?] It doesn’t look good, we’ll see the next days.\nWe knew when you have all the squad, you can compete and rotate. Right now, it’s the situation and we will have another energy to get back. I cannot change the [schedule ahead], it is where it is.”\nChelsea’s changes worked\nChelsea had eight shots in the match and seven came in the second half. Neto probably should have scored minutes after the restart. There were warning signs before Enzo’s late, late equaliser.\nCallum McFarlane got the team playing in a more aggressive way and is unbeaten as a professional football manager.\n‘We are in a difficult moment’: Reece James’s post-match reaction\n“We had to accept what went on earlier in the week and put it behind us. We came here with a game plan, we know what level we can perform at when we are all together and all firing. The first half we made a slight error for their goal, but the second half, we grew into the game, knew a chance would come and this guy took his chance when it came.\nCredit to the staff that stepped up. They haven’t been in this role before, to come to City away as your first first-team game is difficult. We had to adapt fast, the first half we felt they had too much of the ball, we had to make slight adjustments and came out with a slightly different plan in the second half.\nWe are in a difficult moment, we have to stand together, we are one. We missed many people that travelled today, but so many other players stepped up. We fought as a team today and I’m proud of the boys ... we dug in and got a point.\nWe know nothing at the moment [in terms of when a new manager comes in], this whole week was about this game. What happens behind the scenes is not down to us. We take a point at a really difficult place to come, we have to recover, we play again in a few days.”\n90+6 min: Man City 1 Chelsea 1\nPep looks like he’s seen a ghost. City have wasted so many good positions, they have brought this on to themselves.\nCity were time-wasting and professional fouling before that Enzo equaliser. They deserved that late blow. Chelsea’s bench were pretty confident that all their players were onside, even if there was a VAR delay. With the unrestrained passion of the celebration, most would be glad the goal stood.\nGOAL!\nMan City 1 Chelsea 1 (Enzo) A late point-saver? From the free-kick James sends Gusto down the right and he storms round O’Reilly to cross. Ake slides in but only gets a toe on it and the ball spins towards the back post where Enzo has a couple of bites at it, thwarted at first by Donnarumma but then pokes it in.\n90+2 min: Man City 1 Chelsea 0\nChelsea are looking to go long and James picks out Gusto’s run up the right. He beats Ake to the pass but then flops on to the floor as if hoping for a free-kick that does not come.\nHaaland almost sent through with a scooped pass. Applause from the crowd, but Guardiola is going ballistic at his team. He saw that Jeremy Doku was free on the left and wanted a simple pass.\n87 min: Man City 1 Chelsea 0\nChelsea just haven’t been good enough with their forward passes consistently even though City look as if they’re exhausted.\nRuben Dias coming off rather than Khusanov is a concern for City, who have struggled with injuries in that position. John Stones has been out and Gvardiol injured in this game. Interesting that Nathan Ake has been given minutes here after starting against Sunderland on Thursday. There have been Premier League clubs monitoring his situation, with the Sunderland start his first since October 18. Perhaps Guardiola is trying to keep him happy.\n78 min: Man City 1 Chelsea 0\nDelap shoves Kushanov into the advertising hoardings after the defender held him off in the box and shepherded the ball out for a goal-kick. Nunes, Dias and Bernardo go garrity with their former team-mate, banging chests and prodding him while Delap just smiles. Eventually Delap and Nunes are booked.\n76 min: Man City 1 Chelsea 0\nGroans echo around the Etihad after Doku’s glorious right-foot pass from the left sends Foden free down the wing. But with only one Chelsea defender between him and Cherki he is mortified to see Badiashile judging the pass perfectly to stop it reaching its target who would have been one-on-one with Jorgensen.\n73 min: Man City 1 Chelsea 0\nDelap rolls Khusanov in the box, latching on to Neto’s pass, to shoot. Khusanov slid in to block and the ball skipped up off his toe and Donnarumma managed to block it with the right side of his chest and biceps.\nThey know all about Liam Delap here at the Etihad Stadium. He probably would be playing for them today if it wasn’t for a certain Erling Haaland being at the club. That was a decent effort by the England hopeful, forcing a save from Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n70 min: Man City 1 Chelsea 0\nFine City move. Donnarumma chips it up to Haaland who nods it down the right for Cherki. The No 10 glides into the box then squares it for Bernardo but didn’t get enough on the pass, allowing Hato the time to slide in and knock it away as Bernardo, with eyes widened, drew back his left foot to shoot.\nDoku → Reijnders.\nReece James playing in central midfield for the last month has gone under the radar a bit. It is an option for Thomas Tuchel at the World Cup next year. James has had a decent afternoon, at the heart of Chelsea’s best moves forwards and positionally disciplined. He has picked up a booking, which was slightly unfortunate for a follow-through that he could do little about.\nCity have defended well so far when Chelsea have got into a decent positions. McFarlane has his team playing in a more attacking way now, with Liam Delap up front and getting support from Pedro Neto and Cole Palmer.\n64 min: Man City 1 Chelsea 0\nA couple of careless Chelsea passes almost let Haaland and Cherki in but first Hato and then Badiashile sweep up the mess.\nAbdukodir Khusanov is making just his second Premier League appearance since Sept 21 when he was taken off at half-time against Arsenal. He has slotted straight in at centre-back alongside Ruben Dias. But while Pep Guardiola has not been using him regularly, the City manager still rates last January’s signings – including Khusanov – as season-saving. Without them, City would be playing in the Europa Conference League, according to Guardiola.\n52 min: Man City 1 Chelsea 0\nReece James helps Gvardiol, who has hurt his ankle, off.\nKhusanov → Gvardiol.\nChelsea are playing 3-4-2-1 with Gusto and Pedro Neto as wing-backs and Palmer and Enzo behind Joao Pedro.\nJames is booked for following through on Rodri and catching him on the top of the foot with his studs.\n49 min: Man City 1 Chelsea 0\nNeto scoops a shot over from eight yards. Had to score. Chelsea had broken after Gvardiol went down and had a 4v3 overload. Palmer and Enzo did very well to break into the box and then Enzo gift-wrapped the opportunity that Pedro Neto squandered.\nCity are not particularly happy with that Chelsea chance as Josko Gvardiol was down injured as Pedro Neto shot over. He is still getting treatment.\nIn fact, the tackle from Malo Gusto was strong enough for Gvardiol to come off. He is being helped by two members of the City staff down the tunnel for treatment.\n47 min: Man City 1 Chelsea 0\nPedro Neto is played down the left by Enzo’s clever dink past Cherki. He sprints away from Nunes and has time and space to shoot but decides to go up a cul de sac near the byline and cut the ball back. Only Joao Pedro was with him and he was surrounded so the ball deflects off Dias and is easily caught by Donnarumma.\nHalf-time: Man City 1 Chelsea 0\nA strange half, dominated by City in terms of possession and touches in the opposition box but Chelsea, James and Gusto in particularly, were defending very well. But there was no outlet for them when they did win the ball back and seemed resigned to sitting back and trying to repel each wave of attack. For most of the half Cuty’s exertions were undone by a lack of precision and some overplaying. And then Reijnders seized his chance by the slack of its collar and smashed in the opener.\n44 min: Man City 1 Chelsea 0\nIt may have been coming but Chelsea had a hand in it when Palmer lost the ball in a promising position 30 yards from goal on a rare foray up front.\nThat goal had many different faces of City. Rodri was at the heart of it - just touching the ball to Cherki for him to set up the move. When the ball broke for Tijjani Reinders, there was the option to find Haaland but the Dutch midfielder rolled his studs over the ball to make a yard of space and finish. This will be tough going now for Chelsea. Maybe a change at half-time to get Garnacho in the game.\n40 min: Man City 0 Chelsea 0\nThe corner comes to naught but City regroup to attack down the left with O’Reilly challenging James, illegally according to Gary Neville, switching it across to the inside right to Haaland who steps in on to his left, in that old familiar way, and raps a shot on to the inside of the left post. It rebounds across the six-yard line and away from danger.\n38 min: Man City 0 Chelsea 0\nCity corner after Haaland’s left-foot shot from 18 yards hits Badiashile’s heel as he knelt to block and wobbles towards goal. Jorgensen dives to his left to turn it behind.\nCity are getting closer here. Erling Haaland has just had an effort tipped around the post and then struck the woodwork, while Bernardo Silva cleared the crossbar after cutting inside. McFarlane’s tactic is to get men behind the ball. Yes, they are a flat-back four but Reece James and Josh Acheampong sitting in front of them means they can stretch out with five or six across the backline.\n36 min: Man City 0 Chelsea 0\nBernardo has a stuttering run in from the left as he stops to try to shake off Gusto before starting again, feinting left and right, but Gusto doesn’t give up and stalks him all the way unil Bernardo reaches the right of the D and tries to bend a left-foot shot into the top corner around the left-back which sails out for a goal-kick. Too straight. Not enough curve.\n34 min: Man City 0 Chelsea 0\nJames again smells the danger of a City pass or cross and snuffs it out with excellent positioning. He’s such a fine player. Has to be England’s starting right-back if he stays fit. Nunes’ cute pass to Cherki doesn’t come off but Gusto, safety first, lumps the ball forward to Donnarumma rather than risk a square pass. No runners off Joao Pedro as it’s all hands to the pump in defence.\n29 min: Man City 0 Chelsea 0\nGood defending from Badiashile to track Haaland’s run and compete for the cross stood up by Reijnders on the run from the left. Badiashile gets enough brow on it to squeeze it behind for a corner which, again, Chelsea defend solidly.\nThis is tighter than expected this game. Chelsea are playing quite well, breaking forward at times and seeing a decent effort from Estevao blocked in the penalty area. Nothing too much from City yet and Pep Guardiola is clearly not happy - he made his feelings clear during a conversation with Josko Gvardiol.\n20 min: Man City 0 Chelsea 0\nCity break from that block with a wonderful diagonal pass from Nunes out to Reijnders on the left. The Holland midfielder rattles over a pass to the right of the D that Foden cushions beautifully with his right to wrongfoot Gusto and allow him to throw his balance on to his left to shoot but he screws his effort about a yard wide.\n16 min: Man City 0 Chelsea 0\nThe Chelsea fans, like their City counterparts, must be frozen but Estevao is enough to warm the Baltic Sea and his promising but ultimately ineffective run down the right triggers a chorus of ‘Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea!’\nGary Neville says the game is tranquil. The players look knackered… and still one more round of ‘festive’ fixtures to come on Wednesday.\n11 min: Man City 0 Chelsea 0\nEnzo lazily throws out an arm to try to stop Cherki rather than engaging after jockeying him and leaves James exposed as City’s No 10 runs off ahead after brushing Fernandez away. James sticks his leg across Cherki in full flight and concedes the free-kick, right of centre, 25 yards out.\n5 min: Man City 0 Chelsea 0\nJorgensen pumps the ball 70 yards having spotted Gusto’s clever run infield but so did Donnarumma and he bounded out of his box to head the bouncing ball to a team-mate and City turn defence into attack. Sleet falling now. Reijnders is penalised for a push and that’s the end of that.\n3 min: Man City 0 Chelsea 0\nDias holds off Gusto and lets the ball run out for a throw-in. Nunes’ pass inside from the right, looking for Bernardo, is picked off by Enzo Fernandez. Bernardo sticks with him and blocks his cross, turning it behind for a corner from which Joao Pedro is penalised for a foul on Donnarumma.\n1 min: Man City 0 Chelsea 0\nCole Palmer kicks off for Chelsea and knocks the ball straight back to Jorgensen who targets the right wing. Reijnders, who is playing on the left, picks it up and drives forward but can’t retain possession.\nThe Etihad Stadium just paid an “In Memoriam” to those associated with Manchester City and Chelsea who passed away in 2025. No bigger cheer than for Ricky Hatton when his name was read out.\nThe teams are out\nCity are in sky blue and white, Chelsea in their home strip of royal blue and white.\nA quick reminder of the line-ups:\nMan City Donnarumma; Nunes, Dias, Gvardiol, O’Reilly; Rodri, Bernardo, Reijnders; Cherki, Foden; Haaland.\nSubstitutes Trafford, Ake, Doku, Khusanov, McAidoo, Mukasa, Lewis, Mfuni, R Heskey.\nChelsea Jorgensen; Acheampong, Chalobah, Badiashile, Gusto; James, Fernandez; Estevao, Palmer, Pedro Neto; Joao Pedro.\nSubstitutes Garnacho, Guiu, Hato, Santos, Bynoe-Gittens, Delap, Adarabioyo, Merrick, Slonina.\nReferee Michael Oliver (Ashington).\nCalum McFarlane speaks to Sky Sports\nI’m feeling good, calm. We’ve had some good days training, good prep and the lads are in a good place. We’ve just tried to get the feeling in the group right. It’s always hard when a manager leaves. We’ve tried to pick them up socially and emotionally and I think they’re ready. You have to find the balance, get the feeling right and the emotion right so the lads are in a good place and I think we’ve done a good job over the last few days.\nBlog exclusive!\nManchester City centre-back Jahmai Simpson-Pusey, 20, is undergoing a medical at German club Cologne ahead of a loan move to the Bundlesliga outfit. The England Under-20 international was at Celtic for the first half of the season but returned from his loan after finding first-team opportunities difficult.\nOn the Chelsea line-up\nChelsea caretaker boss Calum McFarlane has made a big call dropping Alejandro Garnacho from his starting line-up. There is a forced change as Robert Sanchez was injured on the eve of the match so Filip Jorgensen starts his first Premier League game. He came off the bench at the start of the season when Sanchez was sent off against Manchester United.\nRodri starts for City\nThere were a few flakes of snow on the east side if Manchester. It is bitterly cold here for Chelsea’s first match since the departure of Enzo Maresca. As one ex-Chelsea player pointed out in the press room, it is a cup final for Calum McFarlane – if the caretaker boss can win here, he could get another game in charge. Liam Rosenior is expected to get the nod.\nRodri starts for Man City. It is his first start since October, when he was injured against Brentford and then suffered a setback on his comeback.\nPreview: Maestro vs novice\nGood evening and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League match between Manchester City and Chelsea, the teams that started the day in third and sixth. City, unbeaten in seven though their six-match winning steak in the Premier League was abruptly ended when they hit the wall, and the rock of Sunderland’s defence at home, on New Year’ Day, can narrow Arsenal’s lead to four points with victory today and given they have beaten Chelsea six times and drawn once on their last seven visits in league and cup to the Etihad, they would be pretty confident of doing so even if Chelsea were not rocking up with a novice caretaker manager.\nCalum McFarlane, who stepped up when Enzo Maresca found a couple of bootprints across the seat of his pants five days ago, joins a lengthy list of Chelsea interims over the past 15 years, following Roberto Di Matteo, Rafa Benítez, Steve Holland, Guus Hiddink in a second stint, Bruno Saltor and Frank Lampard in taking temporary control. Of those six only Lampard lost his first game in charge (again in a second stint), going down 2-0 to Real Madrid and then by the same score against Brentford at Stamford Bridge if you think judging him by defeat against the champions of Europe is too harsh.\nThe Under-21 head coach, who has worked at Southampton and Man City after a few years working at Kinetic Academy, is without long-term absentees Levi Colwill, Roméo Lavia, Mykhailo Mudryk and Jorrel Hato while Moises Caicedo is suspended. Chelsea, looking to improve a run of one win, four draws and two defeats in Maresca’s last seven games, may also be lacking Marc Cucurella who has a thigh strain.\nCity have two players away at the Africa Cup of Nations, Rayan Aït-Nouri and Omar Marmoush, and three recovering from injury in Oscar Bobb, John Stones and Mateo Kovacic. Savinho and Nico González were hurt during the draw with Sunderland but have not been definitively ruled out.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2026/01/04/man-city-vs-chelsea-live-score-latest-premier-league-update/", "published_at": "2026-01-04T21:38:38+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

Think again.\nThis handsome Leicester victory, with a bonus point sewn up before half-time, owed as much to the artists behind the pack as the artisans within it. Billy Searle and Will Wand were wonderful for Leicester in that punchy first-half showing but Freddie Steward, Adam Radwan – scorers of three Tigers tries between them – and Ollie Hassell-Collins all played their part, too. Jack van Poortvliet, on his first start since October, was sharp at scrum-half and Orlando Bailey, one of English rugby’s forgotten prospects, had his best game in a Leicester shirt at inside centre. Wand, certainly, was the best player on the park in the opening 40 minutes but the return of Emeka Ilione, the back row on England’s radar, gave the centre stiff competition after half-time.", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2026/01/04/leicester-tigers-v-saracens-live-score-latest-prem-rugby/", "published_at": "2026-01-04T19:13:20+00:00", "fetched_at": "2026-01-05T09:20:04.399632+00:00", "resolution": {"success": true, "method": "trafilatura", "error": null}}

If you lose the three of them at the same time, any team in the world will struggle. And now Mount.\n“You have all the data and you can sense that three guys create most of the chances for us. And if you lose not one but all three at the same time, of course we are going to struggle.”\nAmorim said the impact was being felt not just from open play but also from set-pieces. “Then you have to put set pieces in that. Who is kicking the set pieces? Amad, Bryan and Bruno,” he said. “So everything is combined and we just need to acknowledge that.\n“The important thing is to understand why we struggled in the last three games in creation and quality in the game. I think it’s clear.”\nWith eight senior players missing through injury and the Afcon Amorim said it was “impossible” for anyone to leave this month as things stand. Joshua Zirkzee, Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte all face uncertain futures.\n“If you look at our squad, I think it’s impossible for someone to leave,” Amorim said. “But that is … they need to talk with Jason [Wilcox, the director of football].”\nAmorim had suggested on Christmas Eve, prior to the Newcastle game, that he was not necessarily going to get the time and money required to play the “perfect 3-4-3” and as such was needing to adapt his system. “I have the feeling that if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3, we need to spend a lot of money and we need time,” he said. “So, I’m starting to understand that that is not going to happen so maybe I have to adapt.”\nBut Amorim was reluctant to discuss those remarks in further detail ahead of the Leeds match. “I don’t want to talk about that. I just focus on the Leeds game,” he said.\nAsked if he regretted making those comments, Amorim added: “No, no, no. But I don’t want to talk about it. I don’t want to talk about that.
